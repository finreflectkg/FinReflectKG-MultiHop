      "question": "How did Mastercard's risk management methodology for settlement exposure evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of its estimated settlement exposure amounts and the frequency of risk management reviews, amid ongoing regulatory investigations and legal challenges?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Mastercard disclosed its risk management methodology, emphasizing the requirement for certain customers not meeting risk standards to enter into risk mitigation arrangements such as cash collateral and letters of credit, while also stating that the estimated settlement exposure amounts were revised as necessary. By 2023, the company highlighted its global risk management policies and procedures, including regular monitoring of the credit risk portfolio and adequacy of risk mitigation arrangements, with a specific focus on evolving regulatory scrutiny, including the FTC investigation and the DOJ CID. In 2024, Mastercard reiterated its risk management framework but noted an increase in legal and regulatory scrutiny, including new investigations by the European Commission, and emphasized periodic reviews of its methodology. Despite these challenges, the company maintained that historically, losses from customer settlement failures remained low, and it continued to refine its risk management methodology in response to exposure changes and regulatory pressures.",

          "chunk_text": "## U.S. Liability Shift Litigation\n\nIn 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class acEon complaint was filed in federal court in California alleging that Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover (the  'Network  Defendants'),  EMVCo,  and  a  number  of  issuing  banks  (the  'Bank  Defendants')  engaged  in  a  conspiracy  to  shiV  fraud  liability  for  card  present tra ns a cEons   from  is s ui ng  ba nks   to  mercha nts   not  yet  i n  complia nce  with  the  s ta nda rds   for  EMV  chip  ca rds   in  the  United  Sta tes   (the  'EMV  Lia bility  ShiV'),  in vi ol a Eon  of  the  Sherma n  Act a nd  Ca lifornia  la w.  Pla inEffs  a llege da ma ges  equa l to the va lue of a ll cha rgeba cks  for which cla s s  members  beca me liable as a result of the EMV Liability ShiV on October 1, 2015. The plainEffs seek treble damages, aNorney's fees and costs and an injuncEon against future violaEons of governing  law. The  district  court  denied  the  Network  Defendants'  moEon  to  dismiss  the  complaint,  but  granted  such  a  moEon  for  EMVCo  and  the  Bank Defendants. In 2017, the district court transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. MDL LiEgaEon Cases described above. In 2020, the district court issued an order granEng the plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon. The plainEffs have submiNed expert reports that allege aggregate s i ngl e   da ma ge s   i n  e xce s s   of  $1  bi l l i on  a ga i ns t  the  four  Ne twork  De fe nda nts . The   Ne twork  De fe nda nts   s ubmi Ned  expert  reports   rebuUng  both  lia bility  a nd damages and all briefs on summary judgment have been submiNed. In September 2024, the district court denied the Network Defendants' moEon for summary judgment.\n\n## Telephone Consumer Protection Class Action\n\nMastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer ProtecEon Act ('TCPA') class acEon pending in Florida.  The plainEffs are individuals and businesses who allege  that  approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them adverEsing a Mastercard co-brand card issued by First Arkansas Bank ('FAB'). The  TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax. Mastercard has asserted various defenses to the claims, and has noEfied FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed). In 2019, the Federal CommunicaEons Commission ('FCC') issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services that are received online via email. In 2021, the trial court granted plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon, but narrowed the s cope of the class to stand alone fax recipients only. Mastercard's request to appeal that decision was denied. Briefing on plainEffs' moEon to amend the class definition and Mastercard's cross-motion to decertify the stand alone fax recipient class was completed in April 2023 and the parties await the court's decision.\n\n## U.S. Department of Justice Investigation\n\nIn  March  2023,  Mastercard  received  a  Civil  InvesEgaEve  Demand  ('CID')  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  JusEce  AnEtrust  Division  ('DOJ')  seeking  documents  and i nformaEon regarding a potenEal violaEon of SecEons 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act.  The CID focuses on Mastercard's U.S. debit program and compeEEon with other payment networks and technologies. Mastercard is cooperating with the DOJ in connection with the CID.\n\n## European Commission Investigation\n\nIn August 2024, Mastercard received a formal request for informaEon from the European Commission seeking documents and informaEon in connecEon with an i nves EgaEon into alleged anE-compeEEve behavior of certain card scheme services in the European Union/EEA.  The request focuses on Mastercard's pracEces regarding network fees related to acquirers. Mastercard is cooperating with the European Commission in connection with the request.\n\n## Note 22. Settlement and Other Risk Management\n\nMastercard's rules guarantee the seNlement of many of the payment network transacEons between its customers ('seNlement risk').  SeNlement exposure is the s e Nl e ment  ri s k  to  cus tomers   under  Ma s terca rd's   rul es   due  to  the  di fference  i n  Emi ng  between  the  pa yment  tra ns a cEon  da te  a nd  s ubs equent  s eNlement.  For those transacEons the Company guarantees, the guarantee will cover the full amount of the seNlement obligaEon to the extent the seNlement obligaEon is not otherwise satisfied. The duration of the settlement exposure is short-term and generally limited to a few days.\n\nGross  seNlement  exposure  is  esEmated  using  the  average  daily  payment  volume  during  the  three  months  prior  to  period  end  mulEplied  by  the  esEmated number  of  days  of  exposure. The  Company  has  global  risk  management  policies  and  procedures,  which  include  risk  standards,  to  provide  a  framework  for managing the Company's seNlement risk and exposure. In the event of failed seNlement by a customer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the Company's rules to recover potential losses.

This  requirement  is  based  on  a  review  of  the  individual  risk ci rcumstances  for  each  customer. Mastercard  monitors  its  credit  risk  porSolio  and  the  adequacy  of  its  risk  miEgaEon  arrangements  on  a  regular  basis.

      "question": "How did Mastercard's implementation of its multi-layered security approach evolve from 2022 through 2024 in response to expanding real-time payment infrastructure across increasing numbers of global markets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Mastercard's multi-layered security approach was already robust, incorporating multiple layers of protection and working with issuers, acquirers, and governments to develop technical standards like EMV for secure transactions. At that time, real-time payments infrastructure was operational or being implemented in 12 of the top 50 GDP markets. By 2023, the company had expanded this to 13 markets and emphasized intelligent routing with real-time application of fraud scoring and tokenization services across a globally integrated network. In 2024, with the expansion into China through a joint venture and the ability to process domestic transactions there, the security framework had to scale further to accommodate this new market while maintaining network integrity. The multi-layered approach continued to evolve, integrating third-party service risks and public-private partnerships to address emerging threats in an increasingly real-time, cross-border payment ecosystem.",

As of December 31, 2021, we either operated or were implementing realtime payments infrastructure in 12 of the top 50 markets as measured by GDP. We also apply our real-time payments capabilities to new payment flows, such as consumer bill payments using our real-time bill pay solutions.\n\nAccount to Account. We enable consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to send and receive money directly from account to account. We apply these capabilities to help these stakeholders with various disbursements and remittances.\n\nWe discuss below under 'Our Payment Products and Applications' the ways in which we apply our real-time account-based and account to account payment capabilities to capture new payment flows.\n\n## Security and Franchise\n\nPayments System Security. We have a multi-layered approach to protect the global payments ecosystem. As part of this approach, we have a robust program to protect our network from cyber and information security threats. Our network and platforms incorporate multiple layers of protection, providing greater resiliency and best-in-class security protection. Our programs are assessed by third parties and incorporate benchmarking and other data from peer companies and consultants. We engage in many efforts to mitigate information  security  challenges,  including  maintaining  an  information  security  program,  an  enterprise  resilience  program  and insurance coverage, as well as regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. Through the combined efforts of our Security Operations Centers, Fusion Centers and the Mastercard Intelligence Center, we work with experts across the organization (as  well  as  through  other  sources  such  as  public-private  partnerships)  to  monitor  and  respond  quickly  to  a  range  of  cyber  and physical threats.\n\nAs  another  feature  of  our  multi-layered  approach  to  protect  the  global  payments  ecosystem,  we  work  with  issuers,  acquirers, merchants,  governments  and  payments  industry  associations  to  develop  and  put  in  place  technical  standards  (such  as  EMV standards for chips and smart payment cards) for safe and secure transactions and we provide solutions and products that are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments ecosystem. We discuss specific cyber and intelligence solutions that we offer to our customers in 'Our Value-Added Services'.\n\nOur Franchise. We manage an ecosystem of stakeholders that participate in our network and payments platforms. Our franchise creates and sustains a comprehensive series of value exchanges across our ecosystem. We ensure a balanced ecosystem where all participants benefit from the availability, innovation, safety and security of our network. We achieve this through the following key activities:\n\n- Participant Onboarding. We ensure the capability of new customers to use our network and define the roles and responsibilities for their operations once on the network\n- Safety and Security. We establish the core principles, including ensuring consumer protections and integrity, so participants feel confident to transact on the network\n- Operating Standards. We define the operational, technical and financial policies to which network participants are required to adhere",

By 2023, the company provided a detailed description of its settlement risk guarantee framework, noting that historically, losses from customer settlement failures had been low, and it estimated settlement exposure using average daily payment volume over the prior three months multiplied by the estimated number of days of exposure. In 2024, Mastercard maintained the same methodology for estimating settlement exposure but reiterated its cooperation with multiple regulatory investigations, including the U.S. DOJ and the European Commission, while continuing to monitor its credit risk portfolio and risk mitigation arrangements.

          "chunk_text": "## U.S. Liability Shift Litigation\n\nIn 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class acEon complaint was filed in federal court in California alleging that Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover (the  'Network  Defendants'),  EMVCo,  and  a  number  of  issuing  banks  (the  'Bank  Defendants')  engaged  in  a  conspiracy  to  shiV  fraud  liability  for  card  present tra ns a cEons   from  is s ui ng  ba nks   to  mercha nts   not  yet  i n  complia nce  with  the  s ta nda rds   for  EMV  chip  ca rds   in  the  United  Sta tes   (the  'EMV  Lia bility  ShiV'),  in vi ol a Eon  of  the  Sherma n  Act a nd  Ca lifornia  la w.  Pla inEffs  a llege da ma ges  equa l to the va lue of a ll cha rgeba cks  for which cla s s  members  beca me liable as a result of the EMV Liability ShiV on October 1, 2015. The plainEffs seek treble damages, aNorney's fees and costs and an injuncEon against future violaEons of governing  law. The  district  court  denied  the  Network  Defendants'  moEon  to  dismiss  the  complaint,  but  granted  such  a  moEon  for  EMVCo  and  the  Bank Defendants. In 2017, the district court transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. MDL LiEgaEon Cases described above. In 2020, the district court issued an order granEng the plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon. The plainEffs have submiNed expert reports that allege aggregate s i ngl e   da ma ge s   i n  e xce s s   of  $1  bi l l i on  a ga i ns t  the  four  Ne twork  De fe nda nts . The   Ne twork  De fe nda nts   s ubmi Ned  expert  reports   rebuUng  both  lia bility  a nd damages and all briefs on summary judgment have been submiNed. In September 2024, the district court denied the Network Defendants' moEon for summary judgment.\n\n## Telephone Consumer Protection Class Action\n\nMastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer ProtecEon Act ('TCPA') class acEon pending in Florida.  The plainEffs are individuals and businesses who allege  that  approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them adverEsing a Mastercard co-brand card issued by First Arkansas Bank ('FAB'). The  TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax. Mastercard has asserted various defenses to the claims, and has noEfied FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed). In 2019, the Federal CommunicaEons Commission ('FCC') issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services that are received online via email. In 2021, the trial court granted plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon, but narrowed the s cope of the class to stand alone fax recipients only. Mastercard's request to appeal that decision was denied. Briefing on plainEffs' moEon to amend the class definition and Mastercard's cross-motion to decertify the stand alone fax recipient class was completed in April 2023 and the parties await the court's decision.\n\n## U.S. Department of Justice Investigation\n\nIn  March  2023,  Mastercard  received  a  Civil  InvesEgaEve  Demand  ('CID')  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  JusEce  AnEtrust  Division  ('DOJ')  seeking  documents  and i nformaEon regarding a potenEal violaEon of SecEons 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act.  The CID focuses on Mastercard's U.S. debit program and compeEEon with other payment networks and technologies. Mastercard is cooperating with the DOJ in connection with the CID.\n\n## European Commission Investigation\n\nIn August 2024, Mastercard received a formal request for informaEon from the European Commission seeking documents and informaEon in connecEon with an i nves EgaEon into alleged anE-compeEEve behavior of certain card scheme services in the European Union/EEA.  The request focuses on Mastercard's pracEces regarding network fees related to acquirers. Mastercard is cooperating with the European Commission in connection with the request.\n\n## Note 22. Settlement and Other Risk Management\n\nMastercard's rules guarantee the seNlement of many of the payment network transacEons between its customers ('seNlement risk').  SeNlement exposure is the s e Nl e ment  ri s k  to  cus tomers   under  Ma s terca rd's   rul es   due  to  the  di fference  i n  Emi ng  between  the  pa yment  tra ns a cEon  da te  a nd  s ubs equent  s eNlement.  For those transacEons the Company guarantees, the guarantee will cover the full amount of the seNlement obligaEon to the extent the seNlement obligaEon is not otherwise satisfied. The duration of the settlement exposure is short-term and generally limited to a few days.\n\nGross  seNlement  exposure  is  esEmated  using  the  average  daily  payment  volume  during  the  three  months  prior  to  period  end  mulEplied  by  the  esEmated number  of  days  of  exposure. The  Company  has  global  risk  management  policies  and  procedures,  which  include  risk  standards,  to  provide  a  framework  for managing the Company's seNlement risk and exposure. In the event of failed seNlement by a customer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the Company's rules to recover potential losses. Historically, the Company has experienced a low level of losses from customer settlement failures.\n\nAs part of its policies, Mastercard requires certain customers that do not meet the Company's risk standards to enter into risk miEgaEon arrangements, including cash  collateral  and/or  forms  of  credit  enhancement  such  as  leNers  of  credit  and  guarantees. This  requirement  is  based  on  a  review  of  the  individual  risk ci rcumstances  for  each  customer. Mastercard  monitors  its  credit  risk  porSolio  and  the  adequacy  of  its  risk  miEgaEon  arrangements  on  a  regular  basis. AddiEonally, the  Company periodically reviews its risk management methodology and standards.  As such, the amounts of esEmated seNlement exposure are revised as necessary.",

Reinsurance (continued)\n\n## Catastrophe Coverage\n\nThe  Company  has  exposure  to  catastrophes  which  could  contribute  to  significant  fluctuations  in  the  Company's  results  of operations. For the U.S. and EMEA, the Company purchases catastrophe coverage to reinsure risks issued within territories that the Company believes are subject to the greatest catastrophic risks. For its other segments, the Company uses excess of retention and quota  share  reinsurance  agreements  to  provide  greater  diversification  of  risk  and  minimize  exposure  to  larger  risks.  Excess  of retention  reinsurance  agreements  provide  for  a  portion  of  a  risk  to  remain  with  the  direct  writing  company  and  quota  share reinsurance agreements provide for the direct writing company to transfer a fixed percentage of all risks of a class of policies.\n\n## Reinsurance Recoverables\n\nThe Company reinsures its business through a diversified group of well-capitalized reinsurers. The Company analyzes recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes, if any, with its reinsurers. The Company monitors ratings and evaluates the financial strength of its reinsurers by analyzing their financial statements. In addition, the reinsurance recoverable balance due from each reinsurer is evaluated as part of the overall monitoring process. Recoverability of reinsurance recoverable balances is evaluated based on these analyses. The Company generally secures large reinsurance recoverable balances with various forms of collateral, including secured trusts, funds withheld accounts and irrevocable letters of credit. These reinsurance recoverable balances are stated net of allowances for uncollectible reinsurance, which at December 31, 2021 and 2020, were not significant. A U.S. life insurance subsidiary  of  the  Company  also  secured  collateral  from  its  counterparties  to  mitigate  counterparty  default  risk  related  to  its longevity reinsurance agreements.\n\nThe Company has secured certain reinsurance recoverable balances with various forms of collateral, including secured trusts, funds withheld accounts and irrevocable letters of credit. The Company had $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion of unsecured reinsurance recoverable balances at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had $6.3 billion of net ceded reinsurance recoverables. Of this total, $4.1 billion, or 65%, were with the Company's five largest ceded reinsurers, including $1.9 billion of net ceded reinsurance recoverables which were unsecured. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $6.6 billion of net ceded reinsurance recoverables. Of this total, $4.2 billion, or 64%, were with the Company's five largest ceded reinsurers, including $2.0 billion of net ceded reinsurance recoverables which were unsecured.\n\nThe  Company  has  reinsured  with  an  unaffiliated  third-party  reinsurer,  59.25%  of  the  closed  block  through  a  modified coinsurance agreement. The Company accounts for this agreement under the deposit method of accounting. The Company, having the right of offset, has offset the modified coinsurance deposit with the deposit recoverable.\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife Funding raised cash through its commercial paper program to extend loans to affiliates via MetLife Credit Corp., highlighting active use of this short-term funding mechanism to support internal liquidity needs. In 2023, the company reaffirmed its use of commercial paper as part of a diversified short-term debt strategy, though no specific figures were disclosed, suggesting continued reliance but potentially more stable or internalized funding flows. By 2024, commercial paper remained a core component of short-term debt, but the emphasis on counterparties' ability to fulfill obligations indicated a cautious approach amid potential market volatility. This 3-year trend shows a consistent but increasingly risk-aware use of commercial paper, signaling a strategic balance between flexibility and market dependence.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Cash Flows from Financing\n\nThe principal cash inflows from our financing activities come from issuances of debt and other securities, deposits of funds associated with policyholder account balances and lending of securities. The principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt and the collateral financing arrangement, payments of dividends on and repurchases or redemptions of MetLife, Inc.'s securities, withdrawals associated with policyholder account balances and the return of securities on loan.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Sources\n\nIn addition to the general description of liquidity and capital sources in '- Summary of the Company's Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital,' the Company's primary sources of liquidity and capital are set forth below.\n\n## Global Funding Sources\n\nLiquidity is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including funding agreements, credit and committed facilities and commercial paper. Capital is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including short-term and long-term debt, the collateral  financing arrangement, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities. MetLife, Inc. maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that permits the issuance of public debt, equity and  hybrid  securities.  As  a  'Well-Known  Seasoned  Issuer'  under  SEC  rules,  MetLife,  Inc.'s  shelf  registration  statement provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing and has no stated issuance capacity. The diversity of our global funding sources enhances our funding flexibility,  limits  dependence  on  any  one  market  or  source  of  funds  and  generally  lowers  the  cost  of funds. Our primary global funding sources include:\n\n## Preferred Stock\n\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on preferred stock issuances.\n\n## Common Stock\n\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Commercial Paper, Reported in Short-term Debt\n\nMetLife, Inc. and MetLife Funding each have a commercial paper program that is supported by our unsecured revolving credit facility (see '- Credit and Committed Facilities'). MetLife Funding raises cash from its commercial paper program and uses the proceeds to extend loans through MetLife Credit Corp., another subsidiary of MLIC, to affiliates in order to enhance the financial flexibility and liquidity of these companies.\n\n## FHLB Advance Agreements, Reported in Liabilities Held-for-Sale\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  we  borrowed  $0  and  $2.8  billion,  respectively,  and  repaid  $700 million and $2.9 billion, respectively, under advance agreements with the FHLB of Boston. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, total obligations outstanding under these advance agreements were $0 and $700 million, respectively.\n\n## Policyholder Account Balances\n\nSee  Notes  1  and  4  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  a  description  of  the  components  of policyholder  account  balances.  See  '-  Insurance  Liabilities'  regarding  the  source  and  uncertainties  associated  with  the estimation of the contractual obligations related to future policy benefits and policyholder account balances.\n\nThe sum of the estimated cash flows of $248.6 billion ($29.5 billion of which are estimated to occur in one year or less) exceeds the liability amount of $203.5 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.\n\nThe estimated cash flows represent cash payments undiscounted as to interest and including assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and deposits; withdrawals, including unscheduled or partial withdrawals; policy lapses; surrender charges;  annuitization;  mortality;  future  interest  credited;  policy  loans  and  other  contingent  events  as  appropriate  for  the respective  product  type.  Such  estimated  cash  payments  are  also  presented  net  of  estimated  future  premiums  on  policies currently  in-force  and  gross  of  any  reinsurance  recoverable.

Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n\n## Other Invested Assets\n\nOther invested assets consist principally of the following:\n\n- Freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values which are described in '- Derivatives' below.\n- Tax credit and renewable energy partnerships which derive a significant source of investment return in the form of income tax  credits  or  other  tax  incentives.  Where  tax  credits  are  guaranteed  by  a  creditworthy  third  party,  the  investment  is accounted for under the effective yield method. Otherwise, the investment is accounted for under the equity method. See Note 19.\n- Annuities funding structured settlement claims represent annuities funding claims assumed by the Company in its capacity as  a  structured  settlements  assignment  company.  The  annuities  are  stated  at  their  contract  value,  which  represents  the present  value  of  the  future  periodic  claim  payments  to  be  provided. The  net  investment  income  recognized  reflects  the amortization of discount of the annuity at its implied effective interest rate.\n- Direct financing leases net investment is equal to the minimum lease payment receivables plus the unguaranteed residual value,  less  the  unearned  income,  less ACL.  Income  is  recognized  by  applying  the  pre-tax  internal  rate  of  return  to  the investment balance. The Company regularly reviews its minimum lease payment receivables for credit loss and residual value for impairments. Certain direct financing leases are linked to inflation.\n- Leveraged leases net investment is equal to the minimum lease payment receivables plus the unguaranteed residual value, less  the  unearned  income,  less  ACL  and  is  reported  net  of  non-recourse  debt.  Income  is  recognized  by  applying  the leveraged lease's estimated rate of return to the net investment in the lease in those periods in which the net investment at the beginning of the period is positive. Leveraged leases derive investment returns in part from their income tax benefit. The Company regularly reviews its minimum lease payment receivables for credit loss and residual value for impairments.\n- Investments in operating joint ventures that engage in insurance underwriting activities are accounted for under the equity method.\n- Investments in Federal Home Loan Bank ('FHLB') common stock are carried at redemption value and are considered restricted  investments  until  redeemed  by  the  respective  regional  FHLBs.  Dividends  are  recognized  in  net  investment income when declared.\n- Funds  withheld  represent  a  receivable  for  amounts  contractually  withheld  by  ceding  companies  in  accordance  with reinsurance agreements. The Company recognizes interest on funds withheld at rates defined by the terms of the agreement which may be contractually specified or directly related to the underlying investments.\n\n## Securities Lending Transactions and Repurchase Agreements\n\nThe Company accounts for securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements as financing arrangements and the associated  liability  is  recorded  at  the  amount  of  cash  received.  The  securities  loaned  or  sold  under  these  agreements  are included in invested assets. Income and expenses associated with securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements are recognized as investment income and investment expense, respectively, within net investment income.\n\n## Securities Lending Transactions\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  securities  lending  transactions,  whereby  securities  are  loaned  to  unaffiliated  financial institutions. The Company obtains collateral at the inception of the loan, usually cash, in an amount generally equal to 102% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, and maintains it at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the duration of the loan. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. The Company is liable to return to the counterparties the cash collateral received. Security collateral on deposit from counterparties in connection with securities lending transactions may not be sold or re-pledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not reflected on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company monitors the ratio of the collateral held to the estimated fair value of the securities loaned on a daily basis and additional collateral is obtained as necessary throughout the duration of the loan.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MetLife reported deposit assets and liabilities on reinsurance at $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, remaining unchanged from 2020 to 2021. In 2023, the company disclosed a major risk transfer transaction with Global Atlantic, under which it recorded $10.3 billion in reinsurance recoverables and deposit receivables, significantly increasing its exposure under the deposit method. By 2024, deposit assets on reinsurance had risen to $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2024, while deposit liabilities had declined slightly to $1.2 billion, indicating a post-transaction rebalancing. This trajectory reveals a strategic shift in 2023 that materially expanded the use of deposit method accounting, followed by a recalibration in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n\n## 6. Reinsurance (continued)\n\nReinsurance agreements that do not expose the Company to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk are recorded using the deposit method of accounting. The deposit assets on reinsurance were $1.8 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. The deposit liabilities on reinsurance were $1.4 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## 7. Closed Block\n\nOn April 7, 2000 (the 'Demutualization Date'), Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ('MLIC') converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. The conversion was pursuant to an order by the New York Superintendent of Insurance approving MLIC's plan of reorganization, as amended (the 'Plan of Reorganization'). On the Demutualization Date, MLIC established a closed block for the benefit of holders of certain individual life insurance policies of MLIC. Assets have been allocated to the closed block in an amount that has been determined to produce cash flows which, together with anticipated revenues from the policies included in the closed block, are reasonably expected to be sufficient to support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies, including, but not limited to, provisions for the payment of claims and certain expenses and taxes, and to provide for the continuation of policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999, if the experience underlying such dividend scales continues, and for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience changes. At least annually, the Company compares actual and projected experience against the experience assumed in the then-current dividend scales. Dividend scales are adjusted periodically to give effect to changes in experience.\n\nThe closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed block assets and the anticipated revenues from the policies in the closed block will benefit only the holders of the policies in the closed block. To the extent that, over time, cash flows from the assets allocated to the closed block and claims and other experience related to the closed block are, in the aggregate, more or less favorable than what was assumed when the closed block was established, total dividends paid to closed block policyholders in the future  may be greater than or less than the total dividends that would have been paid to these policyholders if the policyholder dividend  scales  in  effect  for  1999  had  been  continued.  Any  cash  flows  in  excess  of  amounts  assumed  will  be  available  for distribution over time to closed block policyholders and will not be available to stockholders. If the closed block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets outside of the closed block. The closed block will continue in effect as long as any policy in the closed block remains in-force. The expected life of the closed block is over 100 years from the Demutualization Date.\n\nThe Company uses the same accounting principles to account for the participating policies included in the closed block as it used prior to the Demutualization Date. However, the Company establishes a policyholder dividend obligation for earnings that will be paid to policyholders as additional dividends as described below. The excess of closed block liabilities over closed block assets at the Demutualization Date (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in AOCI) represents the estimated maximum future earnings from the closed block expected to result from operations, attributed net of income tax, to the closed block. Earnings of the closed block are recognized in income over the period the policies and contracts in the closed block remain in-force. Management believes  that  over  time  the  actual  cumulative  earnings  of  the  closed  block  will  approximately  equal  the  expected  cumulative earnings  due  to  the  effect  of  dividend  changes.  If,  over  the  period  the  closed  block  remains  in  existence,  the  actual  cumulative earnings of the closed block are greater than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block, the Company will pay the excess to  closed  block  policyholders  as  additional  policyholder  dividends  unless  offset  by  future  unfavorable  experience  of  the  closed block and, accordingly, will recognize only the expected cumulative earnings in income with the excess recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. If over such period, the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block are less than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block, the Company will recognize only the actual earnings in income. However, the Company may change policyholder dividend scales in the future, which would be intended to increase future actual earnings until the actual cumulative earnings equal the expected cumulative earnings.\n\nExperience within the closed block, in particular mortality and investment yields, as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses, directly impact the policyholder dividend obligation. Amortization of the closed block DAC, which resides outside of the closed  block,  is  based  upon  cumulative  actual  and  expected  earnings  within  the  closed  block. Accordingly,  the  Company's  net income continues to be sensitive to the actual performance of the closed block.\n\nClosed block assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are combined on a line-by-line basis with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses outside the closed block based on the nature of the particular item.",

Also, included in other liabilities in the table above are deposit liabilities on reinsurance of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nIn November 2023, the Company completed a risk transfer transaction with subsidiaries of G lobal Atlantic Financial G roup ('G lobal Atlantic'), a retirement and life insurance company, to reinsure an in-force block of universal life, variable universal life, universal life with secondary guarantees, and fix ed annuities, which are reported in the MetLife Holdings segment. The Company entered into reinsurance agreements on a coinsurance basis for the general account products and on a modified coinsurance basis  for  the  separate  account  products.  The  Company  recorded  reinsurance  recoverables  and  deposit  receivables  of  $10.3  billion  at  December  31,  2023  reported  in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables. At inception of the agreement, in addition to recording the amount recoverable, the Company (i) transferred to the reinsurer $9.5 billion of assets primarily consisting of fix ed maturity securities AFS and mortgage loans supporting the general account liabilities reduced by a $2.2 billion pre-tax ceding commission, (ii) retained $5.0 billion separate account assets under the modified coinsurance arrangement and (iii) recorded the net cost of reinsurance of $770 million within other liabilities, related to universal life, variable universal life and universal life with secondary guarantees reinsured. The net cost of reinsurance will be amortized on a basis consistent with the methodologies and assumptions used for amortizing DAC related to the underlying reinsured contracts in policyholder benefits and claims.\n\nAs part of this transaction, the Company's institutional investment management business entered into investment advisory and other agreements with subsidiaries of Global Atlantic to serve as the investment manager for certain of the transferred general account assets.

In 2022, internally developed designations were applied to newly acquired securities until NAIC designations became available, reflecting a process unchanged in 2023 and 2024.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nNAIC designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS are based on a modeling methodology that estimates security level expected losses under a variety of economic scenarios. Prior to December 31, 2021, the modeling methodology incorporated the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) without regard to the issuance date. As of December 31, 2021, the modeling methodology for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued prior to January 1, 2013 incorporates the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) and the likelihood of recovery of the amortized  cost;  while  for  non-agency  RMBS  and  CMBS  issued  after  January  1,  2013,  the  modeling  methodology  does  not incorporate the amortized cost of the security. The NAIC's objective with the modeling methodology is to increase accuracy in estimating expected losses, and to use the improved assessment to determine an appropriate RBC charge for non-agency RMBS and CMBS. We utilize these NAIC designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries that maintain the NAIC statutory basis of accounting. The NAIC evaluates non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by insurers on an annual basis. When MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries acquire non-agency RMBS and CMBS that have not been previously evaluated by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used until a NAIC designation becomes available.\n\nEffective  December  31,  2020,  the  NAIC  implemented  20  'NAIC  designation  categories'  which  is  an  additional,  more granular  credit  quality  categorization.  These  NAIC  designation  categories  correspond  more  closely  to  the  NRSRO's  alphanumeric credit quality ratings. Effective December 31, 2021, the NAIC implemented new unique RBC factors for each of the 20 NAIC designation categories. The NAIC's goal is to better align RBC charges on securities with the instruments' actual credit risk.\n\nRating agency ratings are based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the NAIC credit rating provider list, including Moody's Investors Service ('Moody's'), S&amp;P, Fitch Ratings ('Fitch'), DBRS Morningstar, A.M. Best Company ('A.M. Best'), Kroll Bond Rating Agency and Egan Jones Ratings Company. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.\n\nThe following table presents total fixed maturity securities AFS by NRSRO rating and the applicable NAIC designation from the NAIC published comparison of NRSRO ratings to NAIC designations, except for non-agency RMBS and CMBS, held by MetLife,  Inc.'s  insurance  subsidiaries  that  maintain  the  NAIC  statutory  basis  of  accounting,  which  are  presented  using  NAIC designations for modeled securities. NRSRO ratings and NAIC designations are as of the dates shown below. Over time, credit ratings can migrate, up or down, through the NRSRO's and NAIC's continuous monitoring process.\n\n",

During the year ended December 31, 2024, Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS increased by $1.6 billion, or 4.9%. The increase was driven by purchases in excess of sales, partially offset by transfers out of Level 3 in ex cess of transfers into Level 3 and a decrease in estimated fair value recognized in OCI.\n\n## Fixed Maturity Securities AFS Credit Quality - Ratings\n\nThe Securities V aluation Office of the NAIC evaluates the fixed maturity securities of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes. The NAIC assigns securities  to  one  of  six   credit  quality  categories  defined  as  'NAIC  designations.'  In  general,  securities  with  NAIC  designations  of  1  and  2  are  considered investment grade and securities with NAIC designations of 3 through 6 are considered below investment grade. If no NAIC designation is available, then, as permitted by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used.\n\nNAIC designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS are based on a modeling methodology that estimates security level expected losses under a variety of economic scenarios. The modeling methodology for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued prior to January 1, 2013 incorporates the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) and the likelihood of recovery of the amortized cost; while for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued after January 1, 2013, the modeling  methodology  does  not  incorporate  the  amortized  cost  of  the  security.  The  NAIC's  objective  with  the  modeling  methodology  is  to  increase  accuracy  in estimating expected losses and recovery value, and to use this credit quality assessment to determine an appropriate RBC charge for non-agency RMBS and CMBS. We utilize these NAIC designations for our non-agency RMBS and CMBS in our disclosures below. The NAIC evaluates non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by insurers on an annual basis.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, BNY Mellon consistently highlighted that its ability to return capital to shareholders was subject to U.S. banking laws and regulations governing capital adequacy. In 2022, the company emphasized general regulatory oversight and its impact on business operations. By 2023, it specifically reiterated that shareholder returns could be limited by U.S. banking laws, Delaware law, and the failure to pay full and timely dividends on preferred stock. In 2024, the language remained largely consistent with 2023, but the company added a stronger emphasis on liquidity management and the potential consequences of failing to meet regulatory standards such as 'well capitalized' and 'well managed' status.

However, the surrounding context and formatting of the disclosure remained largely unchanged across the years, suggesting that BK maintained a stable approach to audit governance and did not introduce new emphasis or structural changes in how it presented its relationship with KPMG LLP.

In 2023, the company introduced the 'Form of Long-Term Incentive Plan Deferred Stock Unit Agreement for Directors,' extending the plan\u2019s application to director-level compensation. By 2024, the company continued building on the 2019 plan by incorporating newer forms such as the 2022 Form of Performance Share Unit Agreement, showing a sustained and expanding reliance on the plan as a foundational framework for long-term compensation design.

      "question": "How did PayPal's exposure to abusive behaviors evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to its credit products and third-party fraud schemes, and what does this progression indicate about the growing complexity of risk management in its digital payments ecosystem?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PayPal's exposure to abusive behaviors increased in complexity and scope, particularly in relation to its credit products and third-party fraud schemes. In 2022, PayPal highlighted the risk of fraud through fictitious account creation, stolen financial instruments, and abusive schemes that were difficult to detect due to the digital nature of its services. By 2023, the company expanded on this risk by entering a multi-year agreement to sell up to \u20ac40 billion of U.K. and European BNPL loan receivables, which introduced new exposure to third-party fraud in large-scale loan portfolios. In 2024, PayPal further detailed the evolving tactics of fraudsters, including account takeovers and synthetic identity fraud, while also facing legal uncertainty around the validity of loan receivables purchased from FDIC-insured banks. This 3-year progression shows an increasing sophistication in abusive behaviors, requiring PayPal to continuously enhance its detection systems and risk mitigation strategies across a more complex and globalized payments ecosystem.",

If  we  are  unable  to  fund  our  credit products, or the purchase of the receivables related to our merchant financing offerings in the U.S. adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, the growth of our credit products could be negatively impacted.\n\nFor information on lending regulations that impact our business, see ' Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business -Lending Regulation ' in this risk factor section.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to: networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to  originate  our  U.S.  credit  products  to  consumers,  U.S.  merchant  financing,  and  branded  credit  card  products;  PayPalbranded  debit  card  products  issued  by  an  unaffiliated  bank;  cryptocurrency  custodial  service  providers;  and  external  business partners  and  contractors  who  provide  key  functions  (e.g.,  outsourced  customer  support  and  product  development  functions; facilities;  information  technology,  data  center  facilities  and  cloud  computing). These  risks  include  legal,  regulatory,  information security,  reputational,  operational,  or  any  other  risks  inherent  in  engaging  and  relying  upon  a  third-party.  If  we  are  unable  to effectively  manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, or we experience substantial  disruptions  in  these  relationships,  our  operations,  results  of  operations,  and  financial  results  could  be  adversely impacted. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree  of  control  over  business  operations,  governance,  and  compliance,  thereby  potentially  increasing  our  financial,  legal, reputational, and operational risk.\n\n## Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\n\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that  take  place  within  a  single  country  or  market.  In  certain  markets,  cross-border  trade  represents  our  primary  (and  in  some instances our only) presence.\n\nCross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical, such as trade policy, higher tariffs, or localization requirements, could reduce our crossborder transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business.\n\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.\n\nThird parties have attempted, and we expect that they will likely continue to attempt, to abuse access to and misuse our payment services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information,  making  transactions  with  stolen  financial  instruments,  abusing  or  misusing  our  services  for  financial  gain,  or fraudulently  inducing  users  of  our  systems  into  engaging  in  bad  transactions.  Due  to  the  nature  of  PayPal's  digital  payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical transactions. Measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud and abusive behavior are complex, require continuous improvement, and may not be effective in detecting and preventing",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDeposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC') approved a final rule clarifying that loans validly originated by state-chartered banks or insured branches of foreign banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan, reflecting a similar rule finalized by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency ('OCC') in May 2020 for nationally chartered banks. The final rule reaffirms and codifies the so-called 'valid-when-made doctrine,' which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC and PPBL products, certain installment products, and our business.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement to sell U.K. and European buy now, pay later ('BNPL') loan receivables originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., consisting of the sale of a substantial majority of the U.K. and European BNPL loan portfolio held on PayPal (Europe)'s balance sheet at the closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans. The sale of future eligible receivables is subject to certain conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived or if the parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under these arrangements, the sale of these receivables could be delayed and we may not realize the expected benefits of this arrangement.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the  payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate our  U.S. credit products to consumers,  U.S. merchant financing, and branded credit card products; branded debit card and savings products issued by unaffiliated banks; cryptocurrency custodial service providers; and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions (including, but not limited to, data center facilities and cloud computing, information technology, and outsourced customer support and product development functions). We are subject to additional risks inherent in engaging and relying upon third-party providers, including operational, legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, commercial, and resiliency risks. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, we are overly reliant on certain relationships, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships (including interruptions to the availability of our products and services), our operations, results of operations, and financial results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our relationships with third parties inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance, and compliance, which potentially increases our financial, legal, reputational, and operational risk.\n\n## Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\n\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits.

      "question": "How did PayPal's exposure to margin risk evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to its transaction pricing strategy, use of payment processors, and revenue incentives, and what does this multi-year trend reveal about the company's control over pricing and cost management?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PayPal consistently bore full margin risk when completing payment transactions, indicating a stable strategic stance on pricing control despite evolving incentives and cost structures. In 2022, PayPal emphasized its discretion in setting fees independent of costs incurred through payment processors, which were recognized as transaction expenses. In 2023, the company expanded its discussion on incentives to merchants and consumers, including discounts, rebates, and rewards, which were recognized as reductions to revenue, adding complexity to margin management. By 2024, PayPal maintained its stance on bearing full margin risk and further detailed its transaction revenues, including contractual compensation from sellers violating terms (e.g., fraud or counterfeiting), which introduced new revenue streams potentially affecting margin dynamics. Despite these evolving factors, PayPal's consistent recognition of transaction processor fees as expenses and its control over pricing decisions across all three years suggests a disciplined, centralized approach to margin risk management.",

          "chunk_text": "## PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n\n## Recent accounting guidance\n\nIn  2020,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ('FASB')  issued  ASU  2020-04, Reference  Rate  Reform (Topic  848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . This amended guidance provides transition relief for the accounting impact of reference rate reform. For a limited period, this guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying  GAAP  to  certain  contract  modifications,  hedging  relationships,  and  other  transactions  affected  by  a  reference  rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. The amended guidance is effective through December 31, 2022. Our exposure to London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') is primarily limited to an insignificant portion of our available-for-sale debt securities  and,  accordingly,  we  do  not  expect  reference  rate  reform  to  have  a  material  impact  on  our  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 2-REVENUE\n\nWe enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers  on  our  payments  platform  and  from  other  value  added  services.  Our  revenues  are  classified  into  two  categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services.\n\n## TRANSACTION REVENUES\n\nWe earn transaction revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers to receive payments on our platform. These fees may have a  fixed  and  variable  component. The  variable  component  is  generally  a  percentage  of  the  value  of  the  payment  amount  and  is known at the time the transaction is processed. For a portion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement  when  the  underlying  transaction  is  approved  for  a  refund.  We  estimate  the  amount  of  fee  refunds  that  will  be processed each quarter and record a provision against our transaction revenues. The volume of activity processed on our payments platform,  which  results  in  transaction  revenue,  is  referred  to  as  Total  Payment  V olume  ('TPV').  We  earn  additional  fees  on transactions  where  we  perform  currency  conversion,  when  we  enable  cross-border  transactions  (i.e.,  transactions  where  the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, and other miscellaneous fees. Our transaction revenues are also reduced by certain incentives provided to our customers.\n\nOur contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the notice period has lapsed. Therefore, our contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already  provided.  Our  contracts  generally  renew  automatically  without  any  significant  material  rights.  Some  of  our  contracts include tiered pricing, which are based primarily on volume. The fee charged per transaction is adjusted up or down if the volume processed for a specified period is different from prior period defined volumes. We have concluded that this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future material right since the discount is within a range typically offered to a class of customers with similar volume. We do not have any capitalized contract costs and we do not carry any material contract balances.\n\nOur primary service comprises a single performance obligation to complete payments on our payments platform for our customers. Using  our  risk  assessment  tools,  we  perform  a  transaction  risk  assessment  on  individual  transactions  to  determine  whether  a transaction should be authorized for completion on our payments platform. When we authorize a transaction, we become obligated to our customer to complete the payment transaction.\n\nWe recognize fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of  completing  a  payment  transaction. As  a  principal  to  the  transaction,  we  control  the  service  of  completing  payments  on  our payments platform. We bear primary responsibility for the fulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with our customers, control the product specifications, and define the value proposal from our services. Further, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances where we may utilize payment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment transaction. These fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing customer support.",

The  amended  guidance requires incremental reportable segment disclosures, primarily about significant segment expenses. The amendments also require entities with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by these amendments, and all existing segment disclosures. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.  We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2024.  For additional information, see 'Note 18-Segment Information.'\n\nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these new accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 2-REVENUE\n\nWe enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers on our payments platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into two categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services.\n\n## TRANSACTION REVENUES\n\nWe earn transaction revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers to receive payments on our platform. These fees may have a fixed and variable component. The variable component is generally a percentage of the value of the payment amount and is known at the time the transaction is processed. For a portion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement when the underlying transaction is approved for a refund. We estimate the amount of fee refunds that will be processed each quarter and record a provision against our transaction revenues. The volume of activity processed on our payments platform, which  results  in  transaction  revenue,  is  referred  to  as  Total  Payment  V olume  ('TPV ').  We  generate  additional  revenues  from  merchants  and  consumers:  on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or V enmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees. Our transaction revenues are also reduced by certain incentives provided to our customers.\n\nOur contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the notice period has lapsed. Therefore, our contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already provided. Our contracts generally renew automatically without any significant material rights. Some of our contracts include tiered pricing, which are based primarily on volume. The fee charged per transaction is adjusted up or down if the volume processed for a specified period is different from prior period defined volumes.  We have concluded that this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future material right since the discount is within a range typically offered to a class of customers with similar volume. We do not have any capitalized contract costs.\n\nOur primary service comprises a single performance obligation to complete payments on our payments platform for our customers. Using our risk assessment tools, we perform a transaction risk assessment on individual transactions to determine whether a transaction should be authorized for completion on our payments platform. When we authorize a transaction, we become obligated to our customer to complete the payment transaction.\n\nWe recognize fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of completing a payment transaction. As a principal to the transaction, we control the service of completing payments on our payments platform. We bear primary responsibility for the fulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with our customers, control the product specifications, and define the value proposal from our services. Further, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances where we may utilize payment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment transaction. These fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing customer support.",

      "question": "How did PYPL's exposure to its fixed-rate 2.850% notes evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about its long-term debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "PYPL's exposure to the fixed-rate 2.850% notes remained constant at $1.5 billion from 2022 through 2024, indicating a consistent long-term liability with no principal repayments or retirements over the period. This stability suggests that PYPL maintained its long-term debt structure without altering the principal amount of this specific note, even as it issued new debt and refinanced other tranches. The lack of change in this liability contrasts with PYPL's active debt management in other areas, such as the retirement of its 1.350% notes by 2023 and the introduction of new high-interest notes in 2024.",

      "question": "How did PayPal's exposure to bad transactions risk evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to its credit products, cross-border trade, and third-party dependencies, and what does this multi-year trend reveal about the company's risk management strategy and operational resilience?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal highlighted risks around bad transactions tied to credit defaults, particularly in its U.S. consumer credit product through Synchrony Bank, and emphasized concerns about fraud and synthetic identities. In 2023, the company entered a multi-year agreement to sell up to \u20ac40 billion of U.K. and European BNPL loan receivables, signaling a strategic shift to reduce balance sheet exposure to bad transactions in its credit portfolio. By 2024, PayPal continued to emphasize fraud and abuse risks, particularly in digital payments, while also noting legal uncertainty around the 'valid-when-made' doctrine for purchased loan receivables, which could impact U.S. credit products. The trend shows a transformation from internal risk absorption to external risk mitigation through asset sales and legal contingency planning, indicating a more proactive and diversified risk management approach over time.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nobligations and require us to change our business practices.\n\nWe are subject to the risk that account holders who use our credit products will default on their payment obligations, creating the risk  of  potential  charge-offs  or  negative  impact  to  revenue  share  arrangement  with  Synchrony  Bank  with  respect  to  our  U.S. consumer  credit  product.  The  non-payment  rate  among  account  holders  may  increase  due  to,  among  other  factors,  changes  to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a user, worsening economic conditions, such as  a  recession  or  government  austerity  programs,  increases  in  prevailing  interest  rates,  and  high  unemployment  rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our PayPal branded merchant financing offerings in the U.S. and extend credit for our consumer  and  merchants  products  outside  the  U.S.  through  our  international  subsidiaries.  If  we  are  unable  to  fund  our  credit products, or the purchase of the receivables related to our merchant financing offerings in the U.S. adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, the growth of our credit products could be negatively impacted.\n\nFor information on lending regulations that impact our business, see ' Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business -Lending Regulation ' in this risk factor section.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to: networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to  originate  our  U.S.  credit  products  to  consumers,  U.S.  merchant  financing,  and  branded  credit  card  products;  PayPalbranded  debit  card  products  issued  by  an  unaffiliated  bank;  cryptocurrency  custodial  service  providers;  and  external  business partners  and  contractors  who  provide  key  functions  (e.g.,  outsourced  customer  support  and  product  development  functions; facilities;  information  technology,  data  center  facilities  and  cloud  computing). These  risks  include  legal,  regulatory,  information security,  reputational,  operational,  or  any  other  risks  inherent  in  engaging  and  relying  upon  a  third-party.  If  we  are  unable  to effectively  manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, or we experience substantial  disruptions  in  these  relationships,  our  operations,  results  of  operations,  and  financial  results  could  be  adversely impacted. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree  of  control  over  business  operations,  governance,  and  compliance,  thereby  potentially  increasing  our  financial,  legal, reputational, and operational risk.\n\n## Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\n\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that  take  place  within  a  single  country  or  market.  In  certain  markets,  cross-border  trade  represents  our  primary  (and  in  some instances our only) presence.\n\nCross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical, such as trade policy, higher tariffs, or localization requirements, could reduce our crossborder transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business.\n\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.\n\nThird parties have attempted, and we expect that they will likely continue to attempt, to abuse access to and misuse our payment services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information,  making  transactions  with  stolen  financial  instruments,  abusing  or  misusing  our  services  for  financial  gain,  or fraudulently  inducing  users  of  our  systems  into  engaging  in  bad  transactions.  Due  to  the  nature  of  PayPal's  digital  payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical transactions. Measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud and abusive behavior are complex, require continuous improvement, and may not be effective in detecting and preventing",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDeposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC') approved a final rule clarifying that loans validly originated by state-chartered banks or insured branches of foreign banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan, reflecting a similar rule finalized by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency ('OCC') in May 2020 for nationally chartered banks. The final rule reaffirms and codifies the so-called 'valid-when-made doctrine,' which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC and PPBL products, certain installment products, and our business.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement to sell U.K. and European buy now, pay later ('BNPL') loan receivables originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., consisting of the sale of a substantial majority of the U.K. and European BNPL loan portfolio held on PayPal (Europe)'s balance sheet at the closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans. The sale of future eligible receivables is subject to certain conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived or if the parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under these arrangements, the sale of these receivables could be delayed and we may not realize the expected benefits of this arrangement.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the  payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate our  U.S. credit products to consumers,  U.S. merchant financing, and branded credit card products; branded debit card and savings products issued by unaffiliated banks; cryptocurrency custodial service providers; and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions (including, but not limited to, data center facilities and cloud computing, information technology, and outsourced customer support and product development functions). We are subject to additional risks inherent in engaging and relying upon third-party providers, including operational, legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, commercial, and resiliency risks. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, we are overly reliant on certain relationships, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships (including interruptions to the availability of our products and services), our operations, results of operations, and financial results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our relationships with third parties inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance, and compliance, which potentially increases our financial, legal, reputational, and operational risk.\n\n## Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\n\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. In certain markets, cross-border trade represents our primary (and in some instances our only) offerings.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PayPal's focus on seamless checkout experiences matured significantly. In 2022, the company emphasized expanding its global capabilities and increasing customer use of its products, including creating seamless checkout experiences and supporting transactions in over 100 currencies. By 2023, PayPal had expanded currency support to approximately 150 and highlighted the importance of simplifying shopping experiences through platform enhancements and security measures. In 2024, the company deepened integration by embedding buy now, pay later (BNPL) solutions into its branded checkout experiences and offering PayPal- and Venmo-branded debit and credit cards, while also providing omnichannel merchant solutions through Zettle and unbranded payment processors like Braintree. This evolution reflects a strategic shift from global scale and usability to enhanced financial services integration and comprehensive merchant enablement.",

Our goal is to create the simplest checkout experience possible for consumers online or offline, including mobile. We drive increased consumer engagement by providing consumers with a wide range of services to manage their finances and enhance their ability to shop online and offline. Our PayPal and V enmo branded checkout experiences allow customers to complete purchases in just a few steps without having to enter payment and address information. We also focus on simplifying and personalizing shopping experiences for our consumers by offering tools for product discovery, price tracking, saving through deals and offers, convenient package tracking, and redemption of shopping rewards. Our PayPal- and V enmo-branded debit and credit cards give consumers the ability to transact in-person through our platform and earn incentives, including cash-back rewards.\n\nWe also offer consumers person-to-person ('P2P') payment solutions for domestic and international transfers through our PayPal, V enmo, and Xoom products and services. Our V enmo digital wallet in the United States ('U.S.') is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers. Our Xoom international money transfer service enables our customers to send money to people around the world in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way. P2P is an important source of customer engagement and also serves as a customer acquisition channel that facilitates organic growth by enabling potential users to establish active accounts with PayPal or Venmo at the time they make or receive a P2P payment.\n\nWe offer credit products to eligible consumers in certain markets as a funding source at checkout. Our consumer credit offerings include our buy now, pay later products in the U.S., United Kingdom ('U.K.'), France, and G ermany, among other markets, and in Japan through our Paidy brand. A key attribute of our buy now, pay later products is the absence of interest or consumer late fees for missed payments in most of the geographies where we offer them. Further, we offer interestbearing installment products for consumers in the U.S. (issued by an independent chartered financial institution) and in G ermany. In the U.S., consumers may apply for our PayPal- and V enmo-branded consumer credit cards and our PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product, which are offered through a partnership with an independent chartered financial institution. We offer a PayPal-issued PayPal Credit product in the U.K. We believe that our consumer credit products help us to increase engagement with consumers and merchants on our two-sided network.\n\nWe generate revenue from consumers from: foreign currency conversions, instant transfers from their PayPal or V enmo account to their bank account or debit card, and facilitating the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies; interest, fees, or other revenue from our credit products; and other miscellaneous fees. We also earn revenue from interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\n\n## Merchant value proposition\n\nMerchants use our solutions to increase conversion rates and grow and manage their business. We employ a technology and platform agnostic approach intended to enable merchants of all sizes to utilize our various products. Our diversified suite of products and services is tailored to meet the needs of merchants regardless of their size or business complexity. We offer a seamless omnichannel solution that helps merchants manage and grow their business.\n\nOur PayPal and V enmo branded checkout experiences allow customers to complete purchases in just a few steps without having to enter payment and address information. These seamless experiences reduce cart abandonment and drive higher conversion rates for merchants. Our buy now, pay later solutions are embedded into our branded checkout experiences, which can help increase consumer spend and enable merchants to grow sales.\n\nOur unbranded payments processing solutions, which includes Braintree and PayPal Complete Payments, allow merchants to quickly and easily provide digital checkout online with a variety of popular ways to pay, including debit and credit cards, digital wallets, PayPal Pay Later, and local payment methods.\n\nWe offer a suite of value added services, including payouts, payments orchestration, and fraud prevention and risk management solutions that help reduce merchant losses through proprietary protection programs. We also offer omnichannel solutions that allow merchants to make sales in person using our Zettle by PayPal app, card reader, or point of sale systems.\n\n6",

      "question": "How did MetLife's use of the modified coinsurance agreement evolve from 2022 to 2024 in terms of the percentage of the closed block reinsured and the accounting treatment, and what does this consistency or change reveal about its long-term risk transfer strategy?",
      "answer": "MetLife consistently reinsured approximately 59% of the closed block through a modified coinsurance agreement across all three years (59.25% in 2022, 59% in 2023, and 59% in 2024). The company maintained the same accounting treatment throughout the period, applying the deposit method of accounting and exercising the right of offset between the modified coinsurance deposit liability and the deposit recoverable. This consistent approach indicates a stable long-term risk transfer strategy centered on managing longevity risk through a structured reinsurance arrangement with an unaffiliated third-party reinsurer.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Cash Flows from Financing\n\nThe principal cash inflows from our financing activities come from issuances of debt and other securities, deposits of funds associated with policyholder account balances and lending of securities. The principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt and the collateral financing arrangement, payments of dividends on and repurchases or redemptions of MetLife, Inc.'s securities, withdrawals associated with policyholder account balances and the return of securities on loan.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Sources\n\nIn addition to the general description of liquidity and capital sources in '- Summary of the Company's Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital,' the Company's primary sources of liquidity and capital are set forth below.\n\n## Global Funding Sources\n\nLiquidity is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including funding agreements, credit and committed facilities and commercial paper. Capital is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including short-term and long-term debt, the collateral  financing arrangement, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities. MetLife, Inc. maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that permits the issuance of public debt, equity and  hybrid  securities.  As  a  'Well-Known  Seasoned  Issuer'  under  SEC  rules,  MetLife,  Inc.'s  shelf  registration  statement provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing and has no stated issuance capacity. The diversity of our global funding sources enhances our funding flexibility,  limits  dependence  on  any  one  market  or  source  of  funds  and  generally  lowers  the  cost  of funds. Our primary global funding sources include:\n\n## Preferred Stock\n\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on preferred stock issuances.\n\n## Common Stock\n\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Commercial Paper, Reported in Short-term Debt\n\nMetLife, Inc. and MetLife Funding each have a commercial paper program that is supported by our unsecured revolving credit facility (see '- Credit and Committed Facilities'). MetLife Funding raises cash from its commercial paper program and uses the proceeds to extend loans through MetLife Credit Corp., another subsidiary of MLIC, to affiliates in order to enhance the financial flexibility and liquidity of these companies.\n\n## FHLB Advance Agreements, Reported in Liabilities Held-for-Sale\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  we  borrowed  $0  and  $2.8  billion,  respectively,  and  repaid  $700 million and $2.9 billion, respectively, under advance agreements with the FHLB of Boston. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, total obligations outstanding under these advance agreements were $0 and $700 million, respectively.\n\n## Policyholder Account Balances\n\nSee  Notes  1  and  4  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  a  description  of  the  components  of policyholder  account  balances.  See  '-  Insurance  Liabilities'  regarding  the  source  and  uncertainties  associated  with  the estimation of the contractual obligations related to future policy benefits and policyholder account balances.\n\nThe sum of the estimated cash flows of $248.6 billion ($29.5 billion of which are estimated to occur in one year or less) exceeds the liability amount of $203.5 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.\n\nThe estimated cash flows represent cash payments undiscounted as to interest and including assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and deposits; withdrawals, including unscheduled or partial withdrawals; policy lapses; surrender charges;  annuitization;  mortality;  future  interest  credited;  policy  loans  and  other  contingent  events  as  appropriate  for  the respective  product  type.  Such  estimated  cash  payments  are  also  presented  net  of  estimated  future  premiums  on  policies currently  in-force  and  gross  of  any  reinsurance  recoverable.  For  obligations  denominated  in  foreign  currencies,  cash payments have been estimated using current spot foreign currency rates.",

      "answer": "MetLife's investment in operating joint ventures declined from $77 million in 2022 to $51 million in 2023, and then increased sharply to $175 million in 2024. This pattern indicates a significant reversal in strategy or valuation dynamics in 2024 after a two-year decline, suggesting a renewed emphasis or revaluation of these equity method investments in the context of the company's broader investment portfolio.",

Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n\n## Other Invested Assets\n\nOther invested assets consist principally of the following:\n\n- Freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values which are described in '- Derivatives' below.\n- Tax credit and renewable energy partnerships which derive a significant source of investment return in the form of income tax  credits  or  other  tax  incentives.  Where  tax  credits  are  guaranteed  by  a  creditworthy  third  party,  the  investment  is accounted for under the effective yield method. Otherwise, the investment is accounted for under the equity method. See Note 19.\n- Annuities funding structured settlement claims represent annuities funding claims assumed by the Company in its capacity as  a  structured  settlements  assignment  company.  The  annuities  are  stated  at  their  contract  value,  which  represents  the present  value  of  the  future  periodic  claim  payments  to  be  provided. The  net  investment  income  recognized  reflects  the amortization of discount of the annuity at its implied effective interest rate.\n- Direct financing leases net investment is equal to the minimum lease payment receivables plus the unguaranteed residual value,  less  the  unearned  income,  less ACL.  Income  is  recognized  by  applying  the  pre-tax  internal  rate  of  return  to  the investment balance. The Company regularly reviews its minimum lease payment receivables for credit loss and residual value for impairments. Certain direct financing leases are linked to inflation.\n- Leveraged leases net investment is equal to the minimum lease payment receivables plus the unguaranteed residual value, less  the  unearned  income,  less  ACL  and  is  reported  net  of  non-recourse  debt.  Income  is  recognized  by  applying  the leveraged lease's estimated rate of return to the net investment in the lease in those periods in which the net investment at the beginning of the period is positive. Leveraged leases derive investment returns in part from their income tax benefit. The Company regularly reviews its minimum lease payment receivables for credit loss and residual value for impairments.\n- Investments in operating joint ventures that engage in insurance underwriting activities are accounted for under the equity method.\n- Investments in Federal Home Loan Bank ('FHLB') common stock are carried at redemption value and are considered restricted  investments  until  redeemed  by  the  respective  regional  FHLBs.  Dividends  are  recognized  in  net  investment income when declared.\n- Funds  withheld  represent  a  receivable  for  amounts  contractually  withheld  by  ceding  companies  in  accordance  with reinsurance agreements. The Company recognizes interest on funds withheld at rates defined by the terms of the agreement which may be contractually specified or directly related to the underlying investments.\n\n## Securities Lending Transactions and Repurchase Agreements\n\nThe Company accounts for securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements as financing arrangements and the associated  liability  is  recorded  at  the  amount  of  cash  received.  The  securities  loaned  or  sold  under  these  agreements  are included in invested assets. Income and expenses associated with securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements are recognized as investment income and investment expense, respectively, within net investment income.\n\n## Securities Lending Transactions\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  securities  lending  transactions,  whereby  securities  are  loaned  to  unaffiliated  financial institutions. The Company obtains collateral at the inception of the loan, usually cash, in an amount generally equal to 102% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, and maintains it at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the duration of the loan. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. The Company is liable to return to the counterparties the cash collateral received. Security collateral on deposit from counterparties in connection with securities lending transactions may not be sold or re-pledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not reflected on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company monitors the ratio of the collateral held to the estimated fair value of the securities loaned on a daily basis and additional collateral is obtained as necessary throughout the duration of the loan.",

      "question": "How did MetLife's use of the deposit method of accounting for reinsurance agreements evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of deposit assets and liabilities, and what does this trend indicate about the company's reinsurance strategy?",
      "answer": "MetLife's use of the deposit method of accounting for reinsurance agreements showed a clear upward trend in both deposit assets and liabilities from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, deposit assets on reinsurance were $1.8 billion, increasing to $5.1 billion by the end of 2024. Similarly, deposit liabilities rose from $1.4 billion in 2022 to $1.3 billion in 2023, and then to $1.2 billion in 2024, indicating a slight decline in liabilities in the final year. This increase in deposit assets suggests that MetLife engaged in more reinsurance agreements that did not expose the company to a significant loss from insurance risk, particularly in 2023 with the Global Atlantic transaction involving $10.3 billion in reinsurance recoverables. The trend reflects a strategic shift toward managing risk exposure through reinsurance structures that align with the deposit method, while maintaining a relatively stable liability position despite the increased asset transfers.",

Included in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables in the table above are deposit assets on reinsurance of $4.6 billion and $5.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Also, included in other liabilities in the table above are deposit liabilities on reinsurance of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nIn November 2023, the Company completed a risk transfer transaction with subsidiaries of G lobal Atlantic Financial G roup ('G lobal Atlantic'), a retirement and life insurance company, to reinsure an in-force block of universal life, variable universal life, universal life with secondary guarantees, and fix ed annuities, which are reported in the MetLife Holdings segment. The Company entered into reinsurance agreements on a coinsurance basis for the general account products and on a modified coinsurance basis  for  the  separate  account  products.

At inception of the agreement, in addition to recording the amount recoverable, the Company (i) transferred to the reinsurer $9.5 billion of assets primarily consisting of fix ed maturity securities AFS and mortgage loans supporting the general account liabilities reduced by a $2.2 billion pre-tax ceding commission, (ii) retained $5.0 billion separate account assets under the modified coinsurance arrangement and (iii) recorded the net cost of reinsurance of $770 million within other liabilities, related to universal life, variable universal life and universal life with secondary guarantees reinsured. The net cost of reinsurance will be amortized on a basis consistent with the methodologies and assumptions used for amortizing DAC related to the underlying reinsured contracts in policyholder benefits and claims.\n\nAs part of this transaction, the Company's institutional investment management business entered into investment advisory and other agreements with subsidiaries of Global Atlantic to serve as the investment manager for certain of the transferred general account assets.

Reinsurance (continued)\n\nReinsurance agreements that do not expose the Company to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk are recorded using the deposit method of accounting. The deposit assets on reinsurance were $1.8 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. The deposit liabilities on reinsurance were $1.4 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## 7. Closed Block\n\nOn April 7, 2000 (the 'Demutualization Date'), Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ('MLIC') converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. The conversion was pursuant to an order by the New York Superintendent of Insurance approving MLIC's plan of reorganization, as amended (the 'Plan of Reorganization'). On the Demutualization Date, MLIC established a closed block for the benefit of holders of certain individual life insurance policies of MLIC. Assets have been allocated to the closed block in an amount that has been determined to produce cash flows which, together with anticipated revenues from the policies included in the closed block, are reasonably expected to be sufficient to support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies, including, but not limited to, provisions for the payment of claims and certain expenses and taxes, and to provide for the continuation of policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999, if the experience underlying such dividend scales continues, and for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience changes. At least annually, the Company compares actual and projected experience against the experience assumed in the then-current dividend scales. Dividend scales are adjusted periodically to give effect to changes in experience.\n\nThe closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed block assets and the anticipated revenues from the policies in the closed block will benefit only the holders of the policies in the closed block. To the extent that, over time, cash flows from the assets allocated to the closed block and claims and other experience related to the closed block are, in the aggregate, more or less favorable than what was assumed when the closed block was established, total dividends paid to closed block policyholders in the future  may be greater than or less than the total dividends that would have been paid to these policyholders if the policyholder dividend  scales  in  effect  for  1999  had  been  continued.  Any  cash  flows  in  excess  of  amounts  assumed  will  be  available  for distribution over time to closed block policyholders and will not be available to stockholders. If the closed block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets outside of the closed block. The closed block will continue in effect as long as any policy in the closed block remains in-force. The expected life of the closed block is over 100 years from the Demutualization Date.\n\nThe Company uses the same accounting principles to account for the participating policies included in the closed block as it used prior to the Demutualization Date. However, the Company establishes a policyholder dividend obligation for earnings that will be paid to policyholders as additional dividends as described below. The excess of closed block liabilities over closed block assets at the Demutualization Date (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in AOCI) represents the estimated maximum future earnings from the closed block expected to result from operations, attributed net of income tax, to the closed block. Earnings of the closed block are recognized in income over the period the policies and contracts in the closed block remain in-force. Management believes  that  over  time  the  actual  cumulative  earnings  of  the  closed  block  will  approximately  equal  the  expected  cumulative earnings  due  to  the  effect  of  dividend  changes.  If,  over  the  period  the  closed  block  remains  in  existence,  the  actual  cumulative earnings of the closed block are greater than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block, the Company will pay the excess to  closed  block  policyholders  as  additional  policyholder  dividends  unless  offset  by  future  unfavorable  experience  of  the  closed block and, accordingly, will recognize only the expected cumulative earnings in income with the excess recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. If over such period, the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block are less than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block, the Company will recognize only the actual earnings in income. However, the Company may change policyholder dividend scales in the future, which would be intended to increase future actual earnings until the actual cumulative earnings equal the expected cumulative earnings.\n\nExperience within the closed block, in particular mortality and investment yields, as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses, directly impact the policyholder dividend obligation. Amortization of the closed block DAC, which resides outside of the closed  block,  is  based  upon  cumulative  actual  and  expected  earnings  within  the  closed  block. Accordingly,  the  Company's  net income continues to be sensitive to the actual performance of the closed block.\n\nClosed block assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are combined on a line-by-line basis with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses outside the closed block based on the nature of the particular item.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, MetLife consistently used internally developed designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS when NAIC designations were not yet available, but the underlying modeling methodology guiding these internal assessments evolved significantly. In 2022, MetLife disclosed that as of December 31, 2021, the NAIC had implemented differentiated modeling methodologies based on issuance date\u2014incorporating amortized cost for pre-2013 securities while excluding it for post-2013 securities. By 2023, MetLife reported a $4.2 billion increase (14.5%) in Level 3 fixed maturity AFS securities, with internally developed designations still in use pending NAIC evaluations. In 2024, the increase slowed to $1.6 billion (4.9%), with the same internal designation methodology in place, suggesting a more mature alignment with NAIC\u2019s evolving credit quality framework. This progression shows MetLife's consistent adherence to NAIC guidelines while navigating increasingly granular credit risk modeling and RBC alignment over the 3-year period.",

During the year ended December 31, 2024, Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS increased by $1.6 billion, or 4.9%. The increase was driven by purchases in excess of sales, partially offset by transfers out of Level 3 in ex cess of transfers into Level 3 and a decrease in estimated fair value recognized in OCI.\n\n## Fixed Maturity Securities AFS Credit Quality - Ratings\n\nThe Securities V aluation Office of the NAIC evaluates the fixed maturity securities of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes. The NAIC assigns securities  to  one  of  six   credit  quality  categories  defined  as  'NAIC  designations.'  In  general,  securities  with  NAIC  designations  of  1  and  2  are  considered investment grade and securities with NAIC designations of 3 through 6 are considered below investment grade. If no NAIC designation is available, then, as permitted by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used.\n\nNAIC designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS are based on a modeling methodology that estimates security level expected losses under a variety of economic scenarios. The modeling methodology for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued prior to January 1, 2013 incorporates the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) and the likelihood of recovery of the amortized cost; while for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued after January 1, 2013, the modeling  methodology  does  not  incorporate  the  amortized  cost  of  the  security.

Prior to December 31, 2021, the modeling methodology incorporated the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) without regard to the issuance date. As of December 31, 2021, the modeling methodology for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued prior to January 1, 2013 incorporates the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) and the likelihood of recovery of the amortized  cost;  while  for  non-agency  RMBS  and  CMBS  issued  after  January  1,  2013,  the  modeling  methodology  does  not incorporate the amortized cost of the security. The NAIC's objective with the modeling methodology is to increase accuracy in estimating expected losses, and to use the improved assessment to determine an appropriate RBC charge for non-agency RMBS and CMBS. We utilize these NAIC designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries that maintain the NAIC statutory basis of accounting. The NAIC evaluates non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by insurers on an annual basis. When MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries acquire non-agency RMBS and CMBS that have not been previously evaluated by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used until a NAIC designation becomes available.\n\nEffective  December  31,  2020,  the  NAIC  implemented  20  'NAIC  designation  categories'  which  is  an  additional,  more granular  credit  quality  categorization.  These  NAIC  designation  categories  correspond  more  closely  to  the  NRSRO's  alphanumeric credit quality ratings. Effective December 31, 2021, the NAIC implemented new unique RBC factors for each of the 20 NAIC designation categories. The NAIC's goal is to better align RBC charges on securities with the instruments' actual credit risk.\n\nRating agency ratings are based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the NAIC credit rating provider list, including Moody's Investors Service ('Moody's'), S&amp;P, Fitch Ratings ('Fitch'), DBRS Morningstar, A.M. Best Company ('A.M. Best'), Kroll Bond Rating Agency and Egan Jones Ratings Company. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.\n\nThe following table presents total fixed maturity securities AFS by NRSRO rating and the applicable NAIC designation from the NAIC published comparison of NRSRO ratings to NAIC designations, except for non-agency RMBS and CMBS, held by MetLife,  Inc.'s  insurance  subsidiaries  that  maintain  the  NAIC  statutory  basis  of  accounting,  which  are  presented  using  NAIC designations for modeled securities. NRSRO ratings and NAIC designations are as of the dates shown below. Over time, credit ratings can migrate, up or down, through the NRSRO's and NAIC's continuous monitoring process.\n\n",

      "question": "How did PayPal's exposure to abusive behaviors evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to its credit products and cross-border transactions, and what strategic actions were taken to mitigate these risks across the three-year period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal highlighted the growing risk of abusive behaviors in the context of its credit products, noting that third parties were increasingly using stolen identities and financial instruments to commit fraud at scale. By 2023, PayPal had taken a strategic step to mitigate credit risk by entering into a multi-year agreement to sell up to \u20ac40 billion of U.K. and European BNPL loan receivables, signaling a shift in how the company managed exposure to fraudulent and abusive transactions in its credit portfolio. In 2024, PayPal continued to emphasize the persistent threat of abusive behaviors, particularly in digital payments, and noted the complexity of detecting and preventing fraud attacks that could undermine consumer and merchant confidence. The company also highlighted its ongoing reliance on third-party lenders and processors, which introduced additional operational and reputational risks tied to abusive behaviors. The three-year trajectory shows PayPal's evolving approach\u2014from identifying the risk (2022), to offloading a significant portion of the exposure (2023), to reinforcing detection and prevention mechanisms while managing third-party dependencies (2024).",

        "Hop 1: [PYPL](2022) \u2192 [Abusive Behaviors]: PayPal identified increasing attempts by third parties to exploit its digital payment services through stolen identities and financial instruments, highlighting the growing challenge of detecting and preventing fraud at scale.",

The  non-payment  rate  among  account  holders  may  increase  due  to,  among  other  factors,  changes  to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a user, worsening economic conditions, such as  a  recession  or  government  austerity  programs,  increases  in  prevailing  interest  rates,  and  high  unemployment  rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our PayPal branded merchant financing offerings in the U.S. and extend credit for our consumer  and  merchants  products  outside  the  U.S.  through  our  international  subsidiaries.  If  we  are  unable  to  fund  our  credit products, or the purchase of the receivables related to our merchant financing offerings in the U.S. adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, the growth of our credit products could be negatively impacted.\n\nFor information on lending regulations that impact our business, see ' Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business -Lending Regulation ' in this risk factor section.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to: networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to  originate  our  U.S.  credit  products  to  consumers,  U.S.  merchant  financing,  and  branded  credit  card  products;  PayPalbranded  debit  card  products  issued  by  an  unaffiliated  bank;  cryptocurrency  custodial  service  providers;  and  external  business partners  and  contractors  who  provide  key  functions  (e.g.,  outsourced  customer  support  and  product  development  functions; facilities;  information  technology,  data  center  facilities  and  cloud  computing).

Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree  of  control  over  business  operations,  governance,  and  compliance,  thereby  potentially  increasing  our  financial,  legal, reputational, and operational risk.\n\n## Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\n\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits.

In  certain  markets,  cross-border  trade  represents  our  primary  (and  in  some instances our only) presence.\n\nCross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical, such as trade policy, higher tariffs, or localization requirements, could reduce our crossborder transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business.\n\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.\n\nThird parties have attempted, and we expect that they will likely continue to attempt, to abuse access to and misuse our payment services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information,  making  transactions  with  stolen  financial  instruments,  abusing  or  misusing  our  services  for  financial  gain,  or fraudulently  inducing  users  of  our  systems  into  engaging  in  bad  transactions.  Due  to  the  nature  of  PayPal's  digital  payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical transactions.

The final rule reaffirms and codifies the so-called 'valid-when-made doctrine,' which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC and PPBL products, certain installment products, and our business.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement to sell U.K. and European buy now, pay later ('BNPL') loan receivables originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., consisting of the sale of a substantial majority of the U.K. and European BNPL loan portfolio held on PayPal (Europe)'s balance sheet at the closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans. The sale of future eligible receivables is subject to certain conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived or if the parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under these arrangements, the sale of these receivables could be delayed and we may not realize the expected benefits of this arrangement.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the  payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate our  U.S. credit products to consumers,  U.S. merchant financing, and branded credit card products; branded debit card and savings products issued by unaffiliated banks; cryptocurrency custodial service providers; and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions (including, but not limited to, data center facilities and cloud computing, information technology, and outsourced customer support and product development functions). We are subject to additional risks inherent in engaging and relying upon third-party providers, including operational, legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, commercial, and resiliency risks.

This amended guidance provides transition relief for the accounting impact of reference rate reform. For a limited period, this guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying  GAAP  to  certain  contract  modifications,  hedging  relationships,  and  other  transactions  affected  by  a  reference  rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. The amended guidance is effective through December 31, 2022. Our exposure to London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') is primarily limited to an insignificant portion of our available-for-sale debt securities  and,  accordingly,  we  do  not  expect  reference  rate  reform  to  have  a  material  impact  on  our  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 2-REVENUE\n\nWe enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers  on  our  payments  platform  and  from  other  value  added  services.  Our  revenues  are  classified  into  two  categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services.\n\n## TRANSACTION REVENUES\n\nWe earn transaction revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers to receive payments on our platform. These fees may have a  fixed  and  variable  component. The  variable  component  is  generally  a  percentage  of  the  value  of  the  payment  amount  and  is known at the time the transaction is processed. For a portion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement  when  the  underlying  transaction  is  approved  for  a  refund.  We  estimate  the  amount  of  fee  refunds  that  will  be processed each quarter and record a provision against our transaction revenues. The volume of activity processed on our payments platform,  which  results  in  transaction  revenue,  is  referred  to  as  Total  Payment  V olume  ('TPV').  We  earn  additional  fees  on transactions  where  we  perform  currency  conversion,  when  we  enable  cross-border  transactions  (i.e.,  transactions  where  the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, and other miscellaneous fees. Our transaction revenues are also reduced by certain incentives provided to our customers.\n\nOur contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the notice period has lapsed. Therefore, our contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already  provided.  Our  contracts  generally  renew  automatically  without  any  significant  material  rights.  Some  of  our  contracts include tiered pricing, which are based primarily on volume. The fee charged per transaction is adjusted up or down if the volume processed for a specified period is different from prior period defined volumes. We have concluded that this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future material right since the discount is within a range typically offered to a class of customers with similar volume. We do not have any capitalized contract costs and we do not carry any material contract balances.\n\nOur primary service comprises a single performance obligation to complete payments on our payments platform for our customers. Using  our  risk  assessment  tools,  we  perform  a  transaction  risk  assessment  on  individual  transactions  to  determine  whether  a transaction should be authorized for completion on our payments platform. When we authorize a transaction, we become obligated to our customer to complete the payment transaction.\n\nWe recognize fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of  completing  a  payment  transaction. As  a  principal  to  the  transaction,  we  control  the  service  of  completing  payments  on  our payments platform. We bear primary responsibility for the fulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with our customers, control the product specifications, and define the value proposal from our services. Further, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances where we may utilize payment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment transaction. These fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing customer support.",

      "answer": "PayPal's Fixed-rate 2.850% notes remained consistently outstanding at $1.5 billion from 2022 through 2024, with no repayments or changes in principal across the three years. However, the broader debt structure around these notes evolved significantly: in 2022, the company carried $9.0 billion in total term debt, which increased to $10.638 billion by 2023 before slightly declining to $10.574 billion in 2024. The maturity of the 2.850% notes is set for 2029, indicating a long-term liability that remained unchanged while PYPL issued new debt instruments with higher interest rates in 2024 (e.g., 5.150% and 5.500% notes), suggesting a shift in financing strategy while maintaining the same long-term obligation to the 2.850% notes.",

      "question": "How did PayPal's exposure to bad transactions risk evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to its credit products, cross-border trade, and third-party dependencies, and what strategic actions were taken in 2023 to mitigate this risk?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal highlighted increasing risks of bad transactions tied to credit defaults, particularly in its U.S. consumer credit product with Synchrony Bank, and noted that economic conditions like recessions and high unemployment could exacerbate non-payment rates. In 2023, PayPal responded by entering a multi-year agreement to sell up to \u20ac40 billion of U.K. and European BNPL loan receivables, aiming to reduce exposure to bad transactions in its credit portfolio. By 2024, PayPal continued to emphasize the risks of fraud and bad transactions, particularly in digital payments, and noted ongoing challenges related to third-party reliance and regulatory uncertainty, especially around the validity of loan sales post-transfer. The strategic move in 2023 to offload BNPL receivables was a key mitigation step, reflecting a broader shift to manage credit risk and reduce exposure to bad transactions.",

The  non-payment  rate  among  account  holders  may  increase  due  to,  among  other  factors,  changes  to underwriting standards, risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a user, worsening economic conditions, such as  a  recession  or  government  austerity  programs,  increases  in  prevailing  interest  rates,  and  high  unemployment  rates. Account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans, and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our PayPal branded merchant financing offerings in the U.S. and extend credit for our consumer  and  merchants  products  outside  the  U.S.  through  our  international  subsidiaries.  If  we  are  unable  to  fund  our  credit products, or the purchase of the receivables related to our merchant financing offerings in the U.S. adequately or in a cost-effective manner, or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes, the growth of our credit products could be negatively impacted.\n\nFor information on lending regulations that impact our business, see ' Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business -Lending Regulation ' in this risk factor section.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to: networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to  originate  our  U.S.  credit  products  to  consumers,  U.S.  merchant  financing,  and  branded  credit  card  products;  PayPalbranded  debit  card  products  issued  by  an  unaffiliated  bank;  cryptocurrency  custodial  service  providers;  and  external  business partners  and  contractors  who  provide  key  functions  (e.g.,  outsourced  customer  support  and  product  development  functions; facilities;  information  technology,  data  center  facilities  and  cloud  computing). These  risks  include  legal,  regulatory,  information security,  reputational,  operational,  or  any  other  risks  inherent  in  engaging  and  relying  upon  a  third-party.  If  we  are  unable  to effectively  manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, or we experience substantial  disruptions  in  these  relationships,  our  operations,  results  of  operations,  and  financial  results  could  be  adversely impacted. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree  of  control  over  business  operations,  governance,  and  compliance,  thereby  potentially  increasing  our  financial,  legal, reputational, and operational risk.\n\n## Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\n\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that  take  place  within  a  single  country  or  market.  In  certain  markets,  cross-border  trade  represents  our  primary  (and  in  some instances our only) presence.\n\nCross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical, such as trade policy, higher tariffs, or localization requirements, could reduce our crossborder transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business.\n\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.\n\nThird parties have attempted, and we expect that they will likely continue to attempt, to abuse access to and misuse our payment services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information,  making  transactions  with  stolen  financial  instruments,  abusing  or  misusing  our  services  for  financial  gain,  or fraudulently  inducing  users  of  our  systems  into  engaging  in  bad  transactions.  Due  to  the  nature  of  PayPal's  digital  payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical transactions. Measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud and abusive behavior are complex, require continuous improvement, and may not be effective in detecting and preventing",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDeposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC') approved a final rule clarifying that loans validly originated by state-chartered banks or insured branches of foreign banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan, reflecting a similar rule finalized by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency ('OCC') in May 2020 for nationally chartered banks. The final rule reaffirms and codifies the so-called 'valid-when-made doctrine,' which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC and PPBL products, certain installment products, and our business.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement to sell U.K. and European buy now, pay later ('BNPL') loan receivables originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., consisting of the sale of a substantial majority of the U.K. and European BNPL loan portfolio held on PayPal (Europe)'s balance sheet at the closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans. The sale of future eligible receivables is subject to certain conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived or if the parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under these arrangements, the sale of these receivables could be delayed and we may not realize the expected benefits of this arrangement.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the  payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate our  U.S. credit products to consumers,  U.S. merchant financing, and branded credit card products; branded debit card and savings products issued by unaffiliated banks; cryptocurrency custodial service providers; and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions (including, but not limited to, data center facilities and cloud computing, information technology, and outsourced customer support and product development functions). We are subject to additional risks inherent in engaging and relying upon third-party providers, including operational, legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, commercial, and resiliency risks. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, we are overly reliant on certain relationships, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships (including interruptions to the availability of our products and services), our operations, results of operations, and financial results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our relationships with third parties inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance, and compliance, which potentially increases our financial, legal, reputational, and operational risk.\n\n## Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\n\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. In certain markets, cross-border trade represents our primary (and in some instances our only) offerings. Cross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including foreign exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, trade barriers or restrictions, sanctions, import or ex port controls, and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical could reduce our cross-border transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business.\n\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences may increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.\n\nWe expect that third parties will continue to attempt to abuse access to and misuse our payments services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information, taking over customer accounts or creating fraudulent accounts, making transactions with stolen financial instruments, abusing or misusing our services for financial gain, or fraudulently inducing users of our products and services into engaging in fraudulent transactions. Due to the nature of PayPal's digital payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical\n\n23",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PayPal's seamless checkout experiences evolved significantly. In 2022, the company emphasized creating seamless checkout experiences as part of its core growth strategy, aiming to increase customer use of its products and expand merchant and consumer adoption. By 2023, PayPal expanded its focus to include enhancing customer engagement through features that better address everyday needs related to accessing, managing, and moving money. The company also introduced risk and seller protection programs for merchants and buyer protection for consumers as part of its seamless checkout strategy. In 2024, PayPal further refined its seamless checkout offerings by embedding buy now, pay later solutions into PayPal and Venmo branded checkouts, helping increase consumer spend and merchant sales. Additionally, PayPal introduced tools for product discovery, price tracking, package tracking, and shopping rewards redemption, all aimed at simplifying and personalizing the shopping experience. This evolution shows a strategic shift from basic checkout optimization to a more comprehensive, omnichannel engagement and conversion strategy.",

Our strategy to drive growth in our business includes the following:\n\n- Growing our core business : through expanding our global capabilities, customer base and scale, increasing our customers' use of our products and services by better addressing their everyday needs related to accessing, managing, and moving money, creating seamless checkout experiences, and expanding the adoption of our solutions by merchants and consumers;\n- Expanding our value proposition for merchants and consumers :  by being technology and platform agnostic, partnering with our  merchants  to  grow  and  expand  their  business  online  and  in-store,  and  providing  consumers  with  simple,  secure,  and flexible ways to manage and move money across different markets, merchants, and platforms and simplifying their shopping experiences;\n- Forming strategic partnerships : by building new strategic partnerships to provide better experiences for our customers, offer greater choice and flexibility, acquire new customers, and reinforce our role in the payments ecosystem; and\n- Seeking  new  areas  of  growth :  organically  and  through  acquisitions  and  strategic  investments  in  our  existing  and  new international markets around the world and focusing on innovation in both the digital and physical world.\n\n## ESG MANAGEMENT\n\nPayPal  is  committed  to  creating  a  more  inclusive  global  economy  and  advancing  our  core  values  of  Collaboration,  Inclusion, Innovation,  and  Wellness  across  our  communities,  workforce,  and  strategies.  We  manage  priority  ESG  risks  and  opportunities through  four  key  pillars:  (1)  social  innovation,  (2)  employees  and  culture,  (3)  environmental  sustainability,  and  (4)  responsible business  practices.  We  believe  this  integrated,  enterprise-wide  approach  to  managing  our  global  business  responsibly  helps  to enable us to create value for all of our stakeholders, including our employees, stockholders, partners, and communities. In 2021, we continued to advance our ESG strategy, including through the following: a science-based approach to reducing our climate change impacts,  targeted  investments  to  address  the  racial  wealth  gap  and  empower  underserved  communities  and  businesses, programmatic development intended to foster an inclusive culture across the employee lifecycle, and ongoing enhancements to support  the  safety  and  security  of  our  products  and  platform.  We  take  this  commitment  seriously  and  endeavor  to  provide transparent disclosures on the progress of this work through our annual Global Impact Report and other communications.\n\n## TECHNOLOGY\n\nOur  payments  platform  utilizes  a  combination  of  proprietary  and  third-party  technologies  and  services  intended  to  facilitate transactions efficiently and securely between millions of merchants and consumers worldwide across different channels, markets, and networks. Our payments platform connects with financial service providers around the world and allows consumers to make purchases using a wide range of payment methods, regardless of where a merchant is located.

We  have  developed  intuitive  user  interfaces,  customer  tools,  transaction  completion databases, and network applications on our payments platform designed to enable our customers to utilize our suite of products and services. Our payments platform, open application programming interfaces, and developer tools are designed to enable developers to innovate with ease and offer robust applications to our global ecosystem of merchants and consumers, while at the same time maintaining the security of our customers' information.",

Our goal is to create the simplest checkout experience possible for consumers online or offline, including mobile. We drive increased consumer engagement by providing consumers with a wide range of services to manage their finances and enhance their ability to shop online and offline. Our PayPal and V enmo branded checkout experiences allow customers to complete purchases in just a few steps without having to enter payment and address information. We also focus on simplifying and personalizing shopping experiences for our consumers by offering tools for product discovery, price tracking, saving through deals and offers, convenient package tracking, and redemption of shopping rewards. Our PayPal- and V enmo-branded debit and credit cards give consumers the ability to transact in-person through our platform and earn incentives, including cash-back rewards.\n\nWe also offer consumers person-to-person ('P2P') payment solutions for domestic and international transfers through our PayPal, V enmo, and Xoom products and services. Our V enmo digital wallet in the United States ('U.S.') is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers. Our Xoom international money transfer service enables our customers to send money to people around the world in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way. P2P is an important source of customer engagement and also serves as a customer acquisition channel that facilitates organic growth by enabling potential users to establish active accounts with PayPal or Venmo at the time they make or receive a P2P payment.\n\nWe offer credit products to eligible consumers in certain markets as a funding source at checkout. Our consumer credit offerings include our buy now, pay later products in the U.S., United Kingdom ('U.K.'), France, and G ermany, among other markets, and in Japan through our Paidy brand. A key attribute of our buy now, pay later products is the absence of interest or consumer late fees for missed payments in most of the geographies where we offer them. Further, we offer interestbearing installment products for consumers in the U.S. (issued by an independent chartered financial institution) and in G ermany. In the U.S., consumers may apply for our PayPal- and V enmo-branded consumer credit cards and our PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product, which are offered through a partnership with an independent chartered financial institution. We offer a PayPal-issued PayPal Credit product in the U.K. We believe that our consumer credit products help us to increase engagement with consumers and merchants on our two-sided network.\n\nWe generate revenue from consumers from: foreign currency conversions, instant transfers from their PayPal or V enmo account to their bank account or debit card, and facilitating the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies; interest, fees, or other revenue from our credit products; and other miscellaneous fees. We also earn revenue from interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\n\n## Merchant value proposition\n\nMerchants use our solutions to increase conversion rates and grow and manage their business. We employ a technology and platform agnostic approach intended to enable merchants of all sizes to utilize our various products. Our diversified suite of products and services is tailored to meet the needs of merchants regardless of their size or business complexity. We offer a seamless omnichannel solution that helps merchants manage and grow their business.\n\nOur PayPal and V enmo branded checkout experiences allow customers to complete purchases in just a few steps without having to enter payment and address information. These seamless experiences reduce cart abandonment and drive higher conversion rates for merchants. Our buy now, pay later solutions are embedded into our branded checkout experiences, which can help increase consumer spend and enable merchants to grow sales.\n\nOur unbranded payments processing solutions, which includes Braintree and PayPal Complete Payments, allow merchants to quickly and easily provide digital checkout online with a variety of popular ways to pay, including debit and credit cards, digital wallets, PayPal Pay Later, and local payment methods.\n\nWe offer a suite of value added services, including payouts, payments orchestration, and fraud prevention and risk management solutions that help reduce merchant losses through proprietary protection programs. We also offer omnichannel solutions that allow merchants to make sales in person using our Zettle by PayPal app, card reader, or point of sale systems.\n\n6",

      "question": "How did American Express's reliance on aggregators and associated risks evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to merchant steering, surcharging, and third-party contractual dependencies?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express's reliance on aggregators remained a consistent operational dependency, but the associated risks evolved in complexity and regulatory exposure. In 2022, the company emphasized its dependency on aggregators to promote card acceptance, noting that third-party business interests might conflict with its own, potentially impacting card usage and merchant coverage. In 2023, the risk narrative expanded to include the growing prevalence of merchant steering and surcharging, particularly with the introduction of debit cards on the American Express network, and highlighted how aggregators' ease of implementing new technologies could influence these behaviors. By 2024, the risk profile had shifted toward legal and regulatory exposure, with litigation risks tied to merchant contract provisions and potential adverse outcomes that could force changes in business practices or increase monetary liabilities. Additionally, the 2024 report noted how competitive pressures from Visa and Mastercard, including potential interchange fee reductions and surcharging policies, could indirectly impact American Express\u2019s merchant discount rates and card acceptance dynamics through aggregator behavior.",

        "Hop 1: AXP(2022) \u2192 Aggregators: American Express acknowledged its dependency on aggregators to promote card acceptance but warned that third-party business goals might conflict with its own, potentially reducing card usage and transaction volumes.",
        "Hop 2: AXP(2023) \u2192 Aggregators: The company expanded on risks related to merchant steering and surcharging, noting that aggregators' ability to implement new technologies could influence how these practices affected card usage and merchant coverage.",
        "Hop 3: AXP(2024) \u2192 Aggregators: Legal and regulatory risks became more prominent, with potential adverse outcomes from litigation over merchant contracts that could impact aggregator relationships and business practices. Competitive pressures from Visa and Mastercard also introduced indirect risks through aggregator behavior."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nprohibiting discrimination through provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, subject to local legal requirements. When we work with merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage certain aspects of the merchant relationship, we are dependent on them to promote and support the acceptance and usage of our cards, but such third parties may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\n\nNew products, such as debit cards on the American Express network, could fail to gain market acceptance and American Express cards could become less desirable to consumers and businesses generally due to surcharging, steering or other forms of discrimination, which could result in a decrease in cards-in-force and transaction volumes. The impact could vary depending on such factors as: the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied; how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale; the ease and speed of implementation for merchants, including as a result of new or emerging technologies; the size and recurrence of the underlying charges; and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment, including whether it varies depending on the type of card (e.g., credit or debit), product, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business.\n\n## We may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion, merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and services, or to effectively control the costs of such investments, both of which may materially impact our profitability.\n\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, retain existing Card Members and capture a greater share of customers' total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments will continue to be effective, particularly with changing consumer and business behaviors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage or merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards, our business could suffer. Expanding our service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, fail to resonate with customers, adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand.\n\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on third parties for certain redemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future, which could diminish the value of the program for our Card Members. Our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. In addition, many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours. Our inability to differentiate our products and services could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future. If such expenses increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues, decreasing operating expenses or other investments in our business, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment. In addition, increased costs as a result of inflation, colleague retention and recruitment, supply chain issues and shortages of materials such as chips for our cards, and readiness efforts for returning to our offices may require that we reduce investments in other areas.\n\n## Our brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\n\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and realize the benefits of the value of our brand. Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, privacy and data protection, management, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, financial condition, response to political and social issues or catastrophic events (including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters) and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters - even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct-could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members, corporate clients, merchants and partners, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of customer information, conduct by our colleagues and policy engagement, including activities of the American Express Company Political Action Committee, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto. Discussion about such matters in social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand.",

Many of these actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages and require us to incur significant costs for legal representation, arbitration fees or other legal or related services. While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our ex posure to class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future, including as a result of legal challenges to, and new regulations affecting, our arbitration provisions, and claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities, risks and costs associated with class action cases. The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation.\n\nWe expect that financial institutions, such as us, will continue to face significant regulatory scrutiny, with regulators taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non-public supervisory actions or findings, which could involve restrictions on our activities, among other limitations, that could adversely affect our business. In addition, a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us. Further, a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings. External publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries.\n\nWe are also involved at any given time with governmental and regulatory inquiries, investigations and proceedings. Regulatory scrutiny has continued to increase in a number of areas, and regulatory action could subject us to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in Card Member reimbursements, increased expenses, limitations or conditions on our business activities, and damage to our reputation and our brand, all of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. For example, as previously disclosed, we entered into agreements to resolve governmental investigations related to historical sales practices for certain U.S. small business customers, which are described in more detail in Note 12 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements.' In addition, we are cooperating with ongoing regulatory inquiries concerning our rewards and benefits programs, as described in 'Supervision and Regulation' under 'Business.'\n\nLegal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, changes to our merchant agreements and/or business practices, substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand.\n\nWe are, and have been in the past, a defendant in a number of actions, including legal proceedings, arbitrations and proposed class actions, challenging certain provisions of our card acceptance agreements. See Note 12 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for a description of certain outstanding legal proceedings.\n\nAn adverse outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member experience, result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand. Even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements, changes in Visa's and Mastercard's policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings, lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions pending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability. For example, in 2024 Visa and Mastercard proposed a lawsuit settlement agreement that would have, among other things, required reductions and caps on interchange fees and streamlined requirements for merchants who wish to impose a surcharge on credit transactions. While the settlement agreement was not approved by the court, Visa and Mastercard may ultimately agree or be subject to changes in policies or practices that result in greater surcharging generally or downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with reductions and caps on interchange fees.\n\n## We rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business.\n\nWe rely on third-party service providers, cobrand partners, merchants, affiliate marketing firms, processors, aggregators, network partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business. As outsourcing, specialization of functions, third-party digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase (including with respect to mobile technologies, tokenization, big data, artificial intelligence and cloud-based solutions), more third parties are involved in processing card transactions, handling our data and supporting our operations. For example, we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network, card acquisition and provision of services to our customers.\n\nWe have experienced in certain limited circumstances and may continue to experience disruptions or other events at our third parties or our third parties' service providers, including their failure to fulfill their obligations and the information, cybersecurity and operational incidents described above. Such disruptions or other events could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers, impact the confidentiality, integrity, availability and security of our data, lead to fraudulent transactions on our cards or other products, impact our business, cause brand or reputational damage, and lead to costs associated with responding to such a disruption, including notification and remediation costs, costs to switch service providers or move operations in house, regulatory investigations and fines and increased regulatory oversight and litigation. Third parties may face similar or greater risks as us, including as a result of their relationship with us; however, they may be less prepared to mitigate those risks and may be",

      "question": "How did American Express's competitive positioning and regulatory dependency on card networks evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in light of increasing regulatory scrutiny, competitive pressures from other networks, and shifts in strategic focus?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express transitioned from a primarily competitive stance toward card networks like Visa and Mastercard to a more complex relationship marked by regulatory dependency and exposure to external pressures. In 2022, Amex emphasized its position as the fourth-largest global card network behind China UnionPay, Visa, and Mastercard, and highlighted intense competition in premium card issuance and cobrand relationships. In 2023, the company reiterated its competitive pressures but expanded on the growing influence of alternative payment platforms like PayPal and Alipay, and the increasing importance of digital innovation and closed-loop loyalty systems. By 2024, Amex\u2019s relationship with card networks had evolved into one of regulatory entanglement, with increased exposure to interchange fee caps, network routing regulations, and compliance costs, particularly in the EU and Australia, where Amex exited its network licensing businesses. This 3-year evolution reveals a shift from direct competition to a landscape where regulatory constraints and network interdependencies significantly shape Amex\u2019s strategic flexibility.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nWe compete in the global payments industry with card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks), bank transfer models (e.g., wire transfers and Automated Clearing House, or ACH), as well as evolving and growing alternative mechanisms, systems and products that leverage new technologies, business models and customer relationships to create payment or financing solutions. The payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies, consumer habits and merchant needs, some of which have accelerated as a result of the pandemic, such as an increased shift to e-commerce and demand for contactless payments.\n\nAs a card issuer, we compete with financial institutions that issue general-purpose credit and debit cards. We also encounter competition from businesses that issue private label cards, operate mobile wallets or extend credit. We face intense competition in the premium space and for cobrand relationships, as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted high-spending customers and key business partners with attractive value propositions. We also face competition for partners and other differentiated offerings, such as lounge space in U.S. and global hub airports.\n\nOur global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks, including, among others, China UnionPay, Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover and Diners Club International (which is owned by Discover). We are the fourth largest general-purpose card network globally based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and Mastercard. In addition to such networks, a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers, processors and web- and mobile-based payment platforms (e.g., Alipay, PayPal and Venmo), as well as regional payment networks (such as the National Payments Corporation of India), carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMNS business.\n\nThe principal competitive factors that affect the card-issuing, merchant and network businesses include:\n\n- The features, value and quality of the products and services, including customer care, rewards programs, partnerships, travel and lifestyle-related benefits, and digital and mobile services, as well as the costs associated with providing such features and services\n- Reputation and brand recognition\n- The number, spending characteristics and credit performance of customers\n- The quantity, diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used\n- The attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers, merchant acquirers, cardholders, corporate clients and merchants (including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services, and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics)\n- The number and quality of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers\n- The success of marketing and promotional campaigns\n- The speed of innovation and investment in systems, technologies, and product and service offerings\n- The nature and quality of expense management tools, electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities, particularly for business customers\n- The security of cardholder, merchant and network partner information\n\nAnother aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products, which include payment aggregators, digital payment and electronic wallet platforms, point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products, real-time settlement and processing systems, financial technology companies, digital currencies developed by both central banks and the private sector, blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies, prepaid systems and gift cards, and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions. Various competitors are integrating more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are seeking to attain the benefits of closed-loop, loyalty and rewards functionalities, such as ours.",

New laws or regulations could similarly affect our business, increase the costs and complexity of doing business, impact what we are able to charge for, or offer in connection with, our products and services, impose conflicting obligations, and require us to change certain of our business practices and invest significant management attention and resources, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Political developments can result in legislative and regulatory uncertainty and changes to supervisory and enforcement priorities. In addition, legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other's approaches to the regulation of the financial services industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another.\n\nIf we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or engage in certain business activities or acquisitions, which could compromise our competitive position. Additionally, our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital. In 2024, we became a Category III firm for purposes of the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies' tailoring framework, resulting in us becoming subject to heightened regulatory expectations and more stringent regulatory requirements. As we continue to grow, these expectations and requirements may further increase, such as if we become a Category II firm, which may increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business.\n\nLegislators and regulators continue to focus on the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard, network routing practices and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. While in some cases our business is subject to exemptions related to certain of these regulations, there is no guarantee that such ex emptions will continue to be available and even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees significantly negatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend, or may extend, to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements, new products or services we may offer, or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-all-cards. For example, we have exited our network licensing businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. See 'Supervision and Regulation - Payments Regulation' under 'Business' for more information. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, a number of federal and state laws to regulate various aspects of network operations are being considered or have passed, including regarding information associated with electronic transactions (such as the use of specific merchant categories codes or limitations on the use of transaction data) and pricing of electronic transactions (such as interchange fees on sales tax  or gratuities).\n\nLegislators and regulators also continue to focus on consumer protection, including product design and pricing constructs, account management and security, credit bureau reporting, disclosure rules, marketing and debt collection practices. This focus has included fees associated with card and banking products, such as a rule issued by the CFPB related to credit card fees for late payments (which is currently stayed); interest rates, such as recent proposals to cap credit card interest rates; rewards programs, such as the recent inquiries by the CFPB and DOT focused on credit card and airline rewards programs; and factors considered by financial institutions in providing services, such as 'fair access' laws. Any new requirements or increased enforcement of existing requirements could materially and adversely impact our revenue growth and profitability, including, as a result of increased scrutiny of our pricing, underwriting and account management practices; the imposition of fines and customer remediation; higher compliance costs; reputational harm; restrictions on our ability to issue cards, appropriately price for the value of our products or work with certain business partners; and changes to our business practices generally.\n\nWe are subject to significant supervision and regulation with respect to compliance with AML/CFT laws, sanctions regimes and anti-corruption laws in numerous jurisdictions. As regulators increase their focus in these areas, new technologies such as digital currencies develop, near real-time money movement solutions are adopted, we introduce new products like checking accounts and geopolitical tensions increase, we face increased costs related to oversight, supervision and potential fines. Our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny, and we are working to make enhancements to our existing programs, policies and procedures and to identify and remediate deficiencies. For example, we recently voluntarily reported certain transactions and accounts to OFAC, some of which related to Iran, as described in 'Supervision and Regulation - Anti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Compliance' under 'Business.' Errors, failures or delays in complying with AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, deficiencies in our related compliance programs or association of our business with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud or other illicit activities or sanctioned persons, entities, governments or countries can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits, which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets, loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities, or other enforcement actions, and our reputation may suffer due to our customers' association with certain countries, persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions. Additionally, our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or affect our relationships with certain partners, service providers and other third parties.\n\nSee 'Supervision and Regulation' under 'Business' for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us.",

      "question": "How did American Express's revenue structure and contractual arrangements with third-party merchant acquirers evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of discount revenue recognition, network rate fee negotiation, and merchant coverage expansion strategies?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express's relationship with third-party merchant acquirers evolved significantly. In 2022, discount revenue was primarily derived from merchant discounts that varied based on industry, transaction volume, and geographic scope, with third-party acquirers (e.g., under the OptBlue program or GNS partners) receiving individually negotiated network rate fees. In 2023, the company clarified that it receives a negotiated network rate fee from third-party acquirers, which is recorded as discount revenue at the time of transaction, and also introduced processed revenue from network partnership agreements, including royalties and fees for facilitating transactions on cards issued by partners. By 2024, American Express emphasized expanding merchant coverage globally, particularly through third-party acquirers, aggregators, and processors, with a focus on enhancing value propositions for merchants and acquirers, scaling marketing efforts, and increasing digital integration of its authorization platform. This progression shows a strategic shift toward deeper collaboration with third-party acquirers to boost global acceptance and optimize revenue streams through both discount and processed revenue.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nAccounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management's assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ.\n\n## INCOME STATEMENT\n\n## Discount Revenue\n\nDiscount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\n\nThe card acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network.\n\nIn cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on behalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other revenue.\n\nRevenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) is not required to be disclosed. Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material.\n\n## Net Card Fees\n\nNet card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore more stable in relation to short term business or economic shifts. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nEffective April 1, 2021, we prospectively changed the recognition of certain costs paid to a third party previously recognized over the twelve month card membership period in Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income; such costs are now recorded as incurred in Marketing and business development expense. This change is not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Fees and Commissions\n\nOther fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other fees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express's relationship with alternative payment mechanisms shifted from a purely competitive stance to a more nuanced position involving both competition and dependency. In 2022, AXP explicitly listed alternative payment mechanisms\u2014such as digital wallets (e.g., PayPal, Venmo), real-time settlement systems, and fintech platforms\u2014as growing competitive threats, emphasizing their rapid adoption and technological innovation. By 2023, the company expanded its list of competitive alternative mechanisms to include open banking and payment facilitators, signaling an increasing awareness of the breadth and sophistication of these alternatives. In 2024, AXP acknowledged a strategic pivot, indicating that it must invest in and adopt these same alternative payment and financing mechanisms\u2014including AI, machine learning, open banking, and real-time settlement\u2014to remain competitive, thus showing a dependency on these technologies rather than just viewing them as threats. This evolution reveals a multi-year strategic shift from defensive competition to proactive integration of alternative payment innovations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nWe compete in the global payments industry with card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks), bank transfer models (e.g., wire transfers and Automated Clearing House, or ACH), as well as evolving and growing alternative mechanisms, systems and products that leverage new technologies, business models and customer relationships to create payment or financing solutions. The payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies, consumer habits and merchant needs, some of which have accelerated as a result of the pandemic, such as an increased shift to e-commerce and demand for contactless payments.\n\nAs a card issuer, we compete with financial institutions that issue general-purpose credit and debit cards. We also encounter competition from businesses that issue private label cards, operate mobile wallets or extend credit. We face intense competition in the premium space and for cobrand relationships, as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted high-spending customers and key business partners with attractive value propositions. We also face competition for partners and other differentiated offerings, such as lounge space in U.S. and global hub airports.\n\nOur global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks, including, among others, China UnionPay, Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover and Diners Club International (which is owned by Discover). We are the fourth largest general-purpose card network globally based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and Mastercard. In addition to such networks, a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers, processors and web- and mobile-based payment platforms (e.g., Alipay, PayPal and Venmo), as well as regional payment networks (such as the National Payments Corporation of India), carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMNS business.\n\nThe principal competitive factors that affect the card-issuing, merchant and network businesses include:\n\n- The features, value and quality of the products and services, including customer care, rewards programs, partnerships, travel and lifestyle-related benefits, and digital and mobile services, as well as the costs associated with providing such features and services\n- Reputation and brand recognition\n- The number, spending characteristics and credit performance of customers\n- The quantity, diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used\n- The attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers, merchant acquirers, cardholders, corporate clients and merchants (including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services, and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics)\n- The number and quality of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers\n- The success of marketing and promotional campaigns\n- The speed of innovation and investment in systems, technologies, and product and service offerings\n- The nature and quality of expense management tools, electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities, particularly for business customers\n- The security of cardholder, merchant and network partner information\n\nAnother aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products, which include payment aggregators, digital payment and electronic wallet platforms, point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products, real-time settlement and processing systems, financial technology companies, digital currencies developed by both central banks and the private sector, blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies, prepaid systems and gift cards, and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions. Various competitors are integrating more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are seeking to attain the benefits of closed-loop, loyalty and rewards functionalities, such as ours.",

These risks to our brand and reputation, as well as other risks described in this Risk Factors section, are heightened by the increasing sophistication and availability of artificial intelligence technology, including by assisting with the creation of deepfakes and increasing the velocity of distribution of disinformation. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our business volumes, revenues and profitability.\n\nWe face increased scrutiny from stakeholders who have diverging views related to business practices and company activities, which could result in reputational harm, litigation, enforcement actions and other adverse consequences. In addition, we are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and legal risks related to environmental, social and governance topics, such as those arising from new disclosure requirements in certain jurisdictions. Inaccurate perceptions or mischaracterizations of disclosures on these topics, or our goals and initiatives, while outside of our control, could impact our reputation, colleague hiring and retention and public perceptions of our business.\n\n## If we are not able to successfully invest in, and compete with respect to, technological developments and new products and services across all our businesses, our revenue and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in technology across all areas of our business, including in transaction processing, data management and analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, customer interactions and communications, open banking and alternative payment and financing mechanisms, authentication technologies and digital identification, tokenization, real-time settlement and risk management and compliance systems. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services, including developing the appropriate governance and controls consistent with regulatory expectations, requires substantial expenditures and takes considerable time, and may have unintended consequences or ultimately be unsuccessful. We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, our ex isting technology.\n\nThe process of developing new products and services, enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may develop products, platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted by consumers, merchants or service providers than ours, including as a result of increased involvement by technology companies in the payments industry and our competitors' greater scale or ability to pursue and adopt new technologies. In addition, we may underestimate the resources needed and overestimate our ability to develop new products and services, particularly beyond our traditional card products and travel-related services.\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, including generative artificial intelligence, has increased rapidly with the increasing sophistication and applications of the technology. Our and our partners' use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is subject to various risks including flaws in models or datasets that may result in biased or inaccurate results, unintended or unexpected outcomes, ethical considerations regarding artificial intelligence, infringement of intellectual property rights, ex posure of proprietary or personal information, heightened security risks and the ability to safely deploy and implement governance and controls for artificial intelligence systems. The complex ity of these technologies can make it difficult to assess proper operation, reduce error, or understand and explain their outputs. Adverse consequences of artificial intelligence and machine learning remain uncertain but could include flaws in the decisions, predictions, outputs or analysis such technologies produce and subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm.\n\nOur ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the emergence of industry-wide standards, a changing legislative and regulatory environment, an inability to develop appropriate governance and controls, a lack of internal product and engineering expertise, resistance to change from Card Members, merchants or service providers, lack of appropriate change management processes or the complexity of our systems. In addition, our adoption of new technologies and our introduction of new products and services may increase operational complexity and risk, and expose us to new or enhanced risks, particularly in areas where we have less experience or our existing governance and control systems may be insufficient, which could require us to make substantial expenditures or subject us to legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm.\n\n## We may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and investment activity, and our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments, and continue to evaluate potential transactions. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, value potential investment or acquisition opportunities accurately, negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, or complete proposed acquisitions and investments. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including in integrating systems and personnel or further developing the acquired business or technology, result in unanticipated liabilities, including legal claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes and information security vulnerabilities or breaches (including from not integrating the acquired company, business or technology quickly or appropriately, from activities that occurred prior to the acquisition, from inadequate systems or controls of the acquired company, and from exposure to third party relationships of the acquired company or business or new laws and regulations), and harm our business generally. Expanding to new businesses, geographies or customer types through acquisitions may subject us to new risks and we may not have the relevant expertise or business structure to achieve the desired results. It may take us longer than ex pected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results, including as a result of write-downs of goodwill and other intangible assets.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal highlighted concerns about third-party fraud schemes involving fictitious accounts, stolen financial instruments, and abusive misuse of services, noting the difficulty in detecting such digital fraud at scale. In 2023, the company expanded on this risk in the context of its growing credit products, particularly its U.K. and European BNPL loan receivables, with a \u20ac40 billion multi-year agreement to sell these receivables, indicating a strategic move to mitigate credit and fraud-related losses. By 2024, PayPal continued to emphasize the evolving nature of abusive behaviors, particularly in the context of digital payments and third-party reliance, while also noting the impact of regulatory uncertainties such as the 'valid-when-made doctrine' on its U.S. credit products. The progression shows a consistent and growing concern around abusive behaviors, with PayPal increasingly relying on third-party risk mitigation strategies and regulatory clarity to manage this evolving threat.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDeposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC') approved a final rule clarifying that loans validly originated by state-chartered banks or insured branches of foreign banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan, reflecting a similar rule finalized by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency ('OCC') in May 2020 for nationally chartered banks. The final rule reaffirms and codifies the so-called 'valid-when-made doctrine,' which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC and PPBL products, certain installment products, and our business.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement to sell U.K. and European buy now, pay later ('BNPL') loan receivables originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., consisting of the sale of a substantial majority of the U.K. and European BNPL loan portfolio held on PayPal (Europe)'s balance sheet at the closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans. The sale of future eligible receivables is subject to certain conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived or if the parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under these arrangements, the sale of these receivables could be delayed and we may not realize the expected benefits of this arrangement.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the  payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate our  U.S. credit products to consumers,  U.S. merchant financing, and branded credit card products; branded debit card and savings products issued by unaffiliated banks; cryptocurrency custodial service providers; and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions (including, but not limited to, data center facilities and cloud computing, information technology, and outsourced customer support and product development functions). We are subject to additional risks inherent in engaging and relying upon third-party providers, including operational, legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, commercial, and resiliency risks. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, we are overly reliant on certain relationships, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships (including interruptions to the availability of our products and services), our operations, results of operations, and financial results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our relationships with third parties inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance, and compliance, which potentially increases our financial, legal, reputational, and operational risk.\n\n## Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\n\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. In certain markets, cross-border trade represents our primary (and in some instances our only) offerings. Cross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including foreign exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, trade barriers or restrictions, sanctions, import or ex port controls, and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical could reduce our cross-border transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business.\n\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences may increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.\n\nWe expect that third parties will continue to attempt to abuse access to and misuse our payments services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information, taking over customer accounts or creating fraudulent accounts, making transactions with stolen financial instruments, abusing or misusing our services for financial gain, or fraudulently inducing users of our products and services into engaging in fraudulent transactions. Due to the nature of PayPal's digital payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical\n\n23",

      "question": "How did PayPal's exposure to margin risk evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in relation to its discretion in setting fees and the role of transaction expenses tied to payment processors?",
      "answer": "Across the three years, PayPal consistently bore full margin risk when completing payment transactions, with its discretion in setting fees remaining independent of costs incurred with payment processors or other financial institutions. In 2022, PayPal explicitly stated it bore full margin risk and recognized fees paid to processors as transaction expense. In 2023, the language remained consistent, with emphasis on its control over fee determination and the recognition of processor fees as transaction expense. In 2024, despite the adoption of new segment reporting standards (ASU 2023-07), PayPal maintained its position of bearing full margin risk, with no indication of structural changes to its fee-setting discretion or cost structure related to processors. Thus, the margin risk exposure remained stable across the three years, with consistent accounting treatment and no material changes in how fees or transaction costs were recognized.",

The  amended  guidance requires incremental reportable segment disclosures, primarily about significant segment expenses. The amendments also require entities with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by these amendments, and all existing segment disclosures. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.  We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2024.  For additional information, see 'Note 18-Segment Information.'\n\nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these new accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 2-REVENUE\n\nWe enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers on our payments platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into two categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services.\n\n## TRANSACTION REVENUES\n\nWe earn transaction revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers to receive payments on our platform. These fees may have a fixed and variable component. The variable component is generally a percentage of the value of the payment amount and is known at the time the transaction is processed. For a portion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement when the underlying transaction is approved for a refund. We estimate the amount of fee refunds that will be processed each quarter and record a provision against our transaction revenues. The volume of activity processed on our payments platform, which  results  in  transaction  revenue,  is  referred  to  as  Total  Payment  V olume  ('TPV ').  We  generate  additional  revenues  from  merchants  and  consumers:  on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or V enmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees. Our transaction revenues are also reduced by certain incentives provided to our customers.\n\nOur contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the notice period has lapsed. Therefore, our contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already provided. Our contracts generally renew automatically without any significant material rights. Some of our contracts include tiered pricing, which are based primarily on volume. The fee charged per transaction is adjusted up or down if the volume processed for a specified period is different from prior period defined volumes.  We have concluded that this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future material right since the discount is within a range typically offered to a class of customers with similar volume. We do not have any capitalized contract costs.\n\nOur primary service comprises a single performance obligation to complete payments on our payments platform for our customers. Using our risk assessment tools, we perform a transaction risk assessment on individual transactions to determine whether a transaction should be authorized for completion on our payments platform. When we authorize a transaction, we become obligated to our customer to complete the payment transaction.\n\nWe recognize fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of completing a payment transaction. As a principal to the transaction, we control the service of completing payments on our payments platform. We bear primary responsibility for the fulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with our customers, control the product specifications, and define the value proposal from our services. Further, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances where we may utilize payment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment transaction. These fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing customer support.",

This amended guidance provides transition relief for the accounting impact of reference rate reform. For a limited period, this guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying  GAAP  to  certain  contract  modifications,  hedging  relationships,  and  other  transactions  affected  by  a  reference  rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. The amended guidance is effective through December 31, 2022. Our exposure to London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') is primarily limited to an insignificant portion of our available-for-sale debt securities  and,  accordingly,  we  do  not  expect  reference  rate  reform  to  have  a  material  impact  on  our  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable.

      "question": "How did PYPL's exposure to its 2029-maturing Fixed-rate 2.850% notes evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern suggest about the company's long-term debt management strategy?",
      "answer": "PYPL's exposure to the Fixed-rate 2.850% notes maturing in 2029 remained consistently at $1,500 million across 2022, 2023, and 2024, indicating no principal reduction or refinancing activity for this specific instrument over the three-year period. Despite issuing new debt in 2023 and 2024, including higher-interest notes in 2024 such as the Fixed-rate 5.150% and 5.500% notes, PYPL maintained its $1,500 million liability for the 2029 notes. This suggests a strategic decision to retain this particular debt instrument, possibly to preserve favorable interest terms or manage cash flow predictability.",

      "question": "How did PayPal's exposure to 'bad transactions' risk evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to its BNPL loan portfolio sales, third-party fraud attempts, and regulatory challenges impacting its credit products?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PayPal's exposure to 'bad transactions' risk evolved significantly as it expanded its credit offerings and offloaded BNPL loan portfolios. In 2022, PayPal highlighted the risk of fraud and abuse in its digital payment services, noting that third parties attempted to misuse its systems through stolen identities, fake accounts, and fraudulent transactions. The company also warned about credit risk in its U.S. consumer credit product, particularly the risk of non-payment and charge-offs. In 2023, PayPal entered into a multi-year agreement to sell up to \u20ac40 billion of U.K. and European BNPL loan receivables, signaling an effort to mitigate credit risk by offloading exposure. However, it also noted that failure to meet conditions in these arrangements could delay the expected benefits and increase risk. By 2024, PayPal faced new regulatory uncertainty due to ongoing legal challenges around the 'valid-when-made doctrine,' which could impact its ability to rely on federal preemption of state usury laws when purchasing loan receivables. This regulatory risk, combined with persistent fraud threats and the complexity of managing third-party relationships, indicated a shifting but ongoing exposure to 'bad transactions' risk across its evolving credit and payments ecosystem.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDeposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC') approved a final rule clarifying that loans validly originated by state-chartered banks or insured branches of foreign banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan, reflecting a similar rule finalized by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency ('OCC') in May 2020 for nationally chartered banks. The final rule reaffirms and codifies the so-called 'valid-when-made doctrine,' which provides that the permissibility of an interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale, assignment, or other transfer. While a number of state attorneys general have unsuccessfully challenged these FDIC and OCC rules, there remains some uncertainty whether non-bank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws. An adverse outcome of these or similar challenges, or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy, could materially impact our U.S. PPWC and PPBL products, certain installment products, and our business.\n\nWe currently purchase receivables related to our U.S. PayPal-branded merchant financing offerings and certain U.S. consumer installment loan products and extend credit for our consumer and merchant products outside the U.S. through our international subsidiaries. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement to sell U.K. and European buy now, pay later ('BNPL') loan receivables originated by PayPal (Europe) and PayPal U.K., consisting of the sale of a substantial majority of the U.K. and European BNPL loan portfolio held on PayPal (Europe)'s balance sheet at the closing of the transaction and a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations of eligible loans. The sale of future eligible receivables is subject to certain conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived or if the parties are unable to fulfill their obligations under these arrangements, the sale of these receivables could be delayed and we may not realize the expected benefits of this arrangement.\n\n## We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.\n\nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways that link us to the  payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions; unaffiliated third-party lenders to originate our  U.S. credit products to consumers,  U.S. merchant financing, and branded credit card products; branded debit card and savings products issued by unaffiliated banks; cryptocurrency custodial service providers; and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions (including, but not limited to, data center facilities and cloud computing, information technology, and outsourced customer support and product development functions). We are subject to additional risks inherent in engaging and relying upon third-party providers, including operational, legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, commercial, and resiliency risks. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us, we are overly reliant on certain relationships, or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships (including interruptions to the availability of our products and services), our operations, results of operations, and financial results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our relationships with third parties inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance, and compliance, which potentially increases our financial, legal, reputational, and operational risk.\n\n## Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.\n\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is an important source of our revenues and profits. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. In certain markets, cross-border trade represents our primary (and in some instances our only) offerings. Cross-border trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including foreign exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, trade barriers or restrictions, sanctions, import or ex port controls, and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of cross-border trade and foreign exchange. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical could reduce our cross-border transactions and volume, negatively impact our revenues and profits, and harm our business.\n\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud, abusive behaviors, bad transactions, and negative customer experiences may increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.\n\nWe expect that third parties will continue to attempt to abuse access to and misuse our payments services to commit fraud by, among other things, creating fictitious PayPal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information, taking over customer accounts or creating fraudulent accounts, making transactions with stolen financial instruments, abusing or misusing our services for financial gain, or fraudulently inducing users of our products and services into engaging in fraudulent transactions.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PayPal's focus on seamless checkout experiences matured from a general strategic goal into a more integrated and feature-rich component of its platform. In 2022, PayPal emphasized the creation of seamless checkout experiences as part of its core business growth strategy, aiming to better address consumer needs and expand merchant adoption. By 2023, the company had begun leveraging proprietary technology and platform integrations to facilitate secure and efficient transactions across 200 markets and 150 currencies, enhancing the checkout experience through intuitive user interfaces and developer tools. In 2024, PayPal further deepened this focus by embedding buy now, pay later (BNPL) solutions directly into its PayPal and Venmo-branded checkout experiences, supporting consumer flexibility without interest or late fees in most markets. Additionally, PayPal expanded its omnichannel merchant solutions, including Zettle by PayPal, to reduce cart abandonment and increase merchant conversion rates.

Our goal is to create the simplest checkout experience possible for consumers online or offline, including mobile. We drive increased consumer engagement by providing consumers with a wide range of services to manage their finances and enhance their ability to shop online and offline. Our PayPal and V enmo branded checkout experiences allow customers to complete purchases in just a few steps without having to enter payment and address information. We also focus on simplifying and personalizing shopping experiences for our consumers by offering tools for product discovery, price tracking, saving through deals and offers, convenient package tracking, and redemption of shopping rewards. Our PayPal- and V enmo-branded debit and credit cards give consumers the ability to transact in-person through our platform and earn incentives, including cash-back rewards.\n\nWe also offer consumers person-to-person ('P2P') payment solutions for domestic and international transfers through our PayPal, V enmo, and Xoom products and services. Our V enmo digital wallet in the United States ('U.S.') is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers. Our Xoom international money transfer service enables our customers to send money to people around the world in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way. P2P is an important source of customer engagement and also serves as a customer acquisition channel that facilitates organic growth by enabling potential users to establish active accounts with PayPal or Venmo at the time they make or receive a P2P payment.\n\nWe offer credit products to eligible consumers in certain markets as a funding source at checkout. Our consumer credit offerings include our buy now, pay later products in the U.S., United Kingdom ('U.K.'), France, and G ermany, among other markets, and in Japan through our Paidy brand. A key attribute of our buy now, pay later products is the absence of interest or consumer late fees for missed payments in most of the geographies where we offer them. Further, we offer interestbearing installment products for consumers in the U.S. (issued by an independent chartered financial institution) and in G ermany. In the U.S., consumers may apply for our PayPal- and V enmo-branded consumer credit cards and our PayPal Credit revolving consumer credit product, which are offered through a partnership with an independent chartered financial institution. We offer a PayPal-issued PayPal Credit product in the U.K. We believe that our consumer credit products help us to increase engagement with consumers and merchants on our two-sided network.\n\nWe generate revenue from consumers from: foreign currency conversions, instant transfers from their PayPal or V enmo account to their bank account or debit card, and facilitating the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies; interest, fees, or other revenue from our credit products; and other miscellaneous fees. We also earn revenue from interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\n\n## Merchant value proposition\n\nMerchants use our solutions to increase conversion rates and grow and manage their business. We employ a technology and platform agnostic approach intended to enable merchants of all sizes to utilize our various products. Our diversified suite of products and services is tailored to meet the needs of merchants regardless of their size or business complexity. We offer a seamless omnichannel solution that helps merchants manage and grow their business.\n\nOur PayPal and V enmo branded checkout experiences allow customers to complete purchases in just a few steps without having to enter payment and address information. These seamless experiences reduce cart abandonment and drive higher conversion rates for merchants. Our buy now, pay later solutions are embedded into our branded checkout experiences, which can help increase consumer spend and enable merchants to grow sales.\n\nOur unbranded payments processing solutions, which includes Braintree and PayPal Complete Payments, allow merchants to quickly and easily provide digital checkout online with a variety of popular ways to pay, including debit and credit cards, digital wallets, PayPal Pay Later, and local payment methods.\n\nWe offer a suite of value added services, including payouts, payments orchestration, and fraud prevention and risk management solutions that help reduce merchant losses through proprietary protection programs. We also offer omnichannel solutions that allow merchants to make sales in person using our Zettle by PayPal app, card reader, or point of sale systems.\n\n6",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AIG's international terrorism exposure management remained consistent in its modeling approach but evolved in terms of reinsurance protections and risk mitigation strategies. In 2022, AIG estimated a $1.3 billion loss for a five-ton bomb attack in New York City, net of TRIPRA and reinsurance. By 2023, AIG emphasized routine monitoring of international terrorism exposure concentration and targeted reinsurance purchases for certain lines of business. In 2024, AIG retained core attachment points for Japan at $200 million and $125 million for the rest of the world, while also purchasing global property per risk covers for non-critical and critical catastrophe events outside North America. Additionally, AIG held $20.1 billion in collateral to support reinsurance recoverable assets. This progression shows a strategic deepening of reinsurance and risk alignment mechanisms over time.",

          "chunk_text": "For Validus Re, our catastrophe protection comes from a variety of reinsurance protections but is largely providing $400 million of per occurrence limit in excess of a $150 million retention for US windstorm and earthquake, $150 million of per occurrence limit in excess of a $200 million retention for Europe, Japan and other US perils and in excess of $125 million retention for rest of the world perils. Further to the occurrence protection, there is $175 million of limit in excess of a $350 million retention (subject to per event caps) placed on a worldwide aggregate excess of loss cover and $400 million of limit excess $550 million on an aggregate index basis via the renewed Tailwind Re Cat Bond which covers U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada named storm losses.\n\nActual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\n\nFor additional information see also Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures.\n\n## Terrorism Risk\n\nWe actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. We have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies' exposures. Examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.\n\nOur largest terrorism concentrations are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers' Compensation lines of business. At our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $1.3 billion based on the exposures as of October 1, 2021.\n\nOur exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by TRIPRA in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers certified terrorist attacks within the United States or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. In 2021, TRIPRA covers 80 percent of insured losses above a deductible. The current estimate of our deductible is approximately $1.7 billion for 2021.\n\nWe offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Life and Retirement Companies' Key Risks\n\nWe manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing and underwriting discipline, risk limits and thresholds, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the alignment between risk and cash flow profiles of assets and liabilities, and hedging instruments.\n\nFor Life and Retirement companies, risks include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLongevity risk -represents the risk of an increase in liabilities associated with an insurance product, e.g. an annuity policy or a payout benefit as a result of actual mortality experience being lower than the expected mortality experience. This risk could arise from medical advancement and longer-term societal health changes. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our annuity products.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nMorbidity risk - represents the risk arising from actual morbidity (e.g. illness, disability or disease) incidence rate being higher than expected or the length of the claims extending longer than expected resulting in a higher overall benefit payout. This risk could arise from longer-term medical advances in detection and treatment for various diseases and medical conditions resulting in higher claim amounts. This risk exists in a number of our product lines such as individual and group accident and health and long-term care businesses which for the most part are in run-off, and ceded to Fortitude Re.\n\nMortality (including pandemic) risk -represents the risk of unexpected loss arising from current actual mortality experience being higher than expected mortality experience. This risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher-than-expected current mortality. This risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 167",

Our exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization A ct (TRIPRA ) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections.

Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nWe purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis.\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n\nReinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n\n## Reinsurance Recoverable\n\nAIG's reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of paid losses recoverable, ceded loss reserves, ceded reserves for unearned premiums, and Life and A nnuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).\n\nAt December 31, 2024, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $38.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $3.8 billion, ceded loss reserves of $29.1 billion including reserves for IBNR claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $4.3 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $0.8 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2024 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. A ctual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we held $20.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reduced profitability associated with lower interest rates, market volatility  and catastrophe losses (including COV ID-19), could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The Reinsurance Credit Department, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM , reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require A IG's reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n\nFor additional information on reinsurance recoverable, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Reinsurance Assets.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n87",

      "answer": "In 2022, AIG's modeled PML estimates net of reinsurance were based on exposures as of October 1, 2021, and reinsurance covers as of December 31, 2021, with catastrophe reinsurance effective as of January 1, 2022.

          "chunk_text": "For General Insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLoss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nUnderwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n\nCatastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n\nSingle Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nReinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n\n## Natural Catastrophe Risk\n\nWe manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n\nWe use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n\nWe perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model inefficiencies, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n\nWe recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. Our internal product development, underwriting, and modeling, will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n\nOur natural catastrophe exposure to primary modeled perils is principally driven by the U.S. and secondarily Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries and perils. We have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and wildfire exposures across multiple countries. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions and significant earthquake exposure in California and the Pacific Northwest regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest region may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions. Additionally, we have significant gross wildfire exposures in California.\n\nThe table below details our modeled estimates of PML, net of reinsurance, on an annual aggregate basis. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the annual aggregate probable maximum losses with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively. Estimates as of December 31, 2021 reflect our in-force portfolio for exposures as of October 1, 2021 and all inuring reinsurance covers as of December 31, 2021, except for the catastrophe reinsurance programs, which are as of January 1, 2022.",

In 2024, the glide path approach continued to guide asset allocation, with the target allocation set for 2025 based on the funded status at December 31, 2024.

The methodology was consistently applied for the respective years in determining the discount rates for the other U.S. pension plans.\n\nIn general, the discount rates for the non-U.S. plans were developed using a similar methodology to the U.S. AIG Retirement plan, by using country-specific Mercer Yield Curves.\n\nThe projected benefit obligation for AIG's Japan pension plans represents approximately 50 percent and 51 percent of the total projected benefit obligations for our non-U.S. pension plans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average discount rate of 0.52 percent and 0.56 percent at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was selected by reference to the Mercer Yield Curve for Japan.\n\n## Plan Assets\n\nThe investment strategy with respect to assets relating to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans is designed to achieve investment returns that will provide for the benefit obligations of the plans over the long term, limit the risk of short-term funding shortfalls and maintain liquidity sufficient to address cash needs. Accordingly, the asset allocation strategy is designed to maximize the investment rate of return while managing various risk factors, including, but not limited to, volatility relative to the benefit obligations, liquidity, and concentration, and incorporates the risk/return profile applicable to each asset class.\n\nThere were no shares of AIG Common Stock included in the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans assets at December 31, 2021 or 2020.\n\n## U.S. Pension Plan\n\nThe assets of the qualified plan are monitored by the AIG U.S. Investment Committee and actively managed by the investment managers, which involves allocating the plan's assets among approved asset classes within ranges as permitted by the strategic allocation. The long-term strategic asset allocation historically has been reviewed and revised approximately every three years. The investment strategy is focused on de-risking the qualified plan via regular monitoring through liability driven investing and the glide path approach, where the glide path defines the target allocation for the 'Return-Seeking' portion of the portfolio (i.e., growth assets) based on the funded ratio and level of interest rates. Under this approach, the allocation to growth assets is reduced and the allocation to liability-hedging assets is increased as the plan's funded ratio increases in accordance with the defined glide path.\n\nThe following table presents the asset allocation percentage by major asset class for the U.S. qualified plan and the target allocation for 2022 based on the plan's funded status at December 31, 2021:\n\n",

      "answer": "AIG's reinsurance recoverable assets increased significantly from 2022 to 2023, then dropped sharply in 2024. In 2022, while specific figures were not disclosed, the narrative indicated that reinsurance was used to mitigate insurance loss exposure, particularly for catastrophic events. By 2023, total reinsurance recoverable assets reached $67.5 billion, including $30.4 billion in ceded loss reserves and $28.2 billion in life reinsurance recoverables. In 2024, this figure dropped to $38.0 billion, with $29.1 billion in ceded loss reserves and only $0.8 billion in life reinsurance recoverables. This volatile trend suggests a substantial reduction in ceded life insurance risk exposure by 2024, potentially indicating a strategic shift or de-risking in the life insurance segment.",

          "chunk_text": "In designing the hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions that are used in projections of future performance of the underlying mutual funds elected by the variable annuity policyholders. We use these assumptions to project future policy level account value changes. We map the mutual funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. Basis risk exists due to the variance between funds returns projected under these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the value of the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic value of the hedge liability target. Net hedge results and the associated cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.\n\nOur hedging programs associated with index annuity and index universal life products, are designed to manage market risk associated with the index crediting strategies offered on these product platforms. These hedging programs are designed to offset the economic risk arising in conjunction with index returns, associated with the crediting strategies that will be occurring during the current crediting rate reset period. Similarly, as with the variable annuities, there are differences between the calculation of the value of the economic liability hedge target and the U.S. GAAP valuation of the index annuity and index universal life embedded derivatives, which can lead to variances in their relative movements.\n\nTo manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic liability hedge targets, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. Each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset corresponding sensitivities in the associated economic hedge targets, within internally defined threshold limits. Since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits. As such, periodic adjustments are made to the hedging portfolio in order to return the net exposure to within the threshold limits.\n\nOur hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions, as well as other hedging instruments. In addition, within the variable annuities hedging program, we purchase certain fixed income securities classified as available for sale. To minimize counterparty credit risk, the majority of the derivative instruments utilized within the hedging programs are cleared through global exchanges. Over the counter derivatives utilized within the hedging programs are subject to two-way collateralization, managed under a net zero collateral threshold.\n\nThe hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic liability hedge targets and the associated derivative portfolios stay within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedging strategies. In addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program's effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. Finally, hedging strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss (Life and Non-Life) exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n\n## Reinsurance markets include:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nTraditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the United States, Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nCapital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nOther insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance.\n\n## The form of reinsurance we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nproportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premiums and losses to reinsurers;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nnon-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nfacultative contracts that reinsure individual policies.\n\nWe continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.",

For the International portfolio, we retained our core attachment points for Japan of $200 million and $125 million for rest of world.\n\nWe have also purchased property per risk covers that provide protection against large losses globally, which include those emanating from non-critical catastrophe events (all events except for named windstorm and earthquake) globally as well as critical catastrophe events (named windstorm and earthquake) outside North America.\n\nActual results in any period are likely to v ary , perhaps materially , from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. For additional information, see also Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures.\n\n## Terrorism Risk\n\nWe actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies' exposures.\n\nOur largest terrorism concentrations are in New Y ork City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers' Compensation lines of business. Our exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization A ct (TRIPRA ) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers certified terrorist attacks within the U.S. or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law.\n\nWe offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nWe purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis.\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n\nReinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n\n## Reinsurance Recoverable\n\nAIG's reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of paid losses recoverable, ceded loss reserves, ceded reserves for unearned premiums, and Life and A nnuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).\n\nAt December 31, 2024, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $38.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $3.8 billion, ceded loss reserves of $29.1 billion including reserves for IBNR claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $4.3 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $0.8 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2024 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. A ctual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we held $20.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reduced profitability associated with lower interest rates, market volatility  and catastrophe losses (including COV ID-19), could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The Reinsurance Credit Department, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM , reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require A IG's reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n\nFor additional information on reinsurance recoverable, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Reinsurance Assets.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n87",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AIG's management of loss reserves risk showed a consistent emphasis on internal controls and external oversight, while also evolving its modeling and analytical approaches. In 2022, AIG highlighted the use of internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, along with reviews by external experts, to manage uncertainty in loss estimation. By 2023, the company expanded its risk management framework to include sensitivity and scenario analyses, stochastic methods, and experience studies as part of its insurance risk measurement toolkit.

          "chunk_text": "For General Insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLoss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nUnderwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n\nCatastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n\nSingle Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nReinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n\n## Natural Catastrophe Risk\n\nWe manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n\nWe use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n\nWe perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model inefficiencies, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n\nWe recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. Our internal product development, underwriting, and modeling, will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n\nOur natural catastrophe exposure to primary modeled perils is principally driven by the U.S. and secondarily Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries and perils. We have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and wildfire exposures across multiple countries. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions and significant earthquake exposure in California and the Pacific Northwest regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest region may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions. Additionally, we have significant gross wildfire exposures in California.\n\nThe table below details our modeled estimates of PML, net of reinsurance, on an annual aggregate basis. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the annual aggregate probable maximum losses with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively. Estimates as of December 31, 2021 reflect our in-force portfolio for exposures as of October 1, 2021 and all inuring reinsurance covers as of December 31, 2021, except for the catastrophe reinsurance programs, which are as of January 1, 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "AIG generates multiple connections and dependencies among its affiliates and legal entities. Financial interconnections are utilized by A IG to support the funding requirements of the business units, optimize group capital deployment within the organization, offer comfort to policyholders, regulators, and rating agencies, provide credit support for higher financial strength ratings, manage exposures, distribute risk appropriately, and meet client or regulatory requirements. To conduct its businesses, AIG relies on operational capabilities of several A IG affiliates and corporate functions. The operational interconnections can be categorized as employees, management information systems, real estate, shared services, and intellectual property.\n\nAIG monitors and reports on the above-mentioned risks through ongoing risk reporting to various committees, monitoring of capital positions, regular interaction with A IG businesses and functions, regulators, and rating agencies. A IG reputational risk protocols are incorporated into the overall risk management framework. On a regular basis, ERM performs Second Line Review and Challenge on many of these processes and approaches, including, but not limited to, budget and expense assumptions, pricing and reserving models, assumptions, and results. The Internal A udit Group performs audits on key processes and provides continuous monitoring on remediation of audit findings. Processes and controls are designed to respond proactively and in some cases, reactively, in an effective and consistent way.\n\n## INSURANCE RISKS\n\nInsurance risk is defined as the risk of actual claims experience and/or policyholder behavior being materially different than initially expected at the inception of an insurance contract. Uncertainties related to insurance risk can lead to deviations in magnitude and/or timing of prospective cash flows associated with our liabilities compared to what we expected.\n\nWe manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A  primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\n\nWe operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of processes and procedures, including but not limited to, pricing and risk selection models, pricing approval processes, pre-launch approval of product design, development, and distribution, underwriting approval processes and authorities, modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels, model risk management framework and validation processes, risk transfer tools, review and challenge of reserves, actuarial profitability  and reserv e rev iews, management of the relationship between assets and liabilities, and experience monitoring and assumption updates.\n\nRisks primarily include loss reserves, underwriting, catastrophe exposure, single risk loss exposure, and reinsurance. The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies, which we manage through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts.

We analyze concentrations of risks using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n85",

      "question": "How has American Express's reliance on aggregators evolved from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to the growing risk of merchant steering and the company's ability to enforce non-discrimination clauses in its merchant contracts?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express increasingly relied on aggregators to manage merchant relationships, but this dependence introduced growing risks tied to merchant steering and inconsistent enforcement of non-discrimination clauses. In 2022, the company acknowledged its reliance on aggregators and processors but warned that their business goals might diverge from its own, potentially undermining card acceptance. By 2023, this concern intensified as AXP noted it had 'increasingly relied' on aggregators and highlighted that new products like debit cards on the American Express network could face discrimination, which could reduce transaction volumes and cards-in-force. In 2024, the risk evolved further, with litigation and regulatory scrutiny around merchant contract provisions becoming more prominent. AXP disclosed exposure to legal actions that could force changes in merchant agreements, exposing cards to increased steering and discrimination. The trajectory shows a growing strategic dependence on aggregators alongside rising operational and legal risks tied to enforcement of card acceptance policies.",

Many of these actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages and require us to incur significant costs for legal representation, arbitration fees or other legal or related services. While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our ex posure to class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future, including as a result of legal challenges to, and new regulations affecting, our arbitration provisions, and claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities, risks and costs associated with class action cases. The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation.\n\nWe expect that financial institutions, such as us, will continue to face significant regulatory scrutiny, with regulators taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non-public supervisory actions or findings, which could involve restrictions on our activities, among other limitations, that could adversely affect our business. In addition, a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us. Further, a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings. External publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries.\n\nWe are also involved at any given time with governmental and regulatory inquiries, investigations and proceedings. Regulatory scrutiny has continued to increase in a number of areas, and regulatory action could subject us to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in Card Member reimbursements, increased expenses, limitations or conditions on our business activities, and damage to our reputation and our brand, all of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. For example, as previously disclosed, we entered into agreements to resolve governmental investigations related to historical sales practices for certain U.S. small business customers, which are described in more detail in Note 12 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements.' In addition, we are cooperating with ongoing regulatory inquiries concerning our rewards and benefits programs, as described in 'Supervision and Regulation' under 'Business.'\n\nLegal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, changes to our merchant agreements and/or business practices, substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand.\n\nWe are, and have been in the past, a defendant in a number of actions, including legal proceedings, arbitrations and proposed class actions, challenging certain provisions of our card acceptance agreements. See Note 12 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for a description of certain outstanding legal proceedings.\n\nAn adverse outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member experience, result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand. Even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements, changes in Visa's and Mastercard's policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings, lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions pending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability. For example, in 2024 Visa and Mastercard proposed a lawsuit settlement agreement that would have, among other things, required reductions and caps on interchange fees and streamlined requirements for merchants who wish to impose a surcharge on credit transactions. While the settlement agreement was not approved by the court, Visa and Mastercard may ultimately agree or be subject to changes in policies or practices that result in greater surcharging generally or downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with reductions and caps on interchange fees.\n\n## We rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business.\n\nWe rely on third-party service providers, cobrand partners, merchants, affiliate marketing firms, processors, aggregators, network partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business. As outsourcing, specialization of functions, third-party digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase (including with respect to mobile technologies, tokenization, big data, artificial intelligence and cloud-based solutions), more third parties are involved in processing card transactions, handling our data and supporting our operations. For example, we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network, card acquisition and provision of services to our customers.\n\nWe have experienced in certain limited circumstances and may continue to experience disruptions or other events at our third parties or our third parties' service providers, including their failure to fulfill their obligations and the information, cybersecurity and operational incidents described above. Such disruptions or other events could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers, impact the confidentiality, integrity, availability and security of our data, lead to fraudulent transactions on our cards or other products, impact our business, cause brand or reputational damage, and lead to costs associated with responding to such a disruption, including notification and remediation costs, costs to switch service providers or move operations in house, regulatory investigations and fines and increased regulatory oversight and litigation. Third parties may face similar or greater risks as us, including as a result of their relationship with us; however, they may be less prepared to mitigate those risks and may be",

When we work with merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage certain aspects of the merchant relationship, we are dependent on them to promote and support the acceptance and usage of our cards, but such third parties may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\n\nNew products, such as debit cards on the American Express network, could fail to gain market acceptance and American Express cards could become less desirable to consumers and businesses generally due to surcharging, steering or other forms of discrimination, which could result in a decrease in cards-in-force and transaction volumes. The impact could vary depending on such factors as: the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied; how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale; the ease and speed of implementation for merchants, including as a result of new or emerging technologies; the size and recurrence of the underlying charges; and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment, including whether it varies depending on the type of card (e.g., credit or debit), product, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business.\n\n## We may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion, merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and services, or to effectively control the costs of such investments, both of which may materially impact our profitability.\n\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, retain existing Card Members and capture a greater share of customers' total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments will continue to be effective, particularly with changing consumer and business behaviors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage or merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards, our business could suffer. Expanding our service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, fail to resonate with customers, adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand.\n\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on third parties for certain redemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future, which could diminish the value of the program for our Card Members. Our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. In addition, many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours. Our inability to differentiate our products and services could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future. If such expenses increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues, decreasing operating expenses or other investments in our business, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment. In addition, increased costs as a result of inflation, colleague retention and recruitment, supply chain issues and shortages of materials such as chips for our cards, and readiness efforts for returning to our offices may require that we reduce investments in other areas.\n\n## Our brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\n\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and realize the benefits of the value of our brand. Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, privacy and data protection, management, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, financial condition, response to political and social issues or catastrophic events (including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters) and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters - even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct-could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members, corporate clients, merchants and partners, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of customer information, conduct by our colleagues and policy engagement, including activities of the American Express Company Political Action Committee, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto. Discussion about such matters in social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand.",

      "question": "How has American Express's competitive positioning and regulatory dependency on card networks evolved from 2022 through 2024, particularly in light of increasing regulatory scrutiny, competitive pressures from other networks, and the exit from certain network licensing businesses?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express maintained its position as the fourth-largest global card network behind China UnionPay, Visa, and Mastercard, but faced increasing regulatory pressure that directly impacted its network business. In 2022 and 2023, the company highlighted intense competition in the premium card space and cobrand relationships, with rivals offering attractive value propositions to high-spending customers and key business partners. In 2024, regulatory scrutiny intensified, particularly around interchange fees, network routing practices, and merchant acceptance terms, leading to American Express exiting its network licensing businesses in the EU and Australia. This regulatory pressure also introduced uncertainty around cobrand arrangements in the EU, signaling a shift from a purely competitive stance to a more compliance-driven dependency on regulatory frameworks. The evolution reveals a growing tension between maintaining competitive differentiation and navigating an increasingly complex global regulatory environment.",

        "Hop 2: [AXP](2024) \u2192 [Card Networks]: AXP becomes more dependent on regulatory navigation, exiting network licensing businesses in the EU and Australia due to regulatory pressures, and facing uncertainty in cobrand arrangements.",
        "Hop 3: [AXP](2022) \u2192 [Card Networks]: AXP competes globally with other card networks and alternative payment platforms, noting increased competition in premium and cobrand segments, and highlighting the importance of innovation and partnerships."

New laws or regulations could similarly affect our business, increase the costs and complexity of doing business, impact what we are able to charge for, or offer in connection with, our products and services, impose conflicting obligations, and require us to change certain of our business practices and invest significant management attention and resources, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Political developments can result in legislative and regulatory uncertainty and changes to supervisory and enforcement priorities. In addition, legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other's approaches to the regulation of the financial services industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another.\n\nIf we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or engage in certain business activities or acquisitions, which could compromise our competitive position. Additionally, our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital. In 2024, we became a Category III firm for purposes of the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies' tailoring framework, resulting in us becoming subject to heightened regulatory expectations and more stringent regulatory requirements. As we continue to grow, these expectations and requirements may further increase, such as if we become a Category II firm, which may increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business.\n\nLegislators and regulators continue to focus on the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard, network routing practices and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. While in some cases our business is subject to exemptions related to certain of these regulations, there is no guarantee that such ex emptions will continue to be available and even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees significantly negatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend, or may extend, to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements, new products or services we may offer, or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-all-cards. For example, we have exited our network licensing businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. See 'Supervision and Regulation - Payments Regulation' under 'Business' for more information. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, a number of federal and state laws to regulate various aspects of network operations are being considered or have passed, including regarding information associated with electronic transactions (such as the use of specific merchant categories codes or limitations on the use of transaction data) and pricing of electronic transactions (such as interchange fees on sales tax  or gratuities).\n\nLegislators and regulators also continue to focus on consumer protection, including product design and pricing constructs, account management and security, credit bureau reporting, disclosure rules, marketing and debt collection practices. This focus has included fees associated with card and banking products, such as a rule issued by the CFPB related to credit card fees for late payments (which is currently stayed); interest rates, such as recent proposals to cap credit card interest rates; rewards programs, such as the recent inquiries by the CFPB and DOT focused on credit card and airline rewards programs; and factors considered by financial institutions in providing services, such as 'fair access' laws. Any new requirements or increased enforcement of existing requirements could materially and adversely impact our revenue growth and profitability, including, as a result of increased scrutiny of our pricing, underwriting and account management practices; the imposition of fines and customer remediation; higher compliance costs; reputational harm; restrictions on our ability to issue cards, appropriately price for the value of our products or work with certain business partners; and changes to our business practices generally.\n\nWe are subject to significant supervision and regulation with respect to compliance with AML/CFT laws, sanctions regimes and anti-corruption laws in numerous jurisdictions. As regulators increase their focus in these areas, new technologies such as digital currencies develop, near real-time money movement solutions are adopted, we introduce new products like checking accounts and geopolitical tensions increase, we face increased costs related to oversight, supervision and potential fines. Our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny, and we are working to make enhancements to our existing programs, policies and procedures and to identify and remediate deficiencies. For example, we recently voluntarily reported certain transactions and accounts to OFAC, some of which related to Iran, as described in 'Supervision and Regulation - Anti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Compliance' under 'Business.' Errors, failures or delays in complying with AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, deficiencies in our related compliance programs or association of our business with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud or other illicit activities or sanctioned persons, entities, governments or countries can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits, which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets, loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities, or other enforcement actions, and our reputation may suffer due to our customers' association with certain countries, persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions. Additionally, our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or affect our relationships with certain partners, service providers and other third parties.\n\nSee 'Supervision and Regulation' under 'Business' for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us.",

The payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies, consumer habits and merchant needs, some of which have accelerated as a result of the pandemic, such as an increased shift to e-commerce and demand for contactless payments.\n\nAs a card issuer, we compete with financial institutions that issue general-purpose credit and debit cards. We also encounter competition from businesses that issue private label cards, operate mobile wallets or extend credit. We face intense competition in the premium space and for cobrand relationships, as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted high-spending customers and key business partners with attractive value propositions. We also face competition for partners and other differentiated offerings, such as lounge space in U.S. and global hub airports.\n\nOur global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks, including, among others, China UnionPay, Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover and Diners Club International (which is owned by Discover). We are the fourth largest general-purpose card network globally based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and Mastercard. In addition to such networks, a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers, processors and web- and mobile-based payment platforms (e.g., Alipay, PayPal and Venmo), as well as regional payment networks (such as the National Payments Corporation of India), carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMNS business.\n\nThe principal competitive factors that affect the card-issuing, merchant and network businesses include:\n\n- The features, value and quality of the products and services, including customer care, rewards programs, partnerships, travel and lifestyle-related benefits, and digital and mobile services, as well as the costs associated with providing such features and services\n- Reputation and brand recognition\n- The number, spending characteristics and credit performance of customers\n- The quantity, diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used\n- The attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers, merchant acquirers, cardholders, corporate clients and merchants (including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services, and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics)\n- The number and quality of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers\n- The success of marketing and promotional campaigns\n- The speed of innovation and investment in systems, technologies, and product and service offerings\n- The nature and quality of expense management tools, electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities, particularly for business customers\n- The security of cardholder, merchant and network partner information\n\nAnother aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products, which include payment aggregators, digital payment and electronic wallet platforms, point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products, real-time settlement and processing systems, financial technology companies, digital currencies developed by both central banks and the private sector, blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies, prepaid systems and gift cards, and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions. Various competitors are integrating more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are seeking to attain the benefits of closed-loop, loyalty and rewards functionalities, such as ours.",

      "question": "How did American Express's investment in Foreign Government Bonds and Obligations evolve from 2022 through 2024 in terms of yield and maturity distribution, and what does this 3-year progression suggest about the company's risk appetite and asset allocation strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, American Express held $630 million in Foreign Government Bonds and Obligations with a weighted average yield of 2.08%, where $628 million was due within one year. In 2023, the yield increased significantly to 6.45% overall, with $6.45 being the weighted average yield on these instruments, most of which were due within one year. By 2024, the yield on these bonds dropped to 5.85%, with a sharp decline in the yield of bonds due after one year (from 4.48% in 2023 to 2.03% in 2024). This 3-year trend shows a volatile yield pattern and a consistent short-term maturity profile in the company's foreign government bond investments, suggesting a cautious but dynamic approach to yield optimization amid changing market conditions.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express's reliance on third-party merchant acquirers has grown, reflecting a strategic shift toward leveraging external partners to expand merchant coverage and facilitate transaction volume, especially among small and mid-sized merchants. In 2022, the company highlighted the role of third-party acquirers under programs like OptBlue and GNS, noting that these relationships allowed American Express to process transactions without direct contracts with merchants, thereby broadening its reach. In 2023, the company emphasized the financial structure of these relationships, detailing how it receives a negotiated network rate fee from third-party acquirers, which is recorded as discount revenue at the time of transaction, reinforcing the financial integration of these partners into American Express\u2019s revenue model. By 2024, the company explicitly stated that its ability to expand merchant coverage globally depended not only on its own efforts but also on the success of third-party merchant acquirers, aggregators, and processors in signing merchants, indicating a deeper strategic dependency on these partners to scale acceptance and usage of American Express cards. This evolution shows a shift from viewing third-party acquirers as supplementary to considering them essential for growth and network expansion.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nAccounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management's assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ.\n\n## INCOME STATEMENT\n\n## Discount Revenue\n\nDiscount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\n\nThe card acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network.\n\nIn cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on behalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other revenue.\n\nRevenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) is not required to be disclosed. Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material.\n\n## Net Card Fees\n\nNet card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore more stable in relation to short term business or economic shifts. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nEffective April 1, 2021, we prospectively changed the recognition of certain costs paid to a third party previously recognized over the twelve month card membership period in Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income; such costs are now recorded as incurred in Marketing and business development expense. This change is not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Fees and Commissions\n\nOther fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other fees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged.

      "question": "How has American Express's strategic positioning relative to alternative payment mechanisms evolved from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of competitive pressure and technological investment, and what does this reveal about the company's long-term resilience in a rapidly digitizing payments landscape?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express (AXP) consistently identified alternative payment mechanisms as a growing competitive threat, with increasing specificity and urgency in its disclosures. In 2022, AXP described alternative payment mechanisms as 'evolving and growing' and listed them as a key competitive force alongside card networks and traditional payment methods. By 2023, the company expanded this view, identifying alternative payment mechanisms as part of a 'dynamic and rapid growth' trend and naming specific technologies such as digital wallets, real-time settlement systems, and blockchain-based solutions. In 2024, AXP shifted from a purely competitive stance to one of dependency and strategic necessity, emphasizing the need to invest in technologies including 'open banking and alternative payment and financing mechanisms' as critical to future competitiveness. This evolution shows AXP transitioning from viewing alternative payment mechanisms as a threat to recognizing the need to integrate and innovate within this space to maintain long-term relevance and resilience.",

Inaccurate perceptions or mischaracterizations of disclosures on these topics, or our goals and initiatives, while outside of our control, could impact our reputation, colleague hiring and retention and public perceptions of our business.\n\n## If we are not able to successfully invest in, and compete with respect to, technological developments and new products and services across all our businesses, our revenue and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in technology across all areas of our business, including in transaction processing, data management and analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, customer interactions and communications, open banking and alternative payment and financing mechanisms, authentication technologies and digital identification, tokenization, real-time settlement and risk management and compliance systems. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services, including developing the appropriate governance and controls consistent with regulatory expectations, requires substantial expenditures and takes considerable time, and may have unintended consequences or ultimately be unsuccessful. We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, our ex isting technology.\n\nThe process of developing new products and services, enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may develop products, platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted by consumers, merchants or service providers than ours, including as a result of increased involvement by technology companies in the payments industry and our competitors' greater scale or ability to pursue and adopt new technologies. In addition, we may underestimate the resources needed and overestimate our ability to develop new products and services, particularly beyond our traditional card products and travel-related services.\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, including generative artificial intelligence, has increased rapidly with the increasing sophistication and applications of the technology. Our and our partners' use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is subject to various risks including flaws in models or datasets that may result in biased or inaccurate results, unintended or unexpected outcomes, ethical considerations regarding artificial intelligence, infringement of intellectual property rights, ex posure of proprietary or personal information, heightened security risks and the ability to safely deploy and implement governance and controls for artificial intelligence systems. The complex ity of these technologies can make it difficult to assess proper operation, reduce error, or understand and explain their outputs. Adverse consequences of artificial intelligence and machine learning remain uncertain but could include flaws in the decisions, predictions, outputs or analysis such technologies produce and subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm.\n\nOur ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the emergence of industry-wide standards, a changing legislative and regulatory environment, an inability to develop appropriate governance and controls, a lack of internal product and engineering expertise, resistance to change from Card Members, merchants or service providers, lack of appropriate change management processes or the complexity of our systems. In addition, our adoption of new technologies and our introduction of new products and services may increase operational complexity and risk, and expose us to new or enhanced risks, particularly in areas where we have less experience or our existing governance and control systems may be insufficient, which could require us to make substantial expenditures or subject us to legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm.\n\n## We may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and investment activity, and our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments, and continue to evaluate potential transactions. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, value potential investment or acquisition opportunities accurately, negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, or complete proposed acquisitions and investments. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including in integrating systems and personnel or further developing the acquired business or technology, result in unanticipated liabilities, including legal claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes and information security vulnerabilities or breaches (including from not integrating the acquired company, business or technology quickly or appropriately, from activities that occurred prior to the acquisition, from inadequate systems or controls of the acquired company, and from exposure to third party relationships of the acquired company or business or new laws and regulations), and harm our business generally. Expanding to new businesses, geographies or customer types through acquisitions may subject us to new risks and we may not have the relevant expertise or business structure to achieve the desired results. It may take us longer than ex pected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results, including as a result of write-downs of goodwill and other intangible assets.",

The payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies, consumer habits and merchant needs, some of which have accelerated as a result of the pandemic, such as an increased shift to e-commerce and demand for contactless payments.\n\nAs a card issuer, we compete with financial institutions that issue general-purpose credit and debit cards. We also encounter competition from businesses that issue private label cards, operate mobile wallets or extend credit. We face intense competition in the premium space and for cobrand relationships, as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted high-spending customers and key business partners with attractive value propositions. We also face competition for partners and other differentiated offerings, such as lounge space in U.S. and global hub airports.\n\nOur global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks, including, among others, China UnionPay, Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover and Diners Club International (which is owned by Discover). We are the fourth largest general-purpose card network globally based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and Mastercard. In addition to such networks, a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers, processors and web- and mobile-based payment platforms (e.g., Alipay, PayPal and Venmo), as well as regional payment networks (such as the National Payments Corporation of India), carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMNS business.\n\nThe principal competitive factors that affect the card-issuing, merchant and network businesses include:\n\n- The features, value and quality of the products and services, including customer care, rewards programs, partnerships, travel and lifestyle-related benefits, and digital and mobile services, as well as the costs associated with providing such features and services\n- Reputation and brand recognition\n- The number, spending characteristics and credit performance of customers\n- The quantity, diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used\n- The attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers, merchant acquirers, cardholders, corporate clients and merchants (including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services, and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics)\n- The number and quality of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers\n- The success of marketing and promotional campaigns\n- The speed of innovation and investment in systems, technologies, and product and service offerings\n- The nature and quality of expense management tools, electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities, particularly for business customers\n- The security of cardholder, merchant and network partner information\n\nAnother aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products, which include payment aggregators, digital payment and electronic wallet platforms, point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products, real-time settlement and processing systems, financial technology companies, digital currencies developed by both central banks and the private sector, blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies, prepaid systems and gift cards, and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions. Various competitors are integrating more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are seeking to attain the benefits of closed-loop, loyalty and rewards functionalities, such as ours.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AIG's international terrorism exposure management evolved with increasing sophistication in scenario modeling, expanded reinsurance protections, and refined geographic attachment points. In 2022, AIG modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack in New York City net of TRIPRA and reinsurance, estimating a $1.3 billion loss. In 2023, AIG maintained a focus on scenario-based modeling and highlighted its participation in international terrorism pools and targeted reinsurance purchases. By 2024, AIG had retained core attachment points of $200 million for Japan and $125 million for the rest of the world, indicating a more structured and region-specific approach to international terrorism risk. This progression shows a strategic shift from reactive modeling to proactive geographic risk segmentation and enhanced reinsurance structuring.",

For the International portfolio, we retained our core attachment points for Japan of $200 million and $125 million for rest of world.\n\nWe have also purchased property per risk covers that provide protection against large losses globally, which include those emanating from non-critical catastrophe events (all events except for named windstorm and earthquake) globally as well as critical catastrophe events (named windstorm and earthquake) outside North America.\n\nActual results in any period are likely to v ary , perhaps materially , from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. For additional information, see also Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures.\n\n## Terrorism Risk\n\nWe actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies' exposures.\n\nOur largest terrorism concentrations are in New Y ork City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers' Compensation lines of business. Our exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization A ct (TRIPRA ) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers certified terrorist attacks within the U.S. or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law.\n\nWe offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nWe purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis.\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n\nReinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n\n## Reinsurance Recoverable\n\nAIG's reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of paid losses recoverable, ceded loss reserves, ceded reserves for unearned premiums, and Life and A nnuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).\n\nAt December 31, 2024, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $38.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $3.8 billion, ceded loss reserves of $29.1 billion including reserves for IBNR claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $4.3 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $0.8 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2024 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. A ctual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we held $20.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reduced profitability associated with lower interest rates, market volatility  and catastrophe losses (including COV ID-19), could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The Reinsurance Credit Department, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM , reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require A IG's reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n\nFor additional information on reinsurance recoverable, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Reinsurance Assets.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n87",

Further to the occurrence protection, there is $175 million of limit in excess of a $350 million retention (subject to per event caps) placed on a worldwide aggregate excess of loss cover and $400 million of limit excess $550 million on an aggregate index basis via the renewed Tailwind Re Cat Bond which covers U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada named storm losses.\n\nActual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\n\nFor additional information see also Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures.\n\n## Terrorism Risk\n\nWe actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. We have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies' exposures. Examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.\n\nOur largest terrorism concentrations are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers' Compensation lines of business. At our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $1.3 billion based on the exposures as of October 1, 2021.\n\nOur exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by TRIPRA in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers certified terrorist attacks within the United States or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. In 2021, TRIPRA covers 80 percent of insured losses above a deductible. The current estimate of our deductible is approximately $1.7 billion for 2021.\n\nWe offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Life and Retirement Companies' Key Risks\n\nWe manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing and underwriting discipline, risk limits and thresholds, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the alignment between risk and cash flow profiles of assets and liabilities, and hedging instruments.\n\nFor Life and Retirement companies, risks include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLongevity risk -represents the risk of an increase in liabilities associated with an insurance product, e.g. an annuity policy or a payout benefit as a result of actual mortality experience being lower than the expected mortality experience. This risk could arise from medical advancement and longer-term societal health changes. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our annuity products.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nMorbidity risk - represents the risk arising from actual morbidity (e.g. illness, disability or disease) incidence rate being higher than expected or the length of the claims extending longer than expected resulting in a higher overall benefit payout. This risk could arise from longer-term medical advances in detection and treatment for various diseases and medical conditions resulting in higher claim amounts.

      "answer": "AIG's modeled PML estimates for 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 annual aggregate catastrophic events increased from 2022 to 2024, indicating a growing exposure to natural catastrophe risk. In 2022, the PMLs were based on the in-force portfolio as of October 1, 2021, and reinsurance covers as of January 1, 2022. By 2023, the estimates were updated to reflect the in-force portfolio as of October 1, 2023, and reinsurance programs as of January 1, 2024. In 2024, the modeled losses were based on the in-force portfolio as of July 1, 2024, and reinsurance programs as of January 1, 2025. The consistent updates and likely increases in modeled losses suggest that AIG's exposure to catastrophic events has grown or become more complex, requiring ongoing adaptation in risk modeling, underwriting, and reinsurance strategies.",

          "chunk_text": "For General Insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLoss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nUnderwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n\nCatastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n\nSingle Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nReinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n\n## Natural Catastrophe Risk\n\nWe manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n\nWe use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n\nWe perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model inefficiencies, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n\nWe recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. Our internal product development, underwriting, and modeling, will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n\nOur natural catastrophe exposure to primary modeled perils is principally driven by the U.S. and secondarily Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries and perils. We have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and wildfire exposures across multiple countries. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions and significant earthquake exposure in California and the Pacific Northwest regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest region may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions. Additionally, we have significant gross wildfire exposures in California.\n\nThe table below details our modeled estimates of PML, net of reinsurance, on an annual aggregate basis. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the annual aggregate probable maximum losses with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively. Estimates as of December 31, 2021 reflect our in-force portfolio for exposures as of October 1, 2021 and all inuring reinsurance covers as of December 31, 2021, except for the catastrophe reinsurance programs, which are as of January 1, 2022.",

The discount rates were 2.75 percent at December 31, 2021 and 2.28 percent at December 31, 2020. The methodology was consistently applied for the respective years in determining the discount rates for the other U.S. pension plans.\n\nIn general, the discount rates for the non-U.S. plans were developed using a similar methodology to the U.S. AIG Retirement plan, by using country-specific Mercer Yield Curves.\n\nThe projected benefit obligation for AIG's Japan pension plans represents approximately 50 percent and 51 percent of the total projected benefit obligations for our non-U.S. pension plans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average discount rate of 0.52 percent and 0.56 percent at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was selected by reference to the Mercer Yield Curve for Japan.\n\n## Plan Assets\n\nThe investment strategy with respect to assets relating to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans is designed to achieve investment returns that will provide for the benefit obligations of the plans over the long term, limit the risk of short-term funding shortfalls and maintain liquidity sufficient to address cash needs. Accordingly, the asset allocation strategy is designed to maximize the investment rate of return while managing various risk factors, including, but not limited to, volatility relative to the benefit obligations, liquidity, and concentration, and incorporates the risk/return profile applicable to each asset class.\n\nThere were no shares of AIG Common Stock included in the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans assets at December 31, 2021 or 2020.\n\n## U.S. Pension Plan\n\nThe assets of the qualified plan are monitored by the AIG U.S. Investment Committee and actively managed by the investment managers, which involves allocating the plan's assets among approved asset classes within ranges as permitted by the strategic allocation.

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, AIG's reinsurance recoverable assets related to insurance loss exposure decreased significantly, from an unspecified but implied substantial amount in 2022 (based on the detailed discussion of reinsurance usage), to $67.5 billion in 2023, and further down to $38.0 billion in 2024. This downward trend indicates a strategic shift in how AIG managed its insurance loss exposure over the three-year period. In 2022, AIG emphasized the use of reinsurance to mitigate insurance loss exposure related to natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, and single policy level events. By 2023, the company had a robust reinsurance recoverable portfolio totaling $67.5 billion, including $30.4 billion in ceded loss reserves and $28.2 billion in life reinsurance recoverables, showing active risk transfer. However, by 2024, the total reinsurance recoverable had dropped to $38.0 billion, with life reinsurance recoverable plummeting to just $0.8 billion, suggesting either a reduction in ceded risk, a change in reinsurance strategy, or successful claims resolution. This trajectory implies that AIG may have either retained more risk internally, reduced its underwriting exposure, or optimized its reinsurance programs to achieve similar risk protection at a lower ceded reserve level.",

          "chunk_text": "enhancements. For the International portfolio, we retained our core attachment points for Japan of $200 million and $125 million for rest of world.\n\nWe have also purchased property per risk covers that provide protection against large losses globally, which include those emanating from non-critical catastrophe events (all events except for named windstorm and earthquake) globally as well as critical catastrophe events (named windstorm and earthquake) outside North America.\n\nActual results in any period are likely to v ary , perhaps materially , from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. For additional information, see also Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures.\n\n## Terrorism Risk\n\nWe actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies' exposures.\n\nOur largest terrorism concentrations are in New Y ork City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers' Compensation lines of business. Our exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization A ct (TRIPRA ) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers certified terrorist attacks within the U.S. or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law.\n\nWe offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nWe purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis.\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n\nReinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n\n## Reinsurance Recoverable\n\nAIG's reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of paid losses recoverable, ceded loss reserves, ceded reserves for unearned premiums, and Life and A nnuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).\n\nAt December 31, 2024, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $38.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $3.8 billion, ceded loss reserves of $29.1 billion including reserves for IBNR claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $4.3 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $0.8 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2024 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. A ctual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we held $20.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reduced profitability associated with lower interest rates, market volatility  and catastrophe losses (including COV ID-19), could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The Reinsurance Credit Department, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM , reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require A IG's reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n\nFor additional information on reinsurance recoverable, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Reinsurance Assets.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n87",

          "chunk_text": "In designing the hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions that are used in projections of future performance of the underlying mutual funds elected by the variable annuity policyholders. We use these assumptions to project future policy level account value changes. We map the mutual funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. Basis risk exists due to the variance between funds returns projected under these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the value of the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic value of the hedge liability target. Net hedge results and the associated cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.\n\nOur hedging programs associated with index annuity and index universal life products, are designed to manage market risk associated with the index crediting strategies offered on these product platforms. These hedging programs are designed to offset the economic risk arising in conjunction with index returns, associated with the crediting strategies that will be occurring during the current crediting rate reset period. Similarly, as with the variable annuities, there are differences between the calculation of the value of the economic liability hedge target and the U.S. GAAP valuation of the index annuity and index universal life embedded derivatives, which can lead to variances in their relative movements.\n\nTo manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic liability hedge targets, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. Each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset corresponding sensitivities in the associated economic hedge targets, within internally defined threshold limits. Since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits. As such, periodic adjustments are made to the hedging portfolio in order to return the net exposure to within the threshold limits.\n\nOur hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions, as well as other hedging instruments. In addition, within the variable annuities hedging program, we purchase certain fixed income securities classified as available for sale. To minimize counterparty credit risk, the majority of the derivative instruments utilized within the hedging programs are cleared through global exchanges. Over the counter derivatives utilized within the hedging programs are subject to two-way collateralization, managed under a net zero collateral threshold.\n\nThe hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic liability hedge targets and the associated derivative portfolios stay within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedging strategies. In addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program's effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. Finally, hedging strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss (Life and Non-Life) exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events.

In 2022, AIG highlighted the uncertainty in loss development and the use of internal controls and external reviews to manage this risk. By 2023, AIG expanded its risk management framework to include detailed modeling techniques (both stochastic and deterministic) for analyzing risk concentrations and introduced more formalized actuarial profitability and reserve reviews. In 2024, AIG reinforced its multi-tiered risk oversight by incorporating ERM second-line reviews, enhanced budget and expense assumption monitoring, and continued reliance on external experts, indicating a maturing and increasingly proactive approach to loss reserve risk management.",

          "chunk_text": "AIG generates multiple connections and dependencies among its affiliates and legal entities. Financial interconnections are utilized by A IG to support the funding requirements of the business units, optimize group capital deployment within the organization, offer comfort to policyholders, regulators, and rating agencies, provide credit support for higher financial strength ratings, manage exposures, distribute risk appropriately, and meet client or regulatory requirements. To conduct its businesses, AIG relies on operational capabilities of several A IG affiliates and corporate functions. The operational interconnections can be categorized as employees, management information systems, real estate, shared services, and intellectual property.\n\nAIG monitors and reports on the above-mentioned risks through ongoing risk reporting to various committees, monitoring of capital positions, regular interaction with A IG businesses and functions, regulators, and rating agencies. A IG reputational risk protocols are incorporated into the overall risk management framework. On a regular basis, ERM performs Second Line Review and Challenge on many of these processes and approaches, including, but not limited to, budget and expense assumptions, pricing and reserving models, assumptions, and results. The Internal A udit Group performs audits on key processes and provides continuous monitoring on remediation of audit findings. Processes and controls are designed to respond proactively and in some cases, reactively, in an effective and consistent way.\n\n## INSURANCE RISKS\n\nInsurance risk is defined as the risk of actual claims experience and/or policyholder behavior being materially different than initially expected at the inception of an insurance contract. Uncertainties related to insurance risk can lead to deviations in magnitude and/or timing of prospective cash flows associated with our liabilities compared to what we expected.\n\nWe manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A  primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\n\nWe operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of processes and procedures, including but not limited to, pricing and risk selection models, pricing approval processes, pre-launch approval of product design, development, and distribution, underwriting approval processes and authorities, modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels, model risk management framework and validation processes, risk transfer tools, review and challenge of reserves, actuarial profitability  and reserv e rev iews, management of the relationship between assets and liabilities, and experience monitoring and assumption updates.\n\nRisks primarily include loss reserves, underwriting, catastrophe exposure, single risk loss exposure, and reinsurance. The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies, which we manage through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nThe potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit.\n\nOur business is exposed to various catastrophic events, including natural disasters, man-made catastrophes, or pandemic disease, in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year, adversely affecting our business and operating results. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n\nOur business is exposed to loss events, such as fires or explosions, that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance.\n\nSince we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the recoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability  or unwillingness to pay , contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated, which is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n\nWe closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each underwritten line of business, concentrations in industries, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. We analyze concentrations of risks using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n85",

          "chunk_text": "For General Insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLoss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nUnderwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n\nCatastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n\nSingle Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nReinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n\n## Natural Catastrophe Risk\n\nWe manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n\nWe use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n\nWe perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model inefficiencies, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n\nWe recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. Our internal product development, underwriting, and modeling, will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n\nOur natural catastrophe exposure to primary modeled perils is principally driven by the U.S. and secondarily Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries and perils. We have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and wildfire exposures across multiple countries. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions and significant earthquake exposure in California and the Pacific Northwest regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest region may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions. Additionally, we have significant gross wildfire exposures in California.\n\nThe table below details our modeled estimates of PML, net of reinsurance, on an annual aggregate basis. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the annual aggregate probable maximum losses with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively. Estimates as of December 31, 2021 reflect our in-force portfolio for exposures as of October 1, 2021 and all inuring reinsurance covers as of December 31, 2021, except for the catastrophe reinsurance programs, which are as of January 1, 2022.",

      "question": "How did BNY Mellon's disclosures about constraints on capital returns to shareholders under U.S. banking laws evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to regulatory requirements, dividend policies, and capital adequacy?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, BNY Mellon consistently highlighted that its ability to return capital to shareholders was limited by U.S. banking laws and regulations, including capital adequacy rules and Delaware law. In 2022, the firm emphasized that capital returns were subject to regulatory approval and could be constrained by failure to pay preferred dividends on time. In 2023, the language remained largely consistent, but the firm expanded its risk discussion to include ESG-related regulatory pressures and the impact of new strategic initiatives on capital allocation. By 2024, the disclosures remained centered on regulatory constraints, with additional emphasis on the Parent company\u2019s reliance on subsidiary dividends and the potential impact of strategic transformation initiatives on liquidity and capital planning. The trend shows a stable regulatory framework with increasing contextual complexity around capital return limitations.",

        "Hop 1: [BK](2022) \u2192 [U.S. Banking Laws]: Disclosed that capital returns were limited by U.S. banking laws, capital planning rules, and Delaware law, particularly if preferred dividends were not paid timely.",
        "Hop 2: [BK](2023) \u2192 [U.S. Banking Laws]: Reiterated capital return constraints under U.S. banking laws, while also introducing ESG-related regulatory risks and new strategic initiatives as potential influences.",
        "Hop 3: [BK](2024) \u2192 [U.S. Banking Laws]: Continued to cite U.S. banking laws as a limiting factor on capital returns, with added focus on the Parent company\u2019s dependency on subsidiary dividends and transformational initiatives affecting liquidity."

In 2023, the structure remained largely consistent, with the policy referenced in the same Proxy section, indicating no major changes in its disclosure framework. By 2024, BK continued to reference the same policy in the same Proxy section, suggesting a stable and consistent approach to related party transaction disclosures over the three-year period.

      "question": "How did Schwab's use and pledging of client securities evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to margin lending and securities lending activities, and what does this trend indicate about the firm's collateral management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab disclosed that clients with margin loans allowed the firm to pledge collateralized securities in accordance with federal regulations, though no specific dollar value was provided for the total available or pledged securities. In 2023, Schwab expanded on this by detailing that collateralized securities were used in margin lending and were not reflected in the consolidated financial statements, indicating a more formalized and possibly scaled-up collateral management process. By 2024, Schwab was actively pledging client securities to satisfy margin requirements for listed option contracts cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation and was providing cash as collateral in securities lending activities, showing a strategic evolution toward broader use of client assets for operational and regulatory needs. This 3-year progression reflects a growing reliance on client securities for risk mitigation and capital efficiency, while maintaining regulatory compliance.",

We satisfy the margin requirements of these transactions through pledging certain client securities. For additional information on these pledged securities, refer to Note 18. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The Company satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral.\n\nThe Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. The Company's liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the amounts it has posted as collateral. The Company also engages third-party firms to clear clients' futures and options on futures transactions and to facilitate clients' foreign ex change trading, and has agreed to indemnify these firms for any losses that they may incur from the client transactions introduced to them by the Company. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees and indemnifications.\n\nIDA agreement: On May 4, 2023, the Company executed the 2023 IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions that replaced and superseded the previous agreement dated November 24, 2019, as amended. The 2023 IDA agreement specifies responsibilities, including certain contingent obligations, of the Company going forward. Pursuant to the 2023 IDA agreement, uninvested cash within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. The Company's ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent on multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and certain binding limitations specified in the 2023 IDA agreement. During 2024, Schwab did not move IDA balances to its balance sheet.\n\nThe 2023 IDA agreement extends the agreement term to sweep balances to the TD Depository Institutions through July 1, 2034, and requires that Schwab maintain minimum and maximum IDA balances as follows:\n\n- Through September 10, 2025, Schwab must maintain minimum balances above the total of then-outstanding unmatured fixed-rate obligation amounts, with a maximum of $30 billion above this total amount.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Schwab consistently provided interactive tools for RIAs through its Advisor Services website, but the platform matured in terms of capabilities and integration. In 2022, Schwab offered proprietary software for RIAs to access client account information and trading capabilities, along with integrations with third-party platforms for CRM, portfolio management, and financial planning. By 2023, Schwab had expanded these offerings to include tools like Schwab Advisor Portfolio Connect, a free portfolio management solution delivering an intuitive modern experience without the need for data reconciliation.

The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs.\n\nWe manage compliance risk through policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, privacy, and employment policies.\n\nPrivacy risk is the risk of unauthorized collection, use, storage, or sharing of personal information, including data incidents and other mismanagement of personal information. We manage privacy risk through policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with these laws and regulations.\n\nAnti-money laundering/sanctions risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)/global sanctions (collectively, 'AML') laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Schwab manages this risk through daily monitoring, a system of internal controls, education and training for appropriate personnel, and developing risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence and complying with beneficial ownership requirements for legal entity customers.\n\nConduct risk arises from inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior of the Company, its employees or third parties acting on the Company's behalf that may result in detriment to the Company's clients, financial markets, the Company, and/or the Company's employees. We manage this risk through policies, procedures, a system of internal controls, including personnel monitoring and surveillance. Conduct-related matters are escalated through appropriate channels by the Company's Corporate Responsibility Officer.\n\nFiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. We manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.\n\nIncentive Compensation risk is the potential for adverse consequences resulting from compensation plans that do not balance the execution of our strategy with risk and financial rewards, potentially encouraging imprudent risk-taking by employees. We have implemented risk management processes, including a policy, to identify, evaluate, assess, and manage risks associated with incentive compensation plans and the activities of certain employees, defined as Covered Employees, who have the authority to ex pose the Company to material amounts of risk.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. Our ex posure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios, mortgage lending, margin lending and client option and futures activities, pledged asset lending, securities lending activities, and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts. To manage the risks of such losses, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting and reviewing credit limits, monitoring credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, PAL, option, and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments.\n\n## Liquidity and Investment Portfolios\n\nSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.",

U.S. agency mortgagebacked securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.\n\n## Mortgage Lending Portfolio\n\nThe bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs (discussed below), and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses.\n\nOur residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo).\n\nSchwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. For more information on credit quality indicators relating to Schwab's bank loans, see Item 8 - Note 7.\n\n## Securities and Instrument-Based Lending Portfolios\n\nCollateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option and futures positions, securities lending agreements, and securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements) include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations. Additionally, for margin loans, PALs, options and futures positions, and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position.\n\n## Other Counterparty Exposures\n\nSchwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab's clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to the Company.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nMarket risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by Schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. Schwab is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates within our interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets.\n\nTo manage interest rate risk, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity (EVE) risk. To remain within these limits, we manage the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Management monitors established guidelines to stay within the Company's risk appetite.\n\nOur measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue, bank deposit account fees, or EVE. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes,",

      "question": "How did Schwab's ability to migrate IDA balances to its balance sheet evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what were the key changes in migration limits and balance requirements under the IDA agreements during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab had the option under the 2019 IDA agreement to migrate up to $10 billion of IDA balances annually to its balance sheet, subject to limitations, and had already moved $10.1 billion by year-end. In 2023, under the newly executed 2023 IDA agreement, Schwab no longer exercised this migration option and was instead bound by new minimum and maximum balance thresholds. By 2024, Schwab continued to operate under the 2023 IDA agreement and did not move any IDA balances to its balance sheet, reflecting a strategic shift toward maintaining off-balance sheet deposits under stricter constraints. This evolution shows a transition from active migration to constrained off-balance sheet management.",

We satisfy the margin requirements of these transactions through pledging certain client securities. For additional information on these pledged securities, refer to Note 18. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The Company satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral.\n\nThe Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. The Company's liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the amounts it has posted as collateral. The Company also engages third-party firms to clear clients' futures and options on futures transactions and to facilitate clients' foreign ex change trading, and has agreed to indemnify these firms for any losses that they may incur from the client transactions introduced to them by the Company. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees and indemnifications.\n\nIDA agreement: On May 4, 2023, the Company executed the 2023 IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions that replaced and superseded the previous agreement dated November 24, 2019, as amended. The 2023 IDA agreement specifies responsibilities, including certain contingent obligations, of the Company going forward. Pursuant to the 2023 IDA agreement, uninvested cash within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. The Company's ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent on multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and certain binding limitations specified in the 2023 IDA agreement. During 2024, Schwab did not move IDA balances to its balance sheet.\n\nThe 2023 IDA agreement extends the agreement term to sweep balances to the TD Depository Institutions through July 1, 2034, and requires that Schwab maintain minimum and maximum IDA balances as follows:\n\n- Through September 10, 2025, Schwab must maintain minimum balances above the total of then-outstanding unmatured fixed-rate obligation amounts, with a maximum of $30 billion above this total amount.

We partially satisfy the margin requirements by arranging unsecured standby LOCs, in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation, which are issued by several banks. At December 31, 2021, the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $15 million. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs at December 31, 2021. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The Company satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral.\n\nThe Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members.

The IDA agreement creates responsibilities of the Company and certain contingent obligations. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, uninvested cash within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. Though unlikely, in the event the sweep arrangement fee computation were to result in a negative amount in any given month, Schwab would be required to pay the TD Depository Institutions.\n\nThe IDA agreement also provides that, as of July 1, 2021, Schwab has the option to migrate up to $10 billion of IDA balances every 12 months to Schwab's balance sheet, subject to certain limitations and adjustments. The Company's ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent upon multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and certain binding limitations specified in the IDA agreement, including the requirement that Schwab can only move IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations. In addition, Schwab also must maintain a minimum $50 billion IDA balance through June 2031, and at least 80% of the IDA balances must be designated as fixed-rate obligations through June 2026.\n\nThe total ending IDA balance was $147.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, and $154.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. Were IDA balances to decline below the required IDA balance minimum, Schwab could be required to direct additional sweep cash from its balance sheet to the IDA program. Through December 31, 2021, Schwab had moved $10.1 billion of IDA balances to its balance sheet, which included uninsured balances and certain international account balances. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, the Company moved approximately $10 billion of additional IDA balances to its balance sheet.",

      "answer": "MetLife's net ceded reinsurance recoverables tied to the modified coinsurance agreement increased significantly from $6.1 billion in 2022 to $16.7 billion in 2023, and further to $17.6 billion in 2024. This indicates a growing reliance on reinsurance to manage risk, particularly through the closed block, with a consistent 59% cession under the modified coinsurance agreement across all three years. The proportion of recoverables concentrated among the top five reinsurers also increased from 69% in 2023 (down from 64% in 2022) to 84% in both 2023 and 2024, signaling a strategic shift toward greater concentration with fewer, larger reinsurers.

Excess  of retention  reinsurance  agreements  provide  for  a  portion  of  a  risk  to  remain  with  the  direct  writing  company  and  quota  share reinsurance agreements provide for the direct writing company to transfer a fixed percentage of all risks of a class of policies.\n\n## Reinsurance Recoverables\n\nThe Company reinsures its business through a diversified group of well-capitalized reinsurers.

See  '-  Insurance  Liabilities'  regarding  the  source  and  uncertainties  associated  with  the estimation of the contractual obligations related to future policy benefits and policyholder account balances.\n\nThe sum of the estimated cash flows of $248.6 billion ($29.5 billion of which are estimated to occur in one year or less) exceeds the liability amount of $203.5 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.\n\nThe estimated cash flows represent cash payments undiscounted as to interest and including assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and deposits; withdrawals, including unscheduled or partial withdrawals; policy lapses; surrender charges;  annuitization;  mortality;  future  interest  credited;  policy  loans  and  other  contingent  events  as  appropriate  for  the respective  product  type.  Such  estimated  cash  payments  are  also  presented  net  of  estimated  future  premiums  on  policies currently  in-force  and  gross  of  any  reinsurance  recoverable.  For  obligations  denominated  in  foreign  currencies,  cash payments have been estimated using current spot foreign currency rates.",

      "answer": "MetLife's investment in operating joint ventures showed a decline from $51 million in 2022 to $38 million in 2023, followed by a significant increase to $175 million in 2024. The associated equity method net investment income also followed a similar trend, starting at $1,305 million in 2022, dropping sharply to $151 million in 2023, and then rising again to $988 million in 2024. This trajectory reveals a notable fluctuation in both the investment value and the income generated from these ventures across the three-year period.",

Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n\n## Other Invested Assets\n\nOther invested assets consist principally of the following:\n\n- Freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values which are described in '- Derivatives' below.\n- Tax credit and renewable energy partnerships which derive a significant source of investment return in the form of income tax  credits  or  other  tax  incentives.  Where  tax  credits  are  guaranteed  by  a  creditworthy  third  party,  the  investment  is accounted for under the effective yield method. Otherwise, the investment is accounted for under the equity method. See Note 19.\n- Annuities funding structured settlement claims represent annuities funding claims assumed by the Company in its capacity as  a  structured  settlements  assignment  company.  The  annuities  are  stated  at  their  contract  value,  which  represents  the present  value  of  the  future  periodic  claim  payments  to  be  provided. The  net  investment  income  recognized  reflects  the amortization of discount of the annuity at its implied effective interest rate.\n- Direct financing leases net investment is equal to the minimum lease payment receivables plus the unguaranteed residual value,  less  the  unearned  income,  less ACL.  Income  is  recognized  by  applying  the  pre-tax  internal  rate  of  return  to  the investment balance. The Company regularly reviews its minimum lease payment receivables for credit loss and residual value for impairments. Certain direct financing leases are linked to inflation.\n- Leveraged leases net investment is equal to the minimum lease payment receivables plus the unguaranteed residual value, less  the  unearned  income,  less  ACL  and  is  reported  net  of  non-recourse  debt.  Income  is  recognized  by  applying  the leveraged lease's estimated rate of return to the net investment in the lease in those periods in which the net investment at the beginning of the period is positive. Leveraged leases derive investment returns in part from their income tax benefit. The Company regularly reviews its minimum lease payment receivables for credit loss and residual value for impairments.\n- Investments in operating joint ventures that engage in insurance underwriting activities are accounted for under the equity method.\n- Investments in Federal Home Loan Bank ('FHLB') common stock are carried at redemption value and are considered restricted  investments  until  redeemed  by  the  respective  regional  FHLBs.  Dividends  are  recognized  in  net  investment income when declared.\n- Funds  withheld  represent  a  receivable  for  amounts  contractually  withheld  by  ceding  companies  in  accordance  with reinsurance agreements. The Company recognizes interest on funds withheld at rates defined by the terms of the agreement which may be contractually specified or directly related to the underlying investments.\n\n## Securities Lending Transactions and Repurchase Agreements\n\nThe Company accounts for securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements as financing arrangements and the associated  liability  is  recorded  at  the  amount  of  cash  received.  The  securities  loaned  or  sold  under  these  agreements  are included in invested assets. Income and expenses associated with securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements are recognized as investment income and investment expense, respectively, within net investment income.\n\n## Securities Lending Transactions\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  securities  lending  transactions,  whereby  securities  are  loaned  to  unaffiliated  financial institutions. The Company obtains collateral at the inception of the loan, usually cash, in an amount generally equal to 102% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, and maintains it at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the duration of the loan. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. The Company is liable to return to the counterparties the cash collateral received. Security collateral on deposit from counterparties in connection with securities lending transactions may not be sold or re-pledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not reflected on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company monitors the ratio of the collateral held to the estimated fair value of the securities loaned on a daily basis and additional collateral is obtained as necessary throughout the duration of the loan.",

      "question": "How did MetLife's use of the deposit method of accounting for reinsurance evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of deposit assets and liabilities, and how does the 2023 Global Atlantic reinsurance transaction reflect a strategic shift in this accounting approach?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, MetLife's use of the deposit method of accounting for reinsurance showed a significant increase in both deposit assets and liabilities. In 2022, deposit assets and liabilities were $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. By 2023, deposit assets rose to $5.1 billion and liabilities to $1.3 billion. In 2024, deposit assets slightly decreased to $4.6 billion while liabilities remained stable at $1.2 billion. The 2023 Global Atlantic transaction marked a strategic shift, as MetLife recorded $10.3 billion in reinsurance recoverables and deposit receivables, indicating a more aggressive use of the deposit method to manage risk exposure and restructure its life insurance portfolio.",

        "Hop 2: MET(2023) \u2192 Deposit Method of Accounting: The Global Atlantic transaction introduced a significant increase in deposit assets to $5.1 billion and liabilities to $1.3 billion, showing a strategic expansion in the use of the deposit method.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)\n\n## 6. Reinsurance (continued)\n\nReinsurance agreements that do not expose the Company to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk are recorded using the deposit method of accounting. The deposit assets on reinsurance were $1.8 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. The deposit liabilities on reinsurance were $1.4 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## 7. Closed Block\n\nOn April 7, 2000 (the 'Demutualization Date'), Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ('MLIC') converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. The conversion was pursuant to an order by the New York Superintendent of Insurance approving MLIC's plan of reorganization, as amended (the 'Plan of Reorganization'). On the Demutualization Date, MLIC established a closed block for the benefit of holders of certain individual life insurance policies of MLIC. Assets have been allocated to the closed block in an amount that has been determined to produce cash flows which, together with anticipated revenues from the policies included in the closed block, are reasonably expected to be sufficient to support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies, including, but not limited to, provisions for the payment of claims and certain expenses and taxes, and to provide for the continuation of policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999, if the experience underlying such dividend scales continues, and for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience changes. At least annually, the Company compares actual and projected experience against the experience assumed in the then-current dividend scales. Dividend scales are adjusted periodically to give effect to changes in experience.\n\nThe closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed block assets and the anticipated revenues from the policies in the closed block will benefit only the holders of the policies in the closed block. To the extent that, over time, cash flows from the assets allocated to the closed block and claims and other experience related to the closed block are, in the aggregate, more or less favorable than what was assumed when the closed block was established, total dividends paid to closed block policyholders in the future  may be greater than or less than the total dividends that would have been paid to these policyholders if the policyholder dividend  scales  in  effect  for  1999  had  been  continued.  Any  cash  flows  in  excess  of  amounts  assumed  will  be  available  for distribution over time to closed block policyholders and will not be available to stockholders. If the closed block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets outside of the closed block. The closed block will continue in effect as long as any policy in the closed block remains in-force. The expected life of the closed block is over 100 years from the Demutualization Date.\n\nThe Company uses the same accounting principles to account for the participating policies included in the closed block as it used prior to the Demutualization Date. However, the Company establishes a policyholder dividend obligation for earnings that will be paid to policyholders as additional dividends as described below. The excess of closed block liabilities over closed block assets at the Demutualization Date (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in AOCI) represents the estimated maximum future earnings from the closed block expected to result from operations, attributed net of income tax, to the closed block. Earnings of the closed block are recognized in income over the period the policies and contracts in the closed block remain in-force. Management believes  that  over  time  the  actual  cumulative  earnings  of  the  closed  block  will  approximately  equal  the  expected  cumulative earnings  due  to  the  effect  of  dividend  changes.  If,  over  the  period  the  closed  block  remains  in  existence,  the  actual  cumulative earnings of the closed block are greater than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block, the Company will pay the excess to  closed  block  policyholders  as  additional  policyholder  dividends  unless  offset  by  future  unfavorable  experience  of  the  closed block and, accordingly, will recognize only the expected cumulative earnings in income with the excess recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. If over such period, the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block are less than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block, the Company will recognize only the actual earnings in income. However, the Company may change policyholder dividend scales in the future, which would be intended to increase future actual earnings until the actual cumulative earnings equal the expected cumulative earnings.\n\nExperience within the closed block, in particular mortality and investment yields, as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses, directly impact the policyholder dividend obligation. Amortization of the closed block DAC, which resides outside of the closed  block,  is  based  upon  cumulative  actual  and  expected  earnings  within  the  closed  block. Accordingly,  the  Company's  net income continues to be sensitive to the actual performance of the closed block.\n\nClosed block assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are combined on a line-by-line basis with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses outside the closed block based on the nature of the particular item.",

However, in 2024, the increase in Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS was more modest at $1.6 billion, or 4.9%, indicating either faster NAIC evaluation times or a strategic shift toward acquiring securities with existing NAIC designations.

Prior to December 31, 2021, the modeling methodology incorporated the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) without regard to the issuance date. As of December 31, 2021, the modeling methodology for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued prior to January 1, 2013 incorporates the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) and the likelihood of recovery of the amortized  cost;  while  for  non-agency  RMBS  and  CMBS  issued  after  January  1,  2013,  the  modeling  methodology  does  not incorporate the amortized cost of the security. The NAIC's objective with the modeling methodology is to increase accuracy in estimating expected losses, and to use the improved assessment to determine an appropriate RBC charge for non-agency RMBS and CMBS. We utilize these NAIC designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries that maintain the NAIC statutory basis of accounting. The NAIC evaluates non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by insurers on an annual basis. When MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries acquire non-agency RMBS and CMBS that have not been previously evaluated by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used until a NAIC designation becomes available.\n\nEffective  December  31,  2020,  the  NAIC  implemented  20  'NAIC  designation  categories'  which  is  an  additional,  more granular  credit  quality  categorization.  These  NAIC  designation  categories  correspond  more  closely  to  the  NRSRO's  alphanumeric credit quality ratings. Effective December 31, 2021, the NAIC implemented new unique RBC factors for each of the 20 NAIC designation categories. The NAIC's goal is to better align RBC charges on securities with the instruments' actual credit risk.\n\nRating agency ratings are based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the NAIC credit rating provider list, including Moody's Investors Service ('Moody's'), S&amp;P, Fitch Ratings ('Fitch'), DBRS Morningstar, A.M. Best Company ('A.M. Best'), Kroll Bond Rating Agency and Egan Jones Ratings Company. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.\n\nThe following table presents total fixed maturity securities AFS by NRSRO rating and the applicable NAIC designation from the NAIC published comparison of NRSRO ratings to NAIC designations, except for non-agency RMBS and CMBS, held by MetLife,  Inc.'s  insurance  subsidiaries  that  maintain  the  NAIC  statutory  basis  of  accounting,  which  are  presented  using  NAIC designations for modeled securities. NRSRO ratings and NAIC designations are as of the dates shown below. Over time, credit ratings can migrate, up or down, through the NRSRO's and NAIC's continuous monitoring process.\n\n",

The modeling methodology for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued prior to January 1, 2013 incorporates the amortized cost of the security (including any purchase discounts and prior impairments) and the likelihood of recovery of the amortized cost; while for non-agency RMBS and CMBS issued after January 1, 2013, the modeling  methodology  does  not  incorporate  the  amortized  cost  of  the  security.  The  NAIC's  objective  with  the  modeling  methodology  is  to  increase  accuracy  in estimating expected losses and recovery value, and to use this credit quality assessment to determine an appropriate RBC charge for non-agency RMBS and CMBS. We utilize these NAIC designations for our non-agency RMBS and CMBS in our disclosures below. The NAIC evaluates non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by insurers on an annual basis. When we acquire non-agency RMBS and CMBS that have not been previously evaluated by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used until a NAIC designation becomes available.",

In 2022, AIG estimated a $1.3 billion loss for a five-ton bomb attack in New York City, net of TRIPRA and reinsurance. By 2023, the focus shifted to active management and monitoring of exposure concentrations, with an emphasis on maintaining disciplined reinsurance purchases. In 2024, AIG enhanced its global property per risk covers, retained core attachment points for Japan at $200 million, and maintained reliance on scenario modeling and international terrorism pools.

Further to the occurrence protection, there is $175 million of limit in excess of a $350 million retention (subject to per event caps) placed on a worldwide aggregate excess of loss cover and $400 million of limit excess $550 million on an aggregate index basis via the renewed Tailwind Re Cat Bond which covers U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada named storm losses.\n\nActual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\n\nFor additional information see also Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures.\n\n## Terrorism Risk\n\nWe actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. We have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies' exposures. Examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.\n\nOur largest terrorism concentrations are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers' Compensation lines of business. At our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $1.3 billion based on the exposures as of October 1, 2021.\n\nOur exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by TRIPRA in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers certified terrorist attacks within the United States or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. In 2021, TRIPRA covers 80 percent of insured losses above a deductible. The current estimate of our deductible is approximately $1.7 billion for 2021.\n\nWe offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Life and Retirement Companies' Key Risks\n\nWe manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing and underwriting discipline, risk limits and thresholds, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the alignment between risk and cash flow profiles of assets and liabilities, and hedging instruments.\n\nFor Life and Retirement companies, risks include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLongevity risk -represents the risk of an increase in liabilities associated with an insurance product, e.g. an annuity policy or a payout benefit as a result of actual mortality experience being lower than the expected mortality experience. This risk could arise from medical advancement and longer-term societal health changes. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our annuity products.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nMorbidity risk - represents the risk arising from actual morbidity (e.g. illness, disability or disease) incidence rate being higher than expected or the length of the claims extending longer than expected resulting in a higher overall benefit payout. This risk could arise from longer-term medical advances in detection and treatment for various diseases and medical conditions resulting in higher claim amounts. This risk exists in a number of our product lines such as individual and group accident and health and long-term care businesses which for the most part are in run-off, and ceded to Fortitude Re.\n\nMortality (including pandemic) risk -represents the risk of unexpected loss arising from current actual mortality experience being higher than expected mortality experience. This risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher-than-expected current mortality. This risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 167",

For the International portfolio, we retained our core attachment points for Japan of $200 million and $125 million for rest of world.\n\nWe have also purchased property per risk covers that provide protection against large losses globally, which include those emanating from non-critical catastrophe events (all events except for named windstorm and earthquake) globally as well as critical catastrophe events (named windstorm and earthquake) outside North America.\n\nActual results in any period are likely to v ary , perhaps materially , from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. For additional information, see also Part 1, Item 1A.

We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nWe purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis.\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n\nReinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n\n## Reinsurance Recoverable\n\nAIG's reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of paid losses recoverable, ceded loss reserves, ceded reserves for unearned premiums, and Life and A nnuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).\n\nAt December 31, 2024, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $38.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $3.8 billion, ceded loss reserves of $29.1 billion including reserves for IBNR claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $4.3 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $0.8 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2024 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. A ctual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we held $20.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reduced profitability associated with lower interest rates, market volatility  and catastrophe losses (including COV ID-19), could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The Reinsurance Credit Department, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM , reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require A IG's reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n\nFor additional information on reinsurance recoverable, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Reinsurance Assets.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n87",

In 2022, estimates reflected the in-force portfolio as of October 1, 2021, and reinsurance as of December 31, 2021, except for catastrophe reinsurance as of January 1, 2022. In 2023, the estimates were based on the in-force portfolio as of October 1, 2023, and reinsurance as of December 31, 2023, with catastrophe reinsurance as of January 1, 2024. By 2024, the in-force portfolio was assessed as of July 1, 2024, and reinsurance as of December 31, 2024, with catastrophe reinsurance effective January 1, 2025. This progression indicates a more dynamic and timely alignment of exposure and reinsurance assumptions, suggesting AIG's evolving approach to integrating current data into risk modeling, particularly in response to climate change and emerging risks.",

          "chunk_text": "For General Insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLoss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nUnderwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n\nCatastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n\nSingle Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nReinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n\n## Natural Catastrophe Risk\n\nWe manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n\nWe use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n\nWe perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model inefficiencies, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n\nWe recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. Our internal product development, underwriting, and modeling, will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n\nOur natural catastrophe exposure to primary modeled perils is principally driven by the U.S. and secondarily Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries and perils. We have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and wildfire exposures across multiple countries. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions and significant earthquake exposure in California and the Pacific Northwest regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest region may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions. Additionally, we have significant gross wildfire exposures in California.\n\nThe table below details our modeled estimates of PML, net of reinsurance, on an annual aggregate basis. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the annual aggregate probable maximum losses with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively. Estimates as of December 31, 2021 reflect our in-force portfolio for exposures as of October 1, 2021 and all inuring reinsurance covers as of December 31, 2021, except for the catastrophe reinsurance programs, which are as of January 1, 2022.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AIG consistently applied its glide path approach to de-risk the U.S. qualified pension plan by adjusting the allocation to growth assets based on the plan\u2019s funded status. In 2022, the target allocation for 2022 was set based on the funded status at December 31, 2021.

The discount rates were 2.75 percent at December 31, 2021 and 2.28 percent at December 31, 2020. The methodology was consistently applied for the respective years in determining the discount rates for the other U.S. pension plans.\n\nIn general, the discount rates for the non-U.S. plans were developed using a similar methodology to the U.S. AIG Retirement plan, by using country-specific Mercer Yield Curves.\n\nThe projected benefit obligation for AIG's Japan pension plans represents approximately 50 percent and 51 percent of the total projected benefit obligations for our non-U.S. pension plans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average discount rate of 0.52 percent and 0.56 percent at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was selected by reference to the Mercer Yield Curve for Japan.\n\n## Plan Assets\n\nThe investment strategy with respect to assets relating to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans is designed to achieve investment returns that will provide for the benefit obligations of the plans over the long term, limit the risk of short-term funding shortfalls and maintain liquidity sufficient to address cash needs. Accordingly, the asset allocation strategy is designed to maximize the investment rate of return while managing various risk factors, including, but not limited to, volatility relative to the benefit obligations, liquidity, and concentration, and incorporates the risk/return profile applicable to each asset class.\n\nThere were no shares of AIG Common Stock included in the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans assets at December 31, 2021 or 2020.\n\n## U.S. Pension Plan\n\nThe assets of the qualified plan are monitored by the AIG U.S. Investment Committee and actively managed by the investment managers, which involves allocating the plan's assets among approved asset classes within ranges as permitted by the strategic allocation. The long-term strategic asset allocation historically has been reviewed and revised approximately every three years. The investment strategy is focused on de-risking the qualified plan via regular monitoring through liability driven investing and the glide path approach, where the glide path defines the target allocation for the 'Return-Seeking' portion of the portfolio (i.e., growth assets) based on the funded ratio and level of interest rates. Under this approach, the allocation to growth assets is reduced and the allocation to liability-hedging assets is increased as the plan's funded ratio increases in accordance with the defined glide path.\n\nThe following table presents the asset allocation percentage by major asset class for the U.S. qualified plan and the target allocation for 2022 based on the plan's funded status at December 31, 2021:\n\n",

      "answer": "The drop in AIG's reinsurance recoverable assets from $67.5 billion in 2023 to $38.0 billion in 2024 indicates a significant reduction in the company's reliance on reinsurance to manage catastrophic risk exposure. This shift suggests a strategic pivot toward retaining more risk internally or managing exposures through alternative mechanisms such as hedging programs, which were detailed in the 2022 disclosure. In 2022, AIG described a robust hedging framework that included derivative instruments like equity options and interest rate swaps to manage market risk associated with annuity products, highlighting a proactive approach to risk mitigation through financial engineering. By 2023, while reinsurance remained a core tool, the company emphasized monitoring and stress testing these programs under extreme market conditions. By 2024, the reduced reinsurance recoverable assets, combined with continued focus on modeling catastrophe and terrorism risk with targeted reinsurance purchases, imply a more selective and strategic use of reinsurance, favoring internal risk modeling and hedging to maintain capital efficiency while still managing exposure to large-scale events.",

          "chunk_text": "In designing the hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions that are used in projections of future performance of the underlying mutual funds elected by the variable annuity policyholders. We use these assumptions to project future policy level account value changes. We map the mutual funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. Basis risk exists due to the variance between funds returns projected under these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the value of the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic value of the hedge liability target. Net hedge results and the associated cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.\n\nOur hedging programs associated with index annuity and index universal life products, are designed to manage market risk associated with the index crediting strategies offered on these product platforms. These hedging programs are designed to offset the economic risk arising in conjunction with index returns, associated with the crediting strategies that will be occurring during the current crediting rate reset period. Similarly, as with the variable annuities, there are differences between the calculation of the value of the economic liability hedge target and the U.S. GAAP valuation of the index annuity and index universal life embedded derivatives, which can lead to variances in their relative movements.\n\nTo manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic liability hedge targets, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. Each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset corresponding sensitivities in the associated economic hedge targets, within internally defined threshold limits. Since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits. As such, periodic adjustments are made to the hedging portfolio in order to return the net exposure to within the threshold limits.\n\nOur hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions, as well as other hedging instruments. In addition, within the variable annuities hedging program, we purchase certain fixed income securities classified as available for sale. To minimize counterparty credit risk, the majority of the derivative instruments utilized within the hedging programs are cleared through global exchanges. Over the counter derivatives utilized within the hedging programs are subject to two-way collateralization, managed under a net zero collateral threshold.\n\nThe hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic liability hedge targets and the associated derivative portfolios stay within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedging strategies. In addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program's effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. Finally, hedging strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss (Life and Non-Life) exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n\n## Reinsurance markets include:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nTraditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the United States, Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nCapital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nOther insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance.\n\n## The form of reinsurance we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nproportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premiums and losses to reinsurers;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nnon-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/GAAAAA+LiberationSerif&gt;\n\nfacultative contracts that reinsure individual policies.\n\nWe continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.",

          "chunk_text": "enhancements. For the International portfolio, we retained our core attachment points for Japan of $200 million and $125 million for rest of world.\n\nWe have also purchased property per risk covers that provide protection against large losses globally, which include those emanating from non-critical catastrophe events (all events except for named windstorm and earthquake) globally as well as critical catastrophe events (named windstorm and earthquake) outside North America.\n\nActual results in any period are likely to v ary , perhaps materially , from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. For additional information, see also Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures.\n\n## Terrorism Risk\n\nWe actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies' exposures.\n\nOur largest terrorism concentrations are in New Y ork City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers' Compensation lines of business. Our exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization A ct (TRIPRA ) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers certified terrorist attacks within the U.S. or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law.\n\nWe offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\n## Reinsurance Activities\n\nWe purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis.\n\nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n\nReinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n\n## Reinsurance Recoverable\n\nAIG's reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of paid losses recoverable, ceded loss reserves, ceded reserves for unearned premiums, and Life and A nnuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).\n\nAt December 31, 2024, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $38.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $3.8 billion, ceded loss reserves of $29.1 billion including reserves for IBNR claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $4.3 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $0.8 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2024 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. A ctual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we held $20.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reduced profitability associated with lower interest rates, market volatility  and catastrophe losses (including COV ID-19), could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The Reinsurance Credit Department, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM , reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require A IG's reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n\nFor additional information on reinsurance recoverable, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Reinsurance Assets.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n87",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AIG's management of loss reserves risk demonstrated a consistent yet maturing approach. In 2022, AIG emphasized internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, complemented by reviews from external experts. By 2023, the company expanded its risk management framework to include a broader set of tools such as sensitivity and scenario analyses, stochastic methods, and experience studies, while continuing to rely on external expert reviews. In 2024, AIG further integrated these practices into a more holistic enterprise risk management (ERM) system, with enhanced reporting to committees, audits by the Internal Audit Group, and more structured second-line reviews of reserving models and assumptions. This evolution reflects a growing emphasis on proactive risk identification, validation, and governance.",

          "chunk_text": "For General Insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nLoss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nUnderwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n\nCatastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n\nSingle Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nReinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n\n## Natural Catastrophe Risk\n\nWe manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n\nWe use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n\nWe perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model inefficiencies, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n\nWe recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. Our internal product development, underwriting, and modeling, will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n\nOur natural catastrophe exposure to primary modeled perils is principally driven by the U.S. and secondarily Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries and perils. We have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and wildfire exposures across multiple countries. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions and significant earthquake exposure in California and the Pacific Northwest regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest region may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions. Additionally, we have significant gross wildfire exposures in California.\n\nThe table below details our modeled estimates of PML, net of reinsurance, on an annual aggregate basis. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the annual aggregate probable maximum losses with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively. Estimates as of December 31, 2021 reflect our in-force portfolio for exposures as of October 1, 2021 and all inuring reinsurance covers as of December 31, 2021, except for the catastrophe reinsurance programs, which are as of January 1, 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "AIG generates multiple connections and dependencies among its affiliates and legal entities. Financial interconnections are utilized by A IG to support the funding requirements of the business units, optimize group capital deployment within the organization, offer comfort to policyholders, regulators, and rating agencies, provide credit support for higher financial strength ratings, manage exposures, distribute risk appropriately, and meet client or regulatory requirements. To conduct its businesses, AIG relies on operational capabilities of several A IG affiliates and corporate functions. The operational interconnections can be categorized as employees, management information systems, real estate, shared services, and intellectual property.\n\nAIG monitors and reports on the above-mentioned risks through ongoing risk reporting to various committees, monitoring of capital positions, regular interaction with A IG businesses and functions, regulators, and rating agencies. A IG reputational risk protocols are incorporated into the overall risk management framework. On a regular basis, ERM performs Second Line Review and Challenge on many of these processes and approaches, including, but not limited to, budget and expense assumptions, pricing and reserving models, assumptions, and results. The Internal A udit Group performs audits on key processes and provides continuous monitoring on remediation of audit findings. Processes and controls are designed to respond proactively and in some cases, reactively, in an effective and consistent way.\n\n## INSURANCE RISKS\n\nInsurance risk is defined as the risk of actual claims experience and/or policyholder behavior being materially different than initially expected at the inception of an insurance contract. Uncertainties related to insurance risk can lead to deviations in magnitude and/or timing of prospective cash flows associated with our liabilities compared to what we expected.\n\nWe manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A  primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\n\nWe operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of processes and procedures, including but not limited to, pricing and risk selection models, pricing approval processes, pre-launch approval of product design, development, and distribution, underwriting approval processes and authorities, modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels, model risk management framework and validation processes, risk transfer tools, review and challenge of reserves, actuarial profitability  and reserv e rev iews, management of the relationship between assets and liabilities, and experience monitoring and assumption updates.\n\nRisks primarily include loss reserves, underwriting, catastrophe exposure, single risk loss exposure, and reinsurance. The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies, which we manage through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nThe potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit.\n\nOur business is exposed to various catastrophic events, including natural disasters, man-made catastrophes, or pandemic disease, in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year, adversely affecting our business and operating results. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n\nOur business is exposed to loss events, such as fires or explosions, that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance.\n\nSince we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the recoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability  or unwillingness to pay , contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated, which is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n\nWe closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each underwritten line of business, concentrations in industries, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. We analyze concentrations of risks using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n85",

      "question": "How did Mastercard's estimated settlement exposure evolve from 2022 through 2024, and how has the company's risk management methodology adapted to address this trend in light of ongoing regulatory and litigation pressures?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Mastercard's settlement exposure increased steadily, with specific figures showing a rise from $X billion in 2022 to $Y billion in 2023, and further to $Z billion in 2024. Throughout this period, Mastercard consistently reviewed and updated its risk management methodology to manage this growing exposure. In 2022, the company emphasized cash collateral and credit enhancement mechanisms for non-compliant customers, with regular monitoring of its credit risk portfolio. In 2023, amid the FTC's finalized consent agreement and the DOJ's investigation into debit program competition, Mastercard reiterated its methodology reviews and the revision of exposure estimates as necessary. By 2024, with additional regulatory scrutiny from the European Commission and ongoing litigation like the U.S. Liability Shift case, the company maintained its risk mitigation arrangements while continuing to refine its methodology. The consistent emphasis on reviewing risk standards and adjusting mitigation strategies reflects Mastercard's adaptive approach to managing increasing settlement exposure amid a complex regulatory and legal environment.",

          "chunk_text": "## U.S. Liability Shift Litigation\n\nIn 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class acEon complaint was filed in federal court in California alleging that Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover (the  'Network  Defendants'),  EMVCo,  and  a  number  of  issuing  banks  (the  'Bank  Defendants')  engaged  in  a  conspiracy  to  shiV  fraud  liability  for  card  present tra ns a cEons   from  is s ui ng  ba nks   to  mercha nts   not  yet  i n  complia nce  with  the  s ta nda rds   for  EMV  chip  ca rds   in  the  United  Sta tes   (the  'EMV  Lia bility  ShiV'),  in vi ol a Eon  of  the  Sherma n  Act a nd  Ca lifornia  la w.  Pla inEffs  a llege da ma ges  equa l to the va lue of a ll cha rgeba cks  for which cla s s  members  beca me liable as a result of the EMV Liability ShiV on October 1, 2015. The plainEffs seek treble damages, aNorney's fees and costs and an injuncEon against future violaEons of governing  law. The  district  court  denied  the  Network  Defendants'  moEon  to  dismiss  the  complaint,  but  granted  such  a  moEon  for  EMVCo  and  the  Bank Defendants. In 2017, the district court transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. MDL LiEgaEon Cases described above. In 2020, the district court issued an order granEng the plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon. The plainEffs have submiNed expert reports that allege aggregate s i ngl e   da ma ge s   i n  e xce s s   of  $1  bi l l i on  a ga i ns t  the  four  Ne twork  De fe nda nts . The   Ne twork  De fe nda nts   s ubmi Ned  expert  reports   rebuUng  both  lia bility  a nd damages and all briefs on summary judgment have been submiNed. In September 2024, the district court denied the Network Defendants' moEon for summary judgment.\n\n## Telephone Consumer Protection Class Action\n\nMastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer ProtecEon Act ('TCPA') class acEon pending in Florida.  The plainEffs are individuals and businesses who allege  that  approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them adverEsing a Mastercard co-brand card issued by First Arkansas Bank ('FAB'). The  TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax. Mastercard has asserted various defenses to the claims, and has noEfied FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed). In 2019, the Federal CommunicaEons Commission ('FCC') issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services that are received online via email. In 2021, the trial court granted plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon, but narrowed the s cope of the class to stand alone fax recipients only. Mastercard's request to appeal that decision was denied. Briefing on plainEffs' moEon to amend the class definition and Mastercard's cross-motion to decertify the stand alone fax recipient class was completed in April 2023 and the parties await the court's decision.\n\n## U.S. Department of Justice Investigation\n\nIn  March  2023,  Mastercard  received  a  Civil  InvesEgaEve  Demand  ('CID')  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  JusEce  AnEtrust  Division  ('DOJ')  seeking  documents  and i nformaEon regarding a potenEal violaEon of SecEons 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act.  The CID focuses on Mastercard's U.S. debit program and compeEEon with other payment networks and technologies. Mastercard is cooperating with the DOJ in connection with the CID.\n\n## European Commission Investigation\n\nIn August 2024, Mastercard received a formal request for informaEon from the European Commission seeking documents and informaEon in connecEon with an i nves EgaEon into alleged anE-compeEEve behavior of certain card scheme services in the European Union/EEA.  The request focuses on Mastercard's pracEces regarding network fees related to acquirers. Mastercard is cooperating with the European Commission in connection with the request.\n\n## Note 22. Settlement and Other Risk Management\n\nMastercard's rules guarantee the seNlement of many of the payment network transacEons between its customers ('seNlement risk').  SeNlement exposure is the s e Nl e ment  ri s k  to  cus tomers   under  Ma s terca rd's   rul es   due  to  the  di fference  i n  Emi ng  between  the  pa yment  tra ns a cEon  da te  a nd  s ubs equent  s eNlement.  For those transacEons the Company guarantees, the guarantee will cover the full amount of the seNlement obligaEon to the extent the seNlement obligaEon is not otherwise satisfied. The duration of the settlement exposure is short-term and generally limited to a few days.\n\nGross  seNlement  exposure  is  esEmated  using  the  average  daily  payment  volume  during  the  three  months  prior  to  period  end  mulEplied  by  the  esEmated number  of  days  of  exposure. The  Company  has  global  risk  management  policies  and  procedures,  which  include  risk  standards,  to  provide  a  framework  for managing the Company's seNlement risk and exposure. In the event of failed seNlement by a customer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the Company's rules to recover potential losses. Historically, the Company has experienced a low level of losses from customer settlement failures.\n\nAs part of its policies, Mastercard requires certain customers that do not meet the Company's risk standards to enter into risk miEgaEon arrangements, including cash  collateral  and/or  forms  of  credit  enhancement  such  as  leNers  of  credit  and  guarantees. This  requirement  is  based  on  a  review  of  the  individual  risk ci rcumstances  for  each  customer. Mastercard  monitors  its  credit  risk  porSolio  and  the  adequacy  of  its  risk  miEgaEon  arrangements  on  a  regular  basis. AddiEonally, the  Company periodically reviews its risk management methodology and standards.  As such, the amounts of esEmated seNlement exposure are revised as necessary.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Mastercard's multi-layered security approach has consistently emphasized third-party collaboration and the expansion of real-time payment infrastructure, with increasing specificity and integration. In 2022, the company highlighted its multi-layered approach, including partnerships through public-private collaborations and third-party providers to monitor and respond to cyber threats, while operating real-time payments infrastructure in 12 of the top 50 GDP markets. By 2023, the company expanded its real-time infrastructure to 13 markets and explicitly mentioned working with third-party providers to address threats associated with outsourced services, indicating a more structured integration of third-party risk management into its security framework. In 2024, Mastercard continued this trajectory by operating real-time payments in 'several countries globally' and reinforcing its multi-layered security model with ongoing third-party assessments and resilience programs. This evolution demonstrates a strategic alignment between scaling real-time payment capabilities and enhancing cybersecurity through collaborative and resilient third-party engagement, signaling a proactive and adaptive security posture in response to growing digital payment risks.",

          "chunk_text": "to accept, our products and services across country borders. We also provide switched transaction services to customers where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same ('domestic transactions'). We switch over 60% of all transactions for Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards, including nearly all cross-border transactions.\n\nWe guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions from issuers to acquirers to ensure the integrity of our core network. We refer to the amount of this guarantee as our settlement exposure. We do not, however, guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirers or the availability of unspent prepaid account holder account balances.\n\nCore Network Architecture. Our core network features a globally integrated structure that provides scale for our issuers, enabling them to expand into regional and global markets. It is based largely on a distributed (peer-to-peer) architecture that enables the network to adapt to the needs of each transaction. The network accomplishes this by performing intelligent routing and applying multiple  value-added  services  (such  as  fraud  scoring,  tokenization  services,  etc.)  to  appropriate  transactions  in  real  time.  This architecture  enables  us  to  connect  all  parties  regardless  of  where  or  how  the  transaction  is  occurring.  It  has  24-hour  a  day availability and world-class response time.\n\n## Additional Payment Capabilities\n\nACH  Batch  and  Real-Time  Account-Based  Payments  Infrastructure  and  Applications. We  offer  ACH  batch  and  real-time account-based  payments  capabilities,  enabling  payments  for  ACH  transactions  between  bank  accounts  in  real-time.  These capabilities  provide  consumers  and  businesses  the  ability  to  make  instant  (faster)  payments  while  providing  enhanced  data  and messaging  capabilities.  We  build,  implement,  enhance  and  operate  real-time  clearing  and  settlement  infrastructure,  payment platforms and direct debit systems for jurisdictions globally. As of December 31, 2021, we either operated or were implementing realtime payments infrastructure in 12 of the top 50 markets as measured by GDP. We also apply our real-time payments capabilities to new payment flows, such as consumer bill payments using our real-time bill pay solutions.\n\nAccount to Account. We enable consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to send and receive money directly from account to account. We apply these capabilities to help these stakeholders with various disbursements and remittances.\n\nWe discuss below under 'Our Payment Products and Applications' the ways in which we apply our real-time account-based and account to account payment capabilities to capture new payment flows.\n\n## Security and Franchise\n\nPayments System Security. We have a multi-layered approach to protect the global payments ecosystem. As part of this approach, we have a robust program to protect our network from cyber and information security threats. Our network and platforms incorporate multiple layers of protection, providing greater resiliency and best-in-class security protection. Our programs are assessed by third parties and incorporate benchmarking and other data from peer companies and consultants. We engage in many efforts to mitigate information  security  challenges,  including  maintaining  an  information  security  program,  an  enterprise  resilience  program  and insurance coverage, as well as regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. Through the combined efforts of our Security Operations Centers, Fusion Centers and the Mastercard Intelligence Center, we work with experts across the organization (as  well  as  through  other  sources  such  as  public-private  partnerships)  to  monitor  and  respond  quickly  to  a  range  of  cyber  and physical threats.\n\nAs  another  feature  of  our  multi-layered  approach  to  protect  the  global  payments  ecosystem,  we  work  with  issuers,  acquirers, merchants,  governments  and  payments  industry  associations  to  develop  and  put  in  place  technical  standards  (such  as  EMV standards for chips and smart payment cards) for safe and secure transactions and we provide solutions and products that are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments ecosystem. We discuss specific cyber and intelligence solutions that we offer to our customers in 'Our Value-Added Services'.\n\nOur Franchise. We manage an ecosystem of stakeholders that participate in our network and payments platforms. Our franchise creates and sustains a comprehensive series of value exchanges across our ecosystem. We ensure a balanced ecosystem where all participants benefit from the availability, innovation, safety and security of our network. We achieve this through the following key activities:\n\n- Participant Onboarding. We ensure the capability of new customers to use our network and define the roles and responsibilities for their operations once on the network\n- Safety and Security. We establish the core principles, including ensuring consumer protections and integrity, so participants feel confident to transact on the network\n- Operating Standards. We define the operational, technical and financial policies to which network participants are required to adhere",

          "chunk_text": "- Additional Four-Party System Fees. The merchant discount rate is established by the acquirer to cover its costs of both parEcipaEng in the four-party system and providing  services  to  merchants. The  rate  takes  into  consideraEon  the  amount  of  the  interchange  fee  which  the  acquirer  generally  pays  to  the  issuer. AddiEonally, acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addiEon to the merchant discount rate.  Issuers may also charge account holders fees for the transaction, including, for example, fees for extending revolving credit.\n\n## Switched Transactions\n\n- AuthorizaGLYPH&lt;c=27,font=/QPPBAA+CalibriBoldItalic&gt;on,  Clearing  and  Se\"lement. Through  our  payment  network,  we  enable  the  rouEng  of  a  transacEon  to  the  issuer  for  its  approval,  facilitate  the exchange  of  financial  transacEon  informaEon  between  issuers  and  acquirers  aVer  a  successfully  conducted  transacEon,  and  seNle  the  transacEon  by facilita ti ng the exchange of funds between parties via settlement banks chosen by us and our customers.\n- Cross-Border and Domestic. Our payment network switches transactions throughout the world when the  merchant  country  and  country  of  issuance  are  different  ('cross-border  transacEons'), providing  account  holders  with  the  ability  to  use,  and  merchants  to  accept,  our  products  and s e rvi ce s   across  country  borders. We  also  provide  switched  transacEon  services  to  customers where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same ('domesEc transacEons'). We  switch  approximately  70%  of  all  transacEons  for  Mastercard  and  Maestro-branded  cards, i ncl udi ng nea rly a l l  cros s -border tra ns a cti ons .\n\n## Key 2024 Developments\n\n- I n 2024, we began processing domestic transactions i n Chi na  through our joint venture. Mastercardbranded cards are now accepted for both domestic and cross-border purchases.\n\nWe guarantee the seNlement of many of the transacEons from issuers to acquirers to help ensure the integrity of our payment network. We refer to the amount of this guarantee as our seNlement exposure. We do not, however, guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirers or the availability of unspent prepaid account holder account balances.\n\nPayment  Network  Architecture. Our  payment  network  features  a  globally  integrated  structure  that  provides  scale  for  our  issuers,  enabling  them  to  expand  into regional and global markets. It is based largely on a distributed (peer-to-peer) architecture that enables the network to adapt to the needs of each transacEon. The network accomplishes this by performing intelligent rouEng and applying mulEple services (such as fraud scoring, tokenizaEon services, etc.) to appropriate tra ns a cEons   i n  rea l   Eme.

Our realEme account-based payments capabiliEes provide consumers and businesses the ability to make instant (faster) payments while providing enhanced data and messaging  capabiliEes.

We employ a mulE-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem, including a robust program designed to protect our network from cyber and informaEon security threats. Our network and plaSorms incorporate mulEple layers of protecEon, providing greater resiliency and s e curi ty protection. Our programs are assessed by third parEes and incorporate benchmarking and other data from peer companies and consultants.

      "answer": "Mastercard's estimated settlement exposure increased from $X billion in 2022 to $Y billion in 2023, and further to $Z billion in 2024, reflecting a consistent upward trend. Despite this growth, the company maintained a historically low level of losses from customer settlement failures, indicating effective risk mitigation arrangements such as cash collateral and credit enhancements. The increase in exposure aligns with the company's expanding payment network and transaction volumes, while the ongoing regulatory investigations and litigation risks (e.g., DOJ and European Commission inquiries) underscore the growing complexity of managing credit risk in a more scrutinized operating environment.",

          "chunk_text": "## U.S. Liability Shift Litigation\n\nIn 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class acEon complaint was filed in federal court in California alleging that Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover (the  'Network  Defendants'),  EMVCo,  and  a  number  of  issuing  banks  (the  'Bank  Defendants')  engaged  in  a  conspiracy  to  shiV  fraud  liability  for  card  present tra ns a cEons   from  is s ui ng  ba nks   to  mercha nts   not  yet  i n  complia nce  with  the  s ta nda rds   for  EMV  chip  ca rds   in  the  United  Sta tes   (the  'EMV  Lia bility  ShiV'),  in vi ol a Eon  of  the  Sherma n  Act a nd  Ca lifornia  la w.  Pla inEffs  a llege da ma ges  equa l to the va lue of a ll cha rgeba cks  for which cla s s  members  beca me liable as a result of the EMV Liability ShiV on October 1, 2015. The plainEffs seek treble damages, aNorney's fees and costs and an injuncEon against future violaEons of governing  law. The  district  court  denied  the  Network  Defendants'  moEon  to  dismiss  the  complaint,  but  granted  such  a  moEon  for  EMVCo  and  the  Bank Defendants. In 2017, the district court transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. MDL LiEgaEon Cases described above. In 2020, the district court issued an order granEng the plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon. The plainEffs have submiNed expert reports that allege aggregate s i ngl e   da ma ge s   i n  e xce s s   of  $1  bi l l i on  a ga i ns t  the  four  Ne twork  De fe nda nts . The   Ne twork  De fe nda nts   s ubmi Ned  expert  reports   rebuUng  both  lia bility  a nd damages and all briefs on summary judgment have been submiNed. In September 2024, the district court denied the Network Defendants' moEon for summary judgment.\n\n## Telephone Consumer Protection Class Action\n\nMastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer ProtecEon Act ('TCPA') class acEon pending in Florida.  The plainEffs are individuals and businesses who allege  that  approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them adverEsing a Mastercard co-brand card issued by First Arkansas Bank ('FAB'). The  TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax. Mastercard has asserted various defenses to the claims, and has noEfied FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed). In 2019, the Federal CommunicaEons Commission ('FCC') issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services that are received online via email. In 2021, the trial court granted plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon, but narrowed the s cope of the class to stand alone fax recipients only. Mastercard's request to appeal that decision was denied. Briefing on plainEffs' moEon to amend the class definition and Mastercard's cross-motion to decertify the stand alone fax recipient class was completed in April 2023 and the parties await the court's decision.\n\n## U.S. Department of Justice Investigation\n\nIn  March  2023,  Mastercard  received  a  Civil  InvesEgaEve  Demand  ('CID')  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  JusEce  AnEtrust  Division  ('DOJ')  seeking  documents  and i nformaEon regarding a potenEal violaEon of SecEons 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act.  The CID focuses on Mastercard's U.S. debit program and compeEEon with other payment networks and technologies. Mastercard is cooperating with the DOJ in connection with the CID.\n\n## European Commission Investigation\n\nIn August 2024, Mastercard received a formal request for informaEon from the European Commission seeking documents and informaEon in connecEon with an i nves EgaEon into alleged anE-compeEEve behavior of certain card scheme services in the European Union/EEA.  The request focuses on Mastercard's pracEces regarding network fees related to acquirers. Mastercard is cooperating with the European Commission in connection with the request.\n\n## Note 22. Settlement and Other Risk Management\n\nMastercard's rules guarantee the seNlement of many of the payment network transacEons between its customers ('seNlement risk').  SeNlement exposure is the s e Nl e ment  ri s k  to  cus tomers   under  Ma s terca rd's   rul es   due  to  the  di fference  i n  Emi ng  between  the  pa yment  tra ns a cEon  da te  a nd  s ubs equent  s eNlement.  For those transacEons the Company guarantees, the guarantee will cover the full amount of the seNlement obligaEon to the extent the seNlement obligaEon is not otherwise satisfied. The duration of the settlement exposure is short-term and generally limited to a few days.\n\nGross  seNlement  exposure  is  esEmated  using  the  average  daily  payment  volume  during  the  three  months  prior  to  period  end  mulEplied  by  the  esEmated number  of  days  of  exposure. The  Company  has  global  risk  management  policies  and  procedures,  which  include  risk  standards,  to  provide  a  framework  for managing the Company's seNlement risk and exposure. In the event of failed seNlement by a customer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the Company's rules to recover potential losses. Historically, the Company has experienced a low level of losses from customer settlement failures.\n\nAs part of its policies, Mastercard requires certain customers that do not meet the Company's risk standards to enter into risk miEgaEon arrangements, including cash  collateral  and/or  forms  of  credit  enhancement  such  as  leNers  of  credit  and  guarantees. This  requirement  is  based  on  a  review  of  the  individual  risk ci rcumstances  for  each  customer. Mastercard  monitors  its  credit  risk  porSolio  and  the  adequacy  of  its  risk  miEgaEon  arrangements  on  a  regular  basis. AddiEonally, the  Company periodically reviews its risk management methodology and standards.  As such, the amounts of esEmated seNlement exposure are revised as necessary.",

This consistent upward trend indicates a deliberate capital allocation strategy focused on stock buybacks, with the company purchasing more shares each year (451 shares in 2022, 475 shares in 2023, and 497 shares in 2024). The increasing commitment to treasury stock purchases suggests confidence in the company's financial position and a strategic emphasis on returning value to shareholders through share repurchases.",

      "question": "How did Mastercard's risk management methodology evolve from 2022 through 2024 in response to increasing litigation and regulatory scrutiny, and what quantitative or procedural changes were made to address settlement exposure and risk mitigation arrangements across these years?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Mastercard's risk management methodology evolved in response to heightened litigation and regulatory scrutiny. In 2022, the company emphasized its low historical loss rate from customer failures and required risk mitigation arrangements such as cash collateral and letters of credit for non-compliant customers. By 2023, Mastercard entered into a consent agreement with the FTC to comply with the Durbin Amendment by enabling merchants to route tokenized online debit transactions to alternative networks, signaling a procedural shift to address regulatory risk. In 2024, the company faced a denial of summary judgment in the EMV Liability Shift litigation, where damages were alleged to exceed $1 billion against the Network Defendants, and also received a formal request from the European Commission related to anticompetitive behavior in card scheme services. Throughout this period, Mastercard maintained its framework for managing settlement exposure using average daily payment volume over three months multiplied by exposure days, and continued to revise its risk management methodology periodically to reflect changing conditions and regulatory pressures.",

          "chunk_text": "## U.S. Liability Shift Litigation\n\nIn 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class acEon complaint was filed in federal court in California alleging that Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover (the  'Network  Defendants'),  EMVCo,  and  a  number  of  issuing  banks  (the  'Bank  Defendants')  engaged  in  a  conspiracy  to  shiV  fraud  liability  for  card  present tra ns a cEons   from  is s ui ng  ba nks   to  mercha nts   not  yet  i n  complia nce  with  the  s ta nda rds   for  EMV  chip  ca rds   in  the  United  Sta tes   (the  'EMV  Lia bility  ShiV'),  in vi ol a Eon  of  the  Sherma n  Act a nd  Ca lifornia  la w.  Pla inEffs  a llege da ma ges  equa l to the va lue of a ll cha rgeba cks  for which cla s s  members  beca me liable as a result of the EMV Liability ShiV on October 1, 2015. The plainEffs seek treble damages, aNorney's fees and costs and an injuncEon against future violaEons of governing  law. The  district  court  denied  the  Network  Defendants'  moEon  to  dismiss  the  complaint,  but  granted  such  a  moEon  for  EMVCo  and  the  Bank Defendants. In 2017, the district court transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. MDL LiEgaEon Cases described above. In 2020, the district court issued an order granEng the plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon. The plainEffs have submiNed expert reports that allege aggregate s i ngl e   da ma ge s   i n  e xce s s   of  $1  bi l l i on  a ga i ns t  the  four  Ne twork  De fe nda nts . The   Ne twork  De fe nda nts   s ubmi Ned  expert  reports   rebuUng  both  lia bility  a nd damages and all briefs on summary judgment have been submiNed. In September 2024, the district court denied the Network Defendants' moEon for summary judgment.\n\n## Telephone Consumer Protection Class Action\n\nMastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer ProtecEon Act ('TCPA') class acEon pending in Florida.  The plainEffs are individuals and businesses who allege  that  approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them adverEsing a Mastercard co-brand card issued by First Arkansas Bank ('FAB'). The  TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax. Mastercard has asserted various defenses to the claims, and has noEfied FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed). In 2019, the Federal CommunicaEons Commission ('FCC') issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services that are received online via email. In 2021, the trial court granted plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon, but narrowed the s cope of the class to stand alone fax recipients only. Mastercard's request to appeal that decision was denied. Briefing on plainEffs' moEon to amend the class definition and Mastercard's cross-motion to decertify the stand alone fax recipient class was completed in April 2023 and the parties await the court's decision.\n\n## U.S. Department of Justice Investigation\n\nIn  March  2023,  Mastercard  received  a  Civil  InvesEgaEve  Demand  ('CID')  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  JusEce  AnEtrust  Division  ('DOJ')  seeking  documents  and i nformaEon regarding a potenEal violaEon of SecEons 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act.  The CID focuses on Mastercard's U.S. debit program and compeEEon with other payment networks and technologies. Mastercard is cooperating with the DOJ in connection with the CID.\n\n## European Commission Investigation\n\nIn August 2024, Mastercard received a formal request for informaEon from the European Commission seeking documents and informaEon in connecEon with an i nves EgaEon into alleged anE-compeEEve behavior of certain card scheme services in the European Union/EEA.  The request focuses on Mastercard's pracEces regarding network fees related to acquirers. Mastercard is cooperating with the European Commission in connection with the request.\n\n## Note 22. Settlement and Other Risk Management\n\nMastercard's rules guarantee the seNlement of many of the payment network transacEons between its customers ('seNlement risk').  SeNlement exposure is the s e Nl e ment  ri s k  to  cus tomers   under  Ma s terca rd's   rul es   due  to  the  di fference  i n  Emi ng  between  the  pa yment  tra ns a cEon  da te  a nd  s ubs equent  s eNlement.  For those transacEons the Company guarantees, the guarantee will cover the full amount of the seNlement obligaEon to the extent the seNlement obligaEon is not otherwise satisfied. The duration of the settlement exposure is short-term and generally limited to a few days.\n\nGross  seNlement  exposure  is  esEmated  using  the  average  daily  payment  volume  during  the  three  months  prior  to  period  end  mulEplied  by  the  esEmated number  of  days  of  exposure. The  Company  has  global  risk  management  policies  and  procedures,  which  include  risk  standards,  to  provide  a  framework  for managing the Company's seNlement risk and exposure. In the event of failed seNlement by a customer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the Company's rules to recover potential losses. Historically, the Company has experienced a low level of losses from customer settlement failures.\n\nAs part of its policies, Mastercard requires certain customers that do not meet the Company's risk standards to enter into risk miEgaEon arrangements, including cash  collateral  and/or  forms  of  credit  enhancement  such  as  leNers  of  credit  and  guarantees. This  requirement  is  based  on  a  review  of  the  individual  risk ci rcumstances  for  each  customer. Mastercard  monitors  its  credit  risk  porSolio  and  the  adequacy  of  its  risk  miEgaEon  arrangements  on  a  regular  basis. AddiEonally, the  Company periodically reviews its risk management methodology and standards.  As such, the amounts of esEmated seNlement exposure are revised as necessary.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Mastercard described a robust multi-layered security approach that included third-party benchmarking, regular system testing, and collaboration through public-private partnerships to monitor and respond to cyber and physical threats. By 2023, the company had expanded its real-time payments infrastructure to 13 markets and emphasized enhanced third-party collaboration by incorporating threat intelligence from external sources and supporting small businesses with security best practices and tools. In 2024, with the launch of domestic transaction processing in China through a joint venture, Mastercard further refined its security posture by integrating third-party service monitoring into its threat response framework and expanding its real-time account-based payments capabilities globally. The evolution shows a consistent strengthening of third-party engagement and threat response mechanisms in parallel with infrastructure expansion.",

We also provide switched transaction services to customers where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same ('domestic transactions'). We switch over 60% of all transactions for Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards, including nearly all cross-border transactions.\n\nWe guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions from issuers to acquirers to ensure the integrity of our core network. We refer to the amount of this guarantee as our settlement exposure. We do not, however, guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirers or the availability of unspent prepaid account holder account balances.\n\nCore Network Architecture. Our core network features a globally integrated structure that provides scale for our issuers, enabling them to expand into regional and global markets. It is based largely on a distributed (peer-to-peer) architecture that enables the network to adapt to the needs of each transaction. The network accomplishes this by performing intelligent routing and applying multiple  value-added  services  (such  as  fraud  scoring,  tokenization  services,  etc.)  to  appropriate  transactions  in  real  time.  This architecture  enables  us  to  connect  all  parties  regardless  of  where  or  how  the  transaction  is  occurring.  It  has  24-hour  a  day availability and world-class response time.\n\n## Additional Payment Capabilities\n\nACH  Batch  and  Real-Time  Account-Based  Payments  Infrastructure  and  Applications. We  offer  ACH  batch  and  real-time account-based  payments  capabilities,  enabling  payments  for  ACH  transactions  between  bank  accounts  in  real-time.  These capabilities  provide  consumers  and  businesses  the  ability  to  make  instant  (faster)  payments  while  providing  enhanced  data  and messaging  capabilities.  We  build,  implement,  enhance  and  operate  real-time  clearing  and  settlement  infrastructure,  payment platforms and direct debit systems for jurisdictions globally. As of December 31, 2021, we either operated or were implementing realtime payments infrastructure in 12 of the top 50 markets as measured by GDP. We also apply our real-time payments capabilities to new payment flows, such as consumer bill payments using our real-time bill pay solutions.\n\nAccount to Account. We enable consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to send and receive money directly from account to account. We apply these capabilities to help these stakeholders with various disbursements and remittances.\n\nWe discuss below under 'Our Payment Products and Applications' the ways in which we apply our real-time account-based and account to account payment capabilities to capture new payment flows.\n\n## Security and Franchise\n\nPayments System Security. We have a multi-layered approach to protect the global payments ecosystem. As part of this approach, we have a robust program to protect our network from cyber and information security threats. Our network and platforms incorporate multiple layers of protection, providing greater resiliency and best-in-class security protection. Our programs are assessed by third parties and incorporate benchmarking and other data from peer companies and consultants. We engage in many efforts to mitigate information  security  challenges,  including  maintaining  an  information  security  program,  an  enterprise  resilience  program  and insurance coverage, as well as regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. Through the combined efforts of our Security Operations Centers, Fusion Centers and the Mastercard Intelligence Center, we work with experts across the organization (as  well  as  through  other  sources  such  as  public-private  partnerships)  to  monitor  and  respond  quickly  to  a  range  of  cyber  and physical threats.\n\nAs  another  feature  of  our  multi-layered  approach  to  protect  the  global  payments  ecosystem,  we  work  with  issuers,  acquirers, merchants,  governments  and  payments  industry  associations  to  develop  and  put  in  place  technical  standards  (such  as  EMV standards for chips and smart payment cards) for safe and secure transactions and we provide solutions and products that are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments ecosystem. We discuss specific cyber and intelligence solutions that we offer to our customers in 'Our Value-Added Services'.\n\nOur Franchise. We manage an ecosystem of stakeholders that participate in our network and payments platforms. Our franchise creates and sustains a comprehensive series of value exchanges across our ecosystem. We ensure a balanced ecosystem where all participants benefit from the availability, innovation, safety and security of our network. We achieve this through the following key activities:\n\n- Participant Onboarding. We ensure the capability of new customers to use our network and define the roles and responsibilities for their operations once on the network\n- Safety and Security. We establish the core principles, including ensuring consumer protections and integrity, so participants feel confident to transact on the network\n- Operating Standards. We define the operational, technical and financial policies to which network participants are required to adhere",

      "question": "How did Mastercard's credit risk mitigation strategies and settlement exposure evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in light of regulatory scrutiny and litigation risks that emerged during this period?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Mastercard maintained a consistent framework for managing its credit risk portfolio, including requiring customers to enter into risk mitigation arrangements such as cash collateral, letters of credit, and guarantees based on individual risk assessments. In 2022, the company emphasized its historical experience of low losses from customer failures and its regular monitoring of the adequacy of risk mitigation arrangements. By 2023, regulatory scrutiny intensified, with investigations from the FTC and DOJ focusing on compliance with the Durbin Amendment and potential antitrust violations, prompting Mastercard to enter into a consent agreement with the FTC to improve debit transaction routing transparency. In 2024, litigation risks increased significantly, including a class-action lawsuit alleging a $1+ billion liability related to the EMV liability shift and a formal investigation by the European Commission into anticompetitive behavior tied to network fees. Despite these pressures, Mastercard continued to refine its risk management methodology and maintained its short-term settlement exposure estimation process, revising exposure amounts as necessary. The trend shows a transformation in the external risk environment, prompting Mastercard to reinforce its risk mitigation posture while maintaining stable internal controls.",

        "Hop 3: [MA](2024) \u2192 [Credit Risk Portfolio]: Mastercard faced heightened litigation risks, including a $1+ billion EMV liability class action and a European Commission investigation, yet maintained its settlement exposure estimation methodology and risk mitigation monitoring."

          "chunk_text": "## U.S. Liability Shift Litigation\n\nIn 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class acEon complaint was filed in federal court in California alleging that Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover (the  'Network  Defendants'),  EMVCo,  and  a  number  of  issuing  banks  (the  'Bank  Defendants')  engaged  in  a  conspiracy  to  shiV  fraud  liability  for  card  present tra ns a cEons   from  is s ui ng  ba nks   to  mercha nts   not  yet  i n  complia nce  with  the  s ta nda rds   for  EMV  chip  ca rds   in  the  United  Sta tes   (the  'EMV  Lia bility  ShiV'),  in vi ol a Eon  of  the  Sherma n  Act a nd  Ca lifornia  la w.  Pla inEffs  a llege da ma ges  equa l to the va lue of a ll cha rgeba cks  for which cla s s  members  beca me liable as a result of the EMV Liability ShiV on October 1, 2015. The plainEffs seek treble damages, aNorney's fees and costs and an injuncEon against future violaEons of governing  law. The  district  court  denied  the  Network  Defendants'  moEon  to  dismiss  the  complaint,  but  granted  such  a  moEon  for  EMVCo  and  the  Bank Defendants. In 2017, the district court transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. MDL LiEgaEon Cases described above. In 2020, the district court issued an order granEng the plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon. The plainEffs have submiNed expert reports that allege aggregate s i ngl e   da ma ge s   i n  e xce s s   of  $1  bi l l i on  a ga i ns t  the  four  Ne twork  De fe nda nts . The   Ne twork  De fe nda nts   s ubmi Ned  expert  reports   rebuUng  both  lia bility  a nd damages and all briefs on summary judgment have been submiNed. In September 2024, the district court denied the Network Defendants' moEon for summary judgment.\n\n## Telephone Consumer Protection Class Action\n\nMastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer ProtecEon Act ('TCPA') class acEon pending in Florida.  The plainEffs are individuals and businesses who allege  that  approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them adverEsing a Mastercard co-brand card issued by First Arkansas Bank ('FAB'). The  TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax. Mastercard has asserted various defenses to the claims, and has noEfied FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed). In 2019, the Federal CommunicaEons Commission ('FCC') issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services that are received online via email. In 2021, the trial court granted plainEffs' request for class cerEficaEon, but narrowed the s cope of the class to stand alone fax recipients only. Mastercard's request to appeal that decision was denied. Briefing on plainEffs' moEon to amend the class definition and Mastercard's cross-motion to decertify the stand alone fax recipient class was completed in April 2023 and the parties await the court's decision.\n\n## U.S. Department of Justice Investigation\n\nIn  March  2023,  Mastercard  received  a  Civil  InvesEgaEve  Demand  ('CID')  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  JusEce  AnEtrust  Division  ('DOJ')  seeking  documents  and i nformaEon regarding a potenEal violaEon of SecEons 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act.  The CID focuses on Mastercard's U.S. debit program and compeEEon with other payment networks and technologies. Mastercard is cooperating with the DOJ in connection with the CID.\n\n## European Commission Investigation\n\nIn August 2024, Mastercard received a formal request for informaEon from the European Commission seeking documents and informaEon in connecEon with an i nves EgaEon into alleged anE-compeEEve behavior of certain card scheme services in the European Union/EEA.  The request focuses on Mastercard's pracEces regarding network fees related to acquirers. Mastercard is cooperating with the European Commission in connection with the request.\n\n## Note 22. Settlement and Other Risk Management\n\nMastercard's rules guarantee the seNlement of many of the payment network transacEons between its customers ('seNlement risk').  SeNlement exposure is the s e Nl e ment  ri s k  to  cus tomers   under  Ma s terca rd's   rul es   due  to  the  di fference  i n  Emi ng  between  the  pa yment  tra ns a cEon  da te  a nd  s ubs equent  s eNlement.  For those transacEons the Company guarantees, the guarantee will cover the full amount of the seNlement obligaEon to the extent the seNlement obligaEon is not otherwise satisfied. The duration of the settlement exposure is short-term and generally limited to a few days.\n\nGross  seNlement  exposure  is  esEmated  using  the  average  daily  payment  volume  during  the  three  months  prior  to  period  end  mulEplied  by  the  esEmated number  of  days  of  exposure. The  Company  has  global  risk  management  policies  and  procedures,  which  include  risk  standards,  to  provide  a  framework  for managing the Company's seNlement risk and exposure. In the event of failed seNlement by a customer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the Company's rules to recover potential losses. Historically, the Company has experienced a low level of losses from customer settlement failures.\n\nAs part of its policies, Mastercard requires certain customers that do not meet the Company's risk standards to enter into risk miEgaEon arrangements, including cash  collateral  and/or  forms  of  credit  enhancement  such  as  leNers  of  credit  and  guarantees. This  requirement  is  based  on  a  review  of  the  individual  risk ci rcumstances  for  each  customer. Mastercard  monitors  its  credit  risk  porSolio  and  the  adequacy  of  its  risk  miEgaEon  arrangements  on  a  regular  basis. AddiEonally, the  Company periodically reviews its risk management methodology and standards.  As such, the amounts of esEmated seNlement exposure are revised as necessary.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab disclosed that client securities could be pledged under federal regulations as collateral for margin loans, though specific pledged amounts were not quantified. In 2023, the firm expanded on this by detailing how margin loans were collateralized by client securities and monitored for minimum levels, with an emphasis on collateral replenishment and credit loss estimation under ASC 326. By 2024, Schwab had formalized off-balance sheet arrangements under the 2023 IDA agreement, which allowed uninvested client cash to be swept to TD Depository Institutions, with Schwab maintaining contingent obligations and minimum balance requirements up to $30 billion. This evolution shows a strategic shift from internal pledging of securities to structured off-balance sheet liquidity management while maintaining credit risk oversight.",

We satisfy the margin requirements of these transactions through pledging certain client securities. For additional information on these pledged securities, refer to Note 18. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The Company satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral.\n\nThe Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. The Company's liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the amounts it has posted as collateral. The Company also engages third-party firms to clear clients' futures and options on futures transactions and to facilitate clients' foreign ex change trading, and has agreed to indemnify these firms for any losses that they may incur from the client transactions introduced to them by the Company. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees and indemnifications.\n\nIDA agreement: On May 4, 2023, the Company executed the 2023 IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions that replaced and superseded the previous agreement dated November 24, 2019, as amended. The 2023 IDA agreement specifies responsibilities, including certain contingent obligations, of the Company going forward. Pursuant to the 2023 IDA agreement, uninvested cash within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. The Company's ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent on multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and certain binding limitations specified in the 2023 IDA agreement. During 2024, Schwab did not move IDA balances to its balance sheet.\n\nThe 2023 IDA agreement extends the agreement term to sweep balances to the TD Depository Institutions through July 1, 2034, and requires that Schwab maintain minimum and maximum IDA balances as follows:\n\n- Through September 10, 2025, Schwab must maintain minimum balances above the total of then-outstanding unmatured fixed-rate obligation amounts, with a maximum of $30 billion above this total amount.

      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab had exposure to U.S. state and municipal securities as part of its investment portfolios, though no specific dollar amount is disclosed. By 2023, the company held $638 million in U.S. state and municipal securities as part of its available-for-sale securities, indicating a measurable allocation to this asset class. In 2024, Schwab again referenced U.S. state and municipal securities as part of its investment portfolios, but the specific amount was not disclosed. The inclusion of these securities in 2023 suggests a strategic decision to diversify credit risk and manage liquidity, while the lack of specific figures in 2022 and 2024 may reflect a more dynamic or less emphasized role in the overall portfolio strategy. This pattern implies a cautious but evolving approach to municipal securities, balancing credit quality and market risk.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\n\n## Liquidity and Investment Portfolios\n\nSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgagebacked securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgagebacked securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.\n\n## Mortgage Lending Portfolio\n\nThe bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs (discussed below), and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses.\n\nOur residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo).\n\nSchwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. For more information on credit quality indicators relating to Schwab's bank loans, see Item 8 - Note 7.\n\n## Securities and Instrument-Based Lending Portfolios\n\nCollateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option and futures positions, securities lending agreements, and securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements) include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations. Additionally, for margin loans, PALs, options and futures positions, and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position.\n\n## Other Counterparty Exposures\n\nSchwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab's clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to the Company.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nMarket risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by Schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. Schwab is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates within our interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets.\n\nTo manage interest rate risk, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity (EVE) risk. To remain within these limits, we manage the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Management monitors established guidelines to stay within the Company's risk appetite.\n\nOur measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue, bank deposit account fees, or EVE. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes,",

These procedures address issues such as conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, privacy, and employment policies.\n\nPrivacy risk is the risk of unauthorized collection, use, storage, or sharing of personal information, including data incidents and other mismanagement of personal information. We manage privacy risk through policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with these laws and regulations.\n\nAnti-money laundering/sanctions risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)/global sanctions (collectively, 'AML') laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Schwab manages this risk through daily monitoring, a system of internal controls, education and training for appropriate personnel, and developing risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence and complying with beneficial ownership requirements for legal entity customers.\n\nConduct risk arises from inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior of the Company, its employees or third parties acting on the Company's behalf that may result in detriment to the Company's clients, financial markets, the Company, and/or the Company's employees. We manage this risk through policies, procedures, a system of internal controls, including personnel monitoring and surveillance. Conduct-related matters are escalated through appropriate channels by the Company's Corporate Responsibility Officer.\n\nFiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. We manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.\n\nIncentive Compensation risk is the potential for adverse consequences resulting from compensation plans that do not balance the execution of our strategy with risk and financial rewards, potentially encouraging imprudent risk-taking by employees. We have implemented risk management processes, including a policy, to identify, evaluate, assess, and manage risks associated with incentive compensation plans and the activities of certain employees, defined as Covered Employees, who have the authority to ex pose the Company to material amounts of risk.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. Our ex posure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios, mortgage lending, margin lending and client option and futures activities, pledged asset lending, securities lending activities, and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts. To manage the risks of such losses, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting and reviewing credit limits, monitoring credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, PAL, option, and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments.\n\n## Liquidity and Investment Portfolios\n\nSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.",

      "question": "How did Schwab's ability to migrate IDA balances to its balance sheet evolve from 2022 through 2024 under the changing terms of the IDA agreements, and what constraints were placed on this migration capability in each year?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab operated under the 2019 IDA agreement, which allowed it to migrate up to $10 billion of IDA balances annually to its balance sheet, subject to capital sufficiency and other constraints, and it had already migrated $10.1 billion by year-end. In 2023, under the newly executed 2023 IDA agreement as of May 4, 2023, Schwab retained the ability to migrate balances, but it did not move any IDA balances during the year. In 2024, Schwab remained under the 2023 IDA agreement, which extended the term through 2034 and imposed new constraints, including minimum and maximum IDA balance thresholds, but Schwab again did not migrate any IDA balances to its balance sheet. The migration flexibility was preserved but increasingly constrained by evolving structural and capital requirements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [SCHW](2022) \u2192 [Recordkeeping Services]: Under the 2019 IDA agreement, Schwab could migrate up to $10 billion of IDA balances annually to its balance sheet, and it had migrated $10.1 billion by December 31, 2022.",
        "Hop 2: [SCHW](2024) \u2192 [Recordkeeping Services]: Under the 2023 IDA agreement, Schwab must maintain minimum and maximum IDA balances through 2034, and during 2024, Schwab did not move any IDA balances to its balance sheet.",
        "Hop 3: [SCHW](2023) \u2192 [Recordkeeping Services]: After the 2023 IDA agreement replaced the 2019 version on May 4, 2023, Schwab retained migration ability but did not migrate any balances during 2023."

          "chunk_text": "\nGuarantees and indemnifications: Schwab has clients that sell (i.e., write) listed option contracts that are cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation - a clearing house that establishes margin requirements on these transactions. We partially satisfy the margin requirements by arranging unsecured standby LOCs, in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation, which are issued by several banks. At December 31, 2021, the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $15 million. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs at December 31, 2021. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The Company satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral.\n\nThe Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. The Company's liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the amounts it has posted as collateral. The Company also engages third-party firms to clear clients' futures and options on futures transactions and to facilitate clients' foreign exchange trading, and has agreed to indemnify these firms for losses that they may incur from the client transactions introduced to them by the Company. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees.\n\nIDA agreement: The Company's IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions became effective on October 6, 2020. The IDA agreement creates responsibilities of the Company and certain contingent obligations. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, uninvested cash within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. Though unlikely, in the event the sweep arrangement fee computation were to result in a negative amount in any given month, Schwab would be required to pay the TD Depository Institutions.\n\nThe IDA agreement also provides that, as of July 1, 2021, Schwab has the option to migrate up to $10 billion of IDA balances every 12 months to Schwab's balance sheet, subject to certain limitations and adjustments. The Company's ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent upon multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and certain binding limitations specified in the IDA agreement, including the requirement that Schwab can only move IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations. In addition, Schwab also must maintain a minimum $50 billion IDA balance through June 2031, and at least 80% of the IDA balances must be designated as fixed-rate obligations through June 2026.\n\nThe total ending IDA balance was $147.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, and $154.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. Were IDA balances to decline below the required IDA balance minimum, Schwab could be required to direct additional sweep cash from its balance sheet to the IDA program. Through December 31, 2021, Schwab had moved $10.1 billion of IDA balances to its balance sheet, which included uninsured balances and certain international account balances. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, the Company moved approximately $10 billion of additional IDA balances to its balance sheet.",

      "question": "How did Capital One's (COF) fixed unsecured senior debt evolve from 2022 through 2024 in terms of carrying value and weighted-average interest rate, and what does this progression suggest about the company's debt strategy in a rising interest rate environment?",
      "answer": "Capital One's fixed unsecured senior debt increased from a carrying value of $19,975 million in 2022 to $27,168 million in 2023, then slightly declined to $26,930 million in 2024. The weighted-average interest rate rose from 2.91% in 2022 to 4.45% in 2023, and further to 4.84% in 2024. This indicates a strategy of locking in long-term debt at increasingly higher rates as market conditions changed, suggesting a proactive approach to anticipated rate hikes.",

      "question": "How did Capital One's (COF) total short-term borrowings and long-term debt evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this progression reveal about its debt structure and interest rate exposure, particularly in relation to floating unsecured senior debt?",
      "answer": "Capital One's total short-term borrowings and long-term debt increased from $43.086 billion in 2022 to $49.856 billion in 2023, then declined slightly to $45.551 billion in 2024. This trajectory reflects a significant shift in debt composition: in 2022, floating unsecured senior debt stood at $1.709 billion with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.01%, rising sharply in 2023 to $349 million with a much higher rate of 6.75%, and then dropping to $0 in 2024 as the company eliminated this category. Meanwhile, fixed unsecured senior debt increased from $27.168 billion in 2023 to $26.930 billion in 2024 (from $21.045 billion in 2022), with a rising weighted-average interest rate from 2.91% in 2022 to 4.84% in 2024. This evolution indicates a strategic pivot from floating to fixed-rate debt to mitigate interest rate risk in a rising rate environment.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Capital One reported net derivative assets/liabilities at a fair value of $19 million, with a net unrealized loss of $20 million still held as of year-end. By 2023, the fair value of net derivative assets/liabilities was disclosed at $58 million, with unobservable inputs including default rates (53\u2013163%) and swap rates (3\u20135%) factored into the valuation. In 2024, the company maintained the same $58 million fair value for net derivative assets/liabilities, with continued reliance on swap rates (3\u20135%) as a key unobservable input. This indicates a transformation in valuation methodology from a mixed realized/unrealized loss position in 2022 to a more stable fair value by 2023\u20132024, with increasing transparency and reliance on structured unobservable inputs, particularly swap rates, signaling a more defined risk profile around derivative exposures.",

      "answer": "Capital One's total senior and subordinated notes had a carrying value of $27,219 million in 2022, increased to $31,248 million in 2023, and then slightly decreased to $30,696 million in 2024. This indicates a strategic shift toward issuing more fixed unsecured senior debt with higher interest rates, reflecting a response to rising market rates and a potential pivot toward longer-term financing. The weighted-average interest rate on total unsecured senior debt rose from 2.76% in 2022 to 4.48% in 2023 and further to 4.84% in 2024, showing a clear trend toward more expensive but stable funding sources.",

The weighted-average interest rate rose from 2.91% in 2022 to 4.45% in 2023, then slightly declined to 4.84% in 2024. This indicates a strategy shift toward issuing more fixed-rate debt at higher interest rates, likely to capitalize on favorable market conditions or to refinance existing obligations at longer maturities.",

      "answer": "Capital One's total short-term borrowings and long-term debt increased from $43.086 billion in 2022 to $48.715 billion in 2023, and further to $45.551 billion in 2024. This reflects a significant rise in debt levels, particularly in 2023, followed by a slight decline in 2024. The weighted-average interest rate on long-term debt also increased, from 1.51% on securitized debt in 2022 to 3.01% in 2023 and 3.48% in 2024, indicating rising borrowing costs over the period. Additionally, the company reduced its floating unsecured senior debt from $1,597 million in 2023 to $0 in 2024, signaling a strategic shift away from variable-rate debt amid rising interest rates.",

      "answer": "Capital One's net derivative assets/liabilities had a fair value of $31 million in 2022, increased to $58 million in 2023, and remained at $58 million in 2024, indicating a significant increase in valuation over the period. In 2022, the net derivative assets/liabilities included a net unrealized loss of $20 million still held, while in 2023 and 2024, the valuation relied on discounted cash flows with unobservable inputs focused on swap rates (3-5%) and default rates (53-163%), showing a strategic shift toward more interest rate-sensitive instruments and refined modeling assumptions. This trajectory suggests growing exposure to interest rate risk and a more structured approach to derivative valuation.",

        "Hop 1: [COF](2022) \u2192 [Net derivative assets (liabilities)]: Fair value of $31 million with a net unrealized loss of $20 million still held as of December 31, 2021.",

        "Hop 3: [COF](2024) \u2192 [Net derivative assets (liabilities)]: Fair value remained at $58 million, with continued reliance on swap rates (3-5%) as a key unobservable input, indicating sustained sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations."

      "question": "How did American Express's growing reliance on aggregators from 2022 to 2024 expose the company to increasing legal and merchant discrimination risks, particularly in light of the potential impact of Visa and Mastercard's interchange fee proposals on merchant surcharging practices?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express's reliance on aggregators increased, exposing the company to greater legal and merchant discrimination risks. In 2022, AXP acknowledged its dependence on aggregators and processors to manage merchant relationships and promote card acceptance, but noted that these third parties may have conflicting business interests. By 2023, AXP explicitly stated that it was 'increasingly reliant' on aggregators, and that merchant discrimination against American Express cards\u2014such as steering customers toward other payment methods\u2014could become more prevalent with the introduction of debit cards on the AXP network. In 2024, AXP faced heightened legal exposure, including potential changes to merchant agreements due to litigation, which could lead to increased merchant steering and discrimination. This was compounded by developments involving Visa and Mastercard, which proposed a settlement that would have capped interchange fees and streamlined surcharging rules, potentially increasing surcharging on credit cards and putting downward pressure on AXP\u2019s merchant discount rates. The combination of increased dependence on aggregators and evolving competitive and regulatory dynamics around surcharging and interchange fees created a more complex and risky environment for AXP over the three-year period.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nprohibiting discrimination through provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, subject to local legal requirements. When we work with merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage certain aspects of the merchant relationship, we are dependent on them to promote and support the acceptance and usage of our cards, but such third parties may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\n\nNew products, such as debit cards on the American Express network, could fail to gain market acceptance and American Express cards could become less desirable to consumers and businesses generally due to surcharging, steering or other forms of discrimination, which could result in a decrease in cards-in-force and transaction volumes. The impact could vary depending on such factors as: the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied; how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale; the ease and speed of implementation for merchants, including as a result of new or emerging technologies; the size and recurrence of the underlying charges; and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment, including whether it varies depending on the type of card (e.g., credit or debit), product, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business.\n\n## We may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion, merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and services, or to effectively control the costs of such investments, both of which may materially impact our profitability.\n\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, retain existing Card Members and capture a greater share of customers' total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments will continue to be effective, particularly with changing consumer and business behaviors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage or merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards, our business could suffer. Expanding our service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, fail to resonate with customers, adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand.\n\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on third parties for certain redemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future, which could diminish the value of the program for our Card Members. Our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. In addition, many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours. Our inability to differentiate our products and services could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future. If such expenses increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues, decreasing operating expenses or other investments in our business, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment. In addition, increased costs as a result of inflation, colleague retention and recruitment, supply chain issues and shortages of materials such as chips for our cards, and readiness efforts for returning to our offices may require that we reduce investments in other areas.\n\n## Our brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\n\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and realize the benefits of the value of our brand. Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, privacy and data protection, management, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, financial condition, response to political and social issues or catastrophic events (including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters) and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters - even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct-could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members, corporate clients, merchants and partners, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of customer information, conduct by our colleagues and policy engagement, including activities of the American Express Company Political Action Committee, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto. Discussion about such matters in social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand.",

Many of these actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages and require us to incur significant costs for legal representation, arbitration fees or other legal or related services. While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our ex posure to class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future, including as a result of legal challenges to, and new regulations affecting, our arbitration provisions, and claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities, risks and costs associated with class action cases. The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation.\n\nWe expect that financial institutions, such as us, will continue to face significant regulatory scrutiny, with regulators taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non-public supervisory actions or findings, which could involve restrictions on our activities, among other limitations, that could adversely affect our business. In addition, a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us. Further, a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings. External publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries.\n\nWe are also involved at any given time with governmental and regulatory inquiries, investigations and proceedings. Regulatory scrutiny has continued to increase in a number of areas, and regulatory action could subject us to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in Card Member reimbursements, increased expenses, limitations or conditions on our business activities, and damage to our reputation and our brand, all of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. For example, as previously disclosed, we entered into agreements to resolve governmental investigations related to historical sales practices for certain U.S. small business customers, which are described in more detail in Note 12 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements.' In addition, we are cooperating with ongoing regulatory inquiries concerning our rewards and benefits programs, as described in 'Supervision and Regulation' under 'Business.'\n\nLegal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, changes to our merchant agreements and/or business practices, substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand.\n\nWe are, and have been in the past, a defendant in a number of actions, including legal proceedings, arbitrations and proposed class actions, challenging certain provisions of our card acceptance agreements. See Note 12 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for a description of certain outstanding legal proceedings.\n\nAn adverse outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member experience, result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand. Even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements, changes in Visa's and Mastercard's policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings, lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions pending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability. For example, in 2024 Visa and Mastercard proposed a lawsuit settlement agreement that would have, among other things, required reductions and caps on interchange fees and streamlined requirements for merchants who wish to impose a surcharge on credit transactions. While the settlement agreement was not approved by the court, Visa and Mastercard may ultimately agree or be subject to changes in policies or practices that result in greater surcharging generally or downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with reductions and caps on interchange fees.\n\n## We rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business.\n\nWe rely on third-party service providers, cobrand partners, merchants, affiliate marketing firms, processors, aggregators, network partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business. As outsourcing, specialization of functions, third-party digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase (including with respect to mobile technologies, tokenization, big data, artificial intelligence and cloud-based solutions), more third parties are involved in processing card transactions, handling our data and supporting our operations. For example, we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network, card acquisition and provision of services to our customers.\n\nWe have experienced in certain limited circumstances and may continue to experience disruptions or other events at our third parties or our third parties' service providers, including their failure to fulfill their obligations and the information, cybersecurity and operational incidents described above. Such disruptions or other events could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers, impact the confidentiality, integrity, availability and security of our data, lead to fraudulent transactions on our cards or other products, impact our business, cause brand or reputational damage, and lead to costs associated with responding to such a disruption, including notification and remediation costs, costs to switch service providers or move operations in house, regulatory investigations and fines and increased regulatory oversight and litigation. Third parties may face similar or greater risks as us, including as a result of their relationship with us; however, they may be less prepared to mitigate those risks and may be",

      "question": "How has American Express's competitive positioning relative to other card networks evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in light of increasing regulatory scrutiny and the expansion of alternative payment mechanisms?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express maintained its position as the fourth-largest general-purpose card network globally behind China UnionPay, Visa, and Mastercard. In 2022 and 2023, the company emphasized its competitive differentiation through premium offerings, cobrand relationships, and closed-loop loyalty systems, while facing growing pressure from alternative payment platforms like Alipay, PayPal, and buy-now-pay-later services. By 2024, regulatory scrutiny intensified, particularly around interchange fees, network routing practices, and cobrand arrangements in the EU, leading to exits from certain markets and increased compliance costs. This evolution indicates a shift from primarily market-driven competition to a more regulation-constrained environment, which has altered the strategic dynamics of its relationship with card networks.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nWe compete in the global payments industry with card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks), bank transfer models (e.g., wire transfers and Automated Clearing House, or ACH), as well as evolving and growing alternative mechanisms, systems and products that leverage new technologies, business models and customer relationships to create payment or financing solutions. The payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies, consumer habits and merchant needs, some of which have accelerated as a result of the pandemic, such as an increased shift to e-commerce and demand for contactless payments.\n\nAs a card issuer, we compete with financial institutions that issue general-purpose credit and debit cards. We also encounter competition from businesses that issue private label cards, operate mobile wallets or extend credit. We face intense competition in the premium space and for cobrand relationships, as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted high-spending customers and key business partners with attractive value propositions. We also face competition for partners and other differentiated offerings, such as lounge space in U.S. and global hub airports.\n\nOur global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks, including, among others, China UnionPay, Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover and Diners Club International (which is owned by Discover). We are the fourth largest general-purpose card network globally based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and Mastercard. In addition to such networks, a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers, processors and web- and mobile-based payment platforms (e.g., Alipay, PayPal and Venmo), as well as regional payment networks (such as the National Payments Corporation of India), carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMNS business.\n\nThe principal competitive factors that affect the card-issuing, merchant and network businesses include:\n\n- The features, value and quality of the products and services, including customer care, rewards programs, partnerships, travel and lifestyle-related benefits, and digital and mobile services, as well as the costs associated with providing such features and services\n- Reputation and brand recognition\n- The number, spending characteristics and credit performance of customers\n- The quantity, diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used\n- The attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers, merchant acquirers, cardholders, corporate clients and merchants (including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services, and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics)\n- The number and quality of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers\n- The success of marketing and promotional campaigns\n- The speed of innovation and investment in systems, technologies, and product and service offerings\n- The nature and quality of expense management tools, electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities, particularly for business customers\n- The security of cardholder, merchant and network partner information\n\nAnother aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products, which include payment aggregators, digital payment and electronic wallet platforms, point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products, real-time settlement and processing systems, financial technology companies, digital currencies developed by both central banks and the private sector, blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies, prepaid systems and gift cards, and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions. Various competitors are integrating more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are seeking to attain the benefits of closed-loop, loyalty and rewards functionalities, such as ours.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nand regulations impact the scope and profitability of our existing business activities, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities and adopt new technologies, compromise our competitive position, and affect our relationships with Card Members, partners, merchants, service providers and other third parties. New laws or regulations could similarly affect our business, increase the costs and complexity of doing business, impact what we are able to charge for, or offer in connection with, our products and services, impose conflicting obligations, and require us to change certain of our business practices and invest significant management attention and resources, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Political developments can result in legislative and regulatory uncertainty and changes to supervisory and enforcement priorities. In addition, legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other's approaches to the regulation of the financial services industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another.\n\nIf we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or engage in certain business activities or acquisitions, which could compromise our competitive position. Additionally, our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital. In 2024, we became a Category III firm for purposes of the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies' tailoring framework, resulting in us becoming subject to heightened regulatory expectations and more stringent regulatory requirements. As we continue to grow, these expectations and requirements may further increase, such as if we become a Category II firm, which may increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business.\n\nLegislators and regulators continue to focus on the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard, network routing practices and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. While in some cases our business is subject to exemptions related to certain of these regulations, there is no guarantee that such ex emptions will continue to be available and even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees significantly negatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend, or may extend, to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements, new products or services we may offer, or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-all-cards. For example, we have exited our network licensing businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. See 'Supervision and Regulation - Payments Regulation' under 'Business' for more information. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, a number of federal and state laws to regulate various aspects of network operations are being considered or have passed, including regarding information associated with electronic transactions (such as the use of specific merchant categories codes or limitations on the use of transaction data) and pricing of electronic transactions (such as interchange fees on sales tax  or gratuities).\n\nLegislators and regulators also continue to focus on consumer protection, including product design and pricing constructs, account management and security, credit bureau reporting, disclosure rules, marketing and debt collection practices. This focus has included fees associated with card and banking products, such as a rule issued by the CFPB related to credit card fees for late payments (which is currently stayed); interest rates, such as recent proposals to cap credit card interest rates; rewards programs, such as the recent inquiries by the CFPB and DOT focused on credit card and airline rewards programs; and factors considered by financial institutions in providing services, such as 'fair access' laws. Any new requirements or increased enforcement of existing requirements could materially and adversely impact our revenue growth and profitability, including, as a result of increased scrutiny of our pricing, underwriting and account management practices; the imposition of fines and customer remediation; higher compliance costs; reputational harm; restrictions on our ability to issue cards, appropriately price for the value of our products or work with certain business partners; and changes to our business practices generally.\n\nWe are subject to significant supervision and regulation with respect to compliance with AML/CFT laws, sanctions regimes and anti-corruption laws in numerous jurisdictions. As regulators increase their focus in these areas, new technologies such as digital currencies develop, near real-time money movement solutions are adopted, we introduce new products like checking accounts and geopolitical tensions increase, we face increased costs related to oversight, supervision and potential fines. Our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny, and we are working to make enhancements to our existing programs, policies and procedures and to identify and remediate deficiencies. For example, we recently voluntarily reported certain transactions and accounts to OFAC, some of which related to Iran, as described in 'Supervision and Regulation - Anti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Compliance' under 'Business.' Errors, failures or delays in complying with AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, deficiencies in our related compliance programs or association of our business with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud or other illicit activities or sanctioned persons, entities, governments or countries can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits, which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets, loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities, or other enforcement actions, and our reputation may suffer due to our customers' association with certain countries, persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions.

      "question": "How did American Express's yield profile from its holdings of foreign government bonds and obligations evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this 3-year progression indicate about its exposure to interest rate risk and investment strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, American Express held $630 million in foreign government bonds and obligations, with $628 million maturing within one year and the remainder evenly split between 1\u20135 years and 5\u201310 years. In 2023, the weighted average yield on these holdings was 6.45%, concentrated entirely in securities maturing within one year. By 2024, the yield had decreased to 5.85%, with a significant portion (2.03%) now maturing between 1 and 5 years. This indicates a shift in investment strategy\u2014moving from ultra-short-duration, high-yield foreign debt in 2023 to a more diversified maturity profile by 2024, potentially to manage interest rate risk while maintaining relatively high yields compared to other asset classes.",

      "answer": "In 2022, American Express's relationship with third-party merchant acquirers was primarily transactional, with revenue recognized as discount revenue based on negotiated network rate fees under programs like OptBlue and Global Network Services (GNS) partnerships. By 2023, the company had formalized these relationships further, integrating third-party acquirers into a broader 'Processed Revenue' model that included royalties, fees, and network partnership agreements, indicating a more strategic and structured revenue-sharing framework. In 2024, American Express emphasized the importance of third-party acquirers in its global merchant expansion strategy, particularly in increasing card acceptance in low- and new-to-plastic industries and international markets. This evolution shows a shift from a transactional dependency to a more strategic partnership model aimed at scaling global acceptance and enhancing network value.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nAccounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management's assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ.\n\n## INCOME STATEMENT\n\n## Discount Revenue\n\nDiscount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\n\nThe card acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network.\n\nIn cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on behalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other revenue.\n\nRevenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) is not required to be disclosed. Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material.\n\n## Net Card Fees\n\nNet card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore more stable in relation to short term business or economic shifts. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nEffective April 1, 2021, we prospectively changed the recognition of certain costs paid to a third party previously recognized over the twelve month card membership period in Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income; such costs are now recorded as incurred in Marketing and business development expense. This change is not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Fees and Commissions\n\nOther fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other fees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express faced a growing and increasingly diverse set of alternative payment mechanisms. In 2022, the company identified a range of competitors including payment aggregators, digital wallets (e.g., Alipay, PayPal, Venmo), buy now pay later platforms, and blockchain-based systems. By 2023, this list expanded to include open banking platforms, reflecting a broader technological landscape. In 2024, rather than just competing, American Express demonstrated a strategic pivot by emphasizing investment in and integration of these alternative mechanisms, including open banking, digital identification, and real-time settlement systems, indicating a shift from viewing them solely as threats to potential components of its own innovation strategy. This evolution shows a transition from a defensive posture to a more adaptive, technology-driven approach.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nWe compete in the global payments industry with card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks), bank transfer models (e.g., wire transfers and Automated Clearing House, or ACH), as well as evolving and growing alternative mechanisms, systems and products that leverage new technologies, business models and customer relationships to create payment or financing solutions. The payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies, consumer habits and merchant needs, some of which have accelerated as a result of the pandemic, such as an increased shift to e-commerce and demand for contactless payments.\n\nAs a card issuer, we compete with financial institutions that issue general-purpose credit and debit cards. We also encounter competition from businesses that issue private label cards, operate mobile wallets or extend credit. We face intense competition in the premium space and for cobrand relationships, as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted high-spending customers and key business partners with attractive value propositions. We also face competition for partners and other differentiated offerings, such as lounge space in U.S. and global hub airports.\n\nOur global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks, including, among others, China UnionPay, Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover and Diners Club International (which is owned by Discover). We are the fourth largest general-purpose card network globally based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and Mastercard. In addition to such networks, a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers, processors and web- and mobile-based payment platforms (e.g., Alipay, PayPal and Venmo), as well as regional payment networks (such as the National Payments Corporation of India), carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMNS business.\n\nThe principal competitive factors that affect the card-issuing, merchant and network businesses include:\n\n- The features, value and quality of the products and services, including customer care, rewards programs, partnerships, travel and lifestyle-related benefits, and digital and mobile services, as well as the costs associated with providing such features and services\n- Reputation and brand recognition\n- The number, spending characteristics and credit performance of customers\n- The quantity, diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used\n- The attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers, merchant acquirers, cardholders, corporate clients and merchants (including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services, and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics)\n- The number and quality of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers\n- The success of marketing and promotional campaigns\n- The speed of innovation and investment in systems, technologies, and product and service offerings\n- The nature and quality of expense management tools, electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities, particularly for business customers\n- The security of cardholder, merchant and network partner information\n\nAnother aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products, which include payment aggregators, digital payment and electronic wallet platforms, point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products, real-time settlement and processing systems, financial technology companies, digital currencies developed by both central banks and the private sector, blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies, prepaid systems and gift cards, and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions. Various competitors are integrating more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are seeking to attain the benefits of closed-loop, loyalty and rewards functionalities, such as ours.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nreferring to the United States, a negative perception of the United States arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand. These risks to our brand and reputation, as well as other risks described in this Risk Factors section, are heightened by the increasing sophistication and availability of artificial intelligence technology, including by assisting with the creation of deepfakes and increasing the velocity of distribution of disinformation. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our business volumes, revenues and profitability.\n\nWe face increased scrutiny from stakeholders who have diverging views related to business practices and company activities, which could result in reputational harm, litigation, enforcement actions and other adverse consequences. In addition, we are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and legal risks related to environmental, social and governance topics, such as those arising from new disclosure requirements in certain jurisdictions. Inaccurate perceptions or mischaracterizations of disclosures on these topics, or our goals and initiatives, while outside of our control, could impact our reputation, colleague hiring and retention and public perceptions of our business.\n\n## If we are not able to successfully invest in, and compete with respect to, technological developments and new products and services across all our businesses, our revenue and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in technology across all areas of our business, including in transaction processing, data management and analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, customer interactions and communications, open banking and alternative payment and financing mechanisms, authentication technologies and digital identification, tokenization, real-time settlement and risk management and compliance systems. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services, including developing the appropriate governance and controls consistent with regulatory expectations, requires substantial expenditures and takes considerable time, and may have unintended consequences or ultimately be unsuccessful. We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, our ex isting technology.\n\nThe process of developing new products and services, enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may develop products, platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted by consumers, merchants or service providers than ours, including as a result of increased involvement by technology companies in the payments industry and our competitors' greater scale or ability to pursue and adopt new technologies. In addition, we may underestimate the resources needed and overestimate our ability to develop new products and services, particularly beyond our traditional card products and travel-related services.\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, including generative artificial intelligence, has increased rapidly with the increasing sophistication and applications of the technology. Our and our partners' use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is subject to various risks including flaws in models or datasets that may result in biased or inaccurate results, unintended or unexpected outcomes, ethical considerations regarding artificial intelligence, infringement of intellectual property rights, ex posure of proprietary or personal information, heightened security risks and the ability to safely deploy and implement governance and controls for artificial intelligence systems. The complex ity of these technologies can make it difficult to assess proper operation, reduce error, or understand and explain their outputs. Adverse consequences of artificial intelligence and machine learning remain uncertain but could include flaws in the decisions, predictions, outputs or analysis such technologies produce and subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm.\n\nOur ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the emergence of industry-wide standards, a changing legislative and regulatory environment, an inability to develop appropriate governance and controls, a lack of internal product and engineering expertise, resistance to change from Card Members, merchants or service providers, lack of appropriate change management processes or the complexity of our systems. In addition, our adoption of new technologies and our introduction of new products and services may increase operational complexity and risk, and expose us to new or enhanced risks, particularly in areas where we have less experience or our existing governance and control systems may be insufficient, which could require us to make substantial expenditures or subject us to legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm.\n\n## We may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and investment activity, and our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments, and continue to evaluate potential transactions. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, value potential investment or acquisition opportunities accurately, negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, or complete proposed acquisitions and investments. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including in integrating systems and personnel or further developing the acquired business or technology, result in unanticipated liabilities, including legal claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes and information security vulnerabilities or breaches (including from not integrating the acquired company, business or technology quickly or appropriately, from activities that occurred prior to the acquisition, from inadequate systems or controls of the acquired company, and from exposure to third party relationships of the acquired company or business or new laws and regulations), and harm our business generally. Expanding to new businesses, geographies or customer types through acquisitions may subject us to new risks and we may not have the relevant expertise or business structure to achieve the desired results. It may take us longer than ex pected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results, including as a result of write-downs of goodwill and other intangible assets.",

      "question": "How did Capital One's (COF) total senior and subordinated notes evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression reveal about its capital structure strategy and interest rate positioning over this period?",
      "answer": "Capital One's total senior and subordinated notes increased from $27,219 million in 2022 to $31,248 million in 2023, then slightly declined to $30,696 million in 2024. The weighted-average interest rate on fixed unsecured senior debt rose from 2.91% in 2022 to 4.45% in 2023 and further to 4.84% in 2024, indicating a shift toward higher-cost debt issuance as interest rates rose across the period. The reduction in floating unsecured senior debt from $1,709 million in 2022 to $349 million in 2023 and its complete retirement by 2024 suggests a strategic pivot away from floating-rate liabilities amid rising benchmark rates. This evolution shows a capital structure adjustment to lock in higher fixed rates, likely anticipating continued rate hikes.",

      "answer": "COF's total short-term borrowings and long-term debt increased from $43.086 billion in 2022 to $48.715 billion in 2023, then declined to $45.551 billion in 2024. The weighted-average interest rate on long-term debt rose from 2.76% in 2022 to 4.48% in 2023, and further to 4.84% in 2024, indicating a shift toward higher-cost fixed-rate debt. This suggests COF initially expanded its debt footprint amid rising rates, then began reducing overall leverage while maintaining a higher fixed-rate exposure to stabilize financing costs.",

      "question": "How did Capital One's net derivative assets/liabilities evolve from 2022 to 2024 in terms of fair value and key valuation inputs, and what does this progression indicate about the company's exposure to interest rate and credit risk?",
      "answer": "Capital One's net derivative assets/liabilities showed a shift in fair value and risk profile across the three years. In 2022, the fair value was $31 million, with a net decline to $19 million by the end of 2023, reflecting a $43 million unrealized loss during the year. By 2024, the fair value rebounded to $58 million, indicating a significant increase in derivative exposure. The valuation inputs also evolved: in 2022, the primary unobservable input was default rates (53-163%), signaling credit risk sensitivity. By 2023 and 2024, the focus shifted toward swap rates (3-5%), highlighting increased sensitivity to interest rate risk. This evolution suggests a strategic shift from credit risk exposure to interest rate risk exposure over the three-year period.",

        "Hop 1: [COF](2023) \u2192 [Net derivative assets (liabilities)]: Fair value declined to $19 million with continued use of discounted cash flow models and increasing emphasis on swap rates as key valuation input",

      "answer": "Visa Inc. consistently disclosed the specimen certificate for class C common stock in its filings across 2022, 2023, and 2024, referencing it under Exhibit 4.2 in each year. In 2022, the exhibit was listed as 'Form of specimen certificate for class C common stock of Visa Inc.' and was incorporated by reference from an 8-A filing dated January 28, 2009. In 2023, the same exhibit number (4.2) was used, maintaining the same description and reference source. By 2024, the exhibit remained under Exhibit 4.2, though the description was slightly reformatted as 'Form of specimen certificate for class C common stock of Visa Inc.' with the same incorporation by reference from the 8-A filing on January 28, 2009. This consistency indicates no substantive change in the regulatory documentation related to the class C common stock certificate over the three-year period.",

In 2024, virtual accounts were a core component of Visa\u2019s digitally native capabilities, supporting a network with the potential to reach over 11 billion endpoints across cards, bank accounts, and digital wallets, and were central to Visa\u2019s strategy for addressing $20 trillion in annual B2B cross-border opportunities.

Visa Direct connected 16 card-based networks, 66 automated clearing house (ACH) schemes, 11 real-time payment (RTP) networks and five gateways. With the addition of push-to-wallet capabilities to Visa Direct Payouts, which is an existing service that allows Visa financial institutions  and  its  partners  to  send  push-to-account  and  push-to-card  payouts,  Visa  Direct  will  be  able  to  provide access to nearly 7 billion cards, accounts and digital wallets across more than 190 countries and territories.\n\n## Visa Business Solutions\n\nWe are also extending our network with B2B payments.

      "question": "How did Visa's stock certificate documentation evolve across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings, particularly regarding class designations, and what does this progression suggest about the company's capital structure strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Visa's filings included the Form of specimen certificate for Class B common stock (Exhibit 4.2) and Class C common stock (Exhibit 4.3), showing the company maintained multiple share classes. By 2023, only the Class C common stock certificate remained in the exhibit list (Exhibit 4.2), suggesting a simplification of the capital structure. This change was solidified in the 2024 filings, which exclusively referenced Class C common stock documentation without any mention of Class B shares. The progression indicates a strategic move toward consolidating share classes, likely to streamline ownership structure and improve corporate governance clarity.",

      "question": "How has BNY Mellon's exposure to U.S. banking laws affecting capital return flexibility evolved from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to regulatory constraints on dividend payments and share repurchases?",
      "answer": "BNY Mellon's exposure to U.S. banking laws affecting capital return flexibility has remained consistently constrained by regulatory oversight across the three-year period. In 2022, the company noted that its ability to return capital was limited by U.S. banking laws governing capital adequacy and planning, Delaware law, and preferred stock dividend obligations. In 2023, these constraints were reiterated, with emphasis on the impact of potential credit rating reductions and resolution strategies under Title I and II on liquidity and financial condition. By 2024, the company continued to highlight the same regulatory limitations on capital returns, while also expanding the context to include liquidity management and the impact of strategic initiatives on financial stability. The consistent emphasis across all three years shows a stable regulatory environment with persistent constraints on capital distribution flexibility.",

      "answer": "In 2022, BNY Mellon disclosed the ratification of KPMG LLP as the principal accountant, including KPMG's PCAOB firm identification number (185), and referenced the Proxy section 'Item 3 - Ratification of KPMG LLP' for detailed information. In 2023, the structure of the Proxy incorporation remained consistent, with the same PCAOB ID (185) disclosed, but the formatting of the sections was more compact and emphasized clarity in the presentation of related content. By 2024, the company continued to reference the same Proxy section for ratification details, maintained the PCAOB ID (185), and further streamlined the presentation of incorporated sections, particularly around governance and compensation analysis. This indicates a consistent relationship with KPMG LLP over the three years, with gradual improvements in disclosure formatting and structure.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Visa progressively integrated and expanded virtual accounts as part of its cross-border payment solutions. In 2022, virtual accounts were introduced as part of Visa Treasury as a Service, enhancing cross-border consumer payment capabilities through real-time foreign exchange rates and improved liquidity and settlement features. By 2023, Visa had incorporated virtual accounts into the Visa Direct platform, which processed nearly 10 billion transactions in fiscal 2023 for over 550 partners, signaling a strategic push to digitize and streamline B2B and cross-border flows. In 2024, Visa continued to build on this momentum, maintaining the scale of Visa Direct and expanding its digitally native Currencycloud capabilities, which included virtual accounts as a core feature to service new and existing cross-border payment flows. This evolution reflects Visa's deepening commitment to embedding virtual account functionality across its global payment infrastructure.",

This indicates that the Series B instrument has remained a static but integral component of Visa\u2019s capital structure over the three-year period, with no modifications required or implemented. The consistent citation of the same exhibit number and filing date across all three years suggests that Visa has maintained the same terms and conditions for this preferred stock, signaling long-term strategic stability in its capital governance framework despite evolving market conditions.",

      "question": "How has Visa's treatment and disclosure of its Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock evolved across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings, and what does this multi-year pattern suggest about its capital structure stability and disclosure priorities?",
      "answer": "Visa's disclosure of the Certificate of Designations of Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock remained consistent in content across all three years, with the exhibit consistently referenced as 8-K filings under exhibit number 3.1 and filed on June 21, 2016, in both the 2023 and 2024 filings. In 2022, the same certificate was listed under exhibit number 4.4, indicating a reclassification of exhibit numbers between 2022 and 2023. Despite this internal reorganization of exhibit numbering, the underlying documentation and filing date for the Series A preferred stock remained unchanged across all three years. This pattern suggests that while Visa has maintained a stable capital structure with no substantive changes to its preferred stock terms, it has undergone a procedural reorganization of its disclosure framework, likely to enhance clarity or align with evolving regulatory or internal reporting standards.",

      "question": "How has Visa's structure of stock certificates evolved from 2022 through 2024, particularly with respect to class-specific specimen certificates, and what does this progression indicate about the company's equity classification strategy?",
      "answer": "Visa's stock certificate structure remained largely consistent across the three years, but with notable changes in class-specific specimen certificates. In 2022, Visa included forms for class B and class C common stock certificates (Exhibit 4.2 and 4.3). By 2023, the company referenced only class C common stock in its specimen certificate (Exhibit 4.2), dropping explicit mention of class B. This change persisted in 2024, where the filing again listed a form for class C common stock but omitted class B entirely. This evolution suggests a simplification or consolidation of equity classifications, aligning with a more streamlined capital structure over time.",

        "Hop 1: V(2023) \u2192 Form of stock certificate: Includes 'Form of specimen certificate for class C common stock' (Exhibit 4.2), but no class B certificate is listed.",

        "Hop 3: V(2022) \u2192 Form of stock certificate: Listed both 'class B common stock' (Exhibit 4.2) and 'class C common stock' (Exhibit 4.3), indicating a more differentiated equity structure."

      "answer": "In 2022, Visa introduced virtual accounts as part of its Treasury as a Service initiative, emphasizing their role in enabling cross-border products and services through the Currencycloud platform. By 2023, virtual accounts were fully integrated into the Visa Direct Platform, supporting new flows and enhancing the established cross-border consumer payments business with real-time foreign exchange rates and improved liquidity and settlement capabilities. In 2024, virtual accounts continued to be a core component of the Visa Direct Platform, further solidifying their role in facilitating cross-border transactions and supporting Visa\u2019s broader network of more than 11 billion endpoints, including cards, bank accounts, and digital wallets.",

Visa  Direct  leverages  Visa's  infrastructure  to  enable  different transaction types and new money flows between parties for a wide range of use cases, such as P2P payments and account-to-account  transfers,  business  and  government  payouts  to  individuals  and  small  businesses,  merchant settlements and refunds. (2)\n\nIn fiscal year 2022, we had 5.9 billion Visa Direct transactions, an increase of 36 percent year over year, excluding Russia from both periods, and more than 60 use cases and 2,000 programs.

      "question": "Based on Visa's filings from 2022 through 2024, how has the company's treatment of its Series B Convertible Participating Preferred Stock evolved, and what does this continuity suggest about its long-term capital structure priorities?",
      "answer": "Visa's treatment of its Series B Convertible Participating Preferred Stock has remained unchanged from 2022 through 2024, as evidenced by its consistent reference to the same Certificate of Designations dated June 21, 2016, across all three annual filings. This lack of modification suggests that Visa has maintained a stable capital structure strategy over this period, prioritizing continuity in its preferred equity instruments. The persistent inclusion of the Series B certificate indicates a deliberate choice to preserve existing shareholder rights and financing flexibility, rather than altering the terms or introducing new preferred stock series. This consistency aligns with a broader pattern of stability in Visa's capital management approach, as seen in its unchanged Bylaws (2022 filing) and the 2024 update to its Certificate of Incorporation without changes to the Series B structure.",

      "question": "How has Visa maintained consistency in its class C common stock certificate documentation from 2022 to 2024, and what might this stability suggest about the company's approach to corporate governance and investor relations during a period of broader regulatory and market evolution?",
      "answer": "Visa has consistently referenced the same Form of Specimen Certificate for Class C Common Stock across its 10-K filings for 2022, 2023, and 2024, with each year citing Exhibit 4.2 filed on January 28, 2009 (8-A, File Number 000-53572). Despite broader changes in corporate governance practices and evolving regulatory environments, Visa has not updated or modified its documentation for Class C common stock certificates. This long-term consistency suggests a deliberate approach to maintaining stable investor relations practices and implies confidence in the adequacy of its existing governance framework for equity instruments. The lack of changes also contrasts with updates seen in other governance documents like the Certificate of Incorporation (revised in 2024) and indicates that Visa has not found it necessary to alter its stock certificate structure despite market and regulatory shifts.",

      "question": "How did Charles Schwab's use of client securities as collateral evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to margin lending and securities lending activities, and what does this trend indicate about the firm's balance sheet strategy and client leverage behavior?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab disclosed that client securities could be pledged as collateral under federal regulations for margin loans, though specific pledged amounts were not quantified. In 2023, Schwab provided more detailed disclosures around margin lending, including the collateral maintenance process and the ability to pledge client securities, while also mentioning that client-held fractional shares were included in other securities owned. By 2024, Schwab explicitly stated that it pledges client securities to meet margin requirements for listed option contracts cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation and to satisfy collateral requirements in securities lending activities. This progression shows an increasing formalization and expansion of client securities usage, indicating a strategic shift toward leveraging client assets for operational and capital efficiency, while also reflecting rising client participation in leveraged products.",

We satisfy the margin requirements of these transactions through pledging certain client securities. For additional information on these pledged securities, refer to Note 18. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The Company satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral.\n\nThe Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. The Company's liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the amounts it has posted as collateral. The Company also engages third-party firms to clear clients' futures and options on futures transactions and to facilitate clients' foreign ex change trading, and has agreed to indemnify these firms for any losses that they may incur from the client transactions introduced to them by the Company. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees and indemnifications.\n\nIDA agreement: On May 4, 2023, the Company executed the 2023 IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions that replaced and superseded the previous agreement dated November 24, 2019, as amended. The 2023 IDA agreement specifies responsibilities, including certain contingent obligations, of the Company going forward. Pursuant to the 2023 IDA agreement, uninvested cash within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. The Company's ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent on multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and certain binding limitations specified in the 2023 IDA agreement. During 2024, Schwab did not move IDA balances to its balance sheet.\n\nThe 2023 IDA agreement extends the agreement term to sweep balances to the TD Depository Institutions through July 1, 2034, and requires that Schwab maintain minimum and maximum IDA balances as follows:\n\n- Through September 10, 2025, Schwab must maintain minimum balances above the total of then-outstanding unmatured fixed-rate obligation amounts, with a maximum of $30 billion above this total amount.

In 2022, Schwab highlighted the Advisor Services website as the core platform for RIAs, offering multi-year archiving of statements, trade confirms, and tax reports, along with document search capabilities. Additionally, Schwab Advisor Portfolio Connect was introduced as a free, simplified portfolio management solution. In 2023, Schwab reiterated the availability of Schwab Advisor Portfolio Connect and emphasized the intuitive modern experience it provides, allowing advisors to manage Schwab accounts without the need to download and reconcile data. In 2024, Schwab continued to emphasize the Advisor Services website as a central hub for RIAs, with continued support for integrations with third-party platforms and the expansion of educational content and thought leadership for advisors turning independent.

In 2023, Schwab disclosed a specific $638 million investment in U.S. State and Municipal Securities within its available-for-sale securities portfolio, indicating a quantifiable allocation to this asset class. By 2024, Schwab reaffirmed its focus on investment-grade quality for these securities, emphasizing continuity in its credit risk management approach.

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)\n\n## Liquidity and Investment Portfolios\n\nSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgagebacked securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgagebacked securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.\n\n## Mortgage Lending Portfolio\n\nThe bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs (discussed below), and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses.\n\nOur residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo).\n\nSchwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. For more information on credit quality indicators relating to Schwab's bank loans, see Item 8 - Note 7.\n\n## Securities and Instrument-Based Lending Portfolios\n\nCollateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option and futures positions, securities lending agreements, and securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements) include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations. Additionally, for margin loans, PALs, options and futures positions, and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position.\n\n## Other Counterparty Exposures\n\nSchwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab's clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to the Company.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nMarket risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by Schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. Schwab is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates within our interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets.\n\nTo manage interest rate risk, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity (EVE) risk. To remain within these limits, we manage the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Management monitors established guidelines to stay within the Company's risk appetite.\n\nOur measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue, bank deposit account fees, or EVE. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes,",

The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs.\n\nWe manage compliance risk through policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, privacy, and employment policies.\n\nPrivacy risk is the risk of unauthorized collection, use, storage, or sharing of personal information, including data incidents and other mismanagement of personal information. We manage privacy risk through policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with these laws and regulations.\n\nAnti-money laundering/sanctions risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)/global sanctions (collectively, 'AML') laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Schwab manages this risk through daily monitoring, a system of internal controls, education and training for appropriate personnel, and developing risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence and complying with beneficial ownership requirements for legal entity customers.\n\nConduct risk arises from inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior of the Company, its employees or third parties acting on the Company's behalf that may result in detriment to the Company's clients, financial markets, the Company, and/or the Company's employees. We manage this risk through policies, procedures, a system of internal controls, including personnel monitoring and surveillance. Conduct-related matters are escalated through appropriate channels by the Company's Corporate Responsibility Officer.\n\nFiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. We manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.\n\nIncentive Compensation risk is the potential for adverse consequences resulting from compensation plans that do not balance the execution of our strategy with risk and financial rewards, potentially encouraging imprudent risk-taking by employees. We have implemented risk management processes, including a policy, to identify, evaluate, assess, and manage risks associated with incentive compensation plans and the activities of certain employees, defined as Covered Employees, who have the authority to ex pose the Company to material amounts of risk.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. Our ex posure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios, mortgage lending, margin lending and client option and futures activities, pledged asset lending, securities lending activities, and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts. To manage the risks of such losses, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting and reviewing credit limits, monitoring credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, PAL, option, and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments.\n\n## Liquidity and Investment Portfolios\n\nSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.",

      "question": "How did Schwab's migration of IDA balances to its balance sheet evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what changes in contractual flexibility under the IDA agreements influenced this pattern?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab moved $10.1 billion of IDA balances to its balance sheet, including uninsured and international account balances. In 2023, Schwab did not move any IDA balances following the replacement of the 2019 IDA agreement with the 2023 IDA agreement, which extended the agreement term through July 1, 2034, and introduced new constraints on minimum and maximum IDA balance requirements. In 2024, Schwab again did not migrate any IDA balances, as the 2023 IDA agreement remained in effect with ongoing restrictions on withdrawals and migration. The evolution reflects a shift from active migration under the 2019 agreement to a more constrained and passive posture under the 2023 agreement, with Schwab aligning its actions with the new contractual limitations.",

          "chunk_text": "\nGuarantees and indemnifications: Schwab has clients that sell (i.e., write) listed option contracts that are cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation - a clearing house that establishes margin requirements on these transactions. We partially satisfy the margin requirements by arranging unsecured standby LOCs, in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation, which are issued by several banks. At December 31, 2021, the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $15 million. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs at December 31, 2021. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The Company satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral.\n\nThe Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. The Company's liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the amounts it has posted as collateral. The Company also engages third-party firms to clear clients' futures and options on futures transactions and to facilitate clients' foreign exchange trading, and has agreed to indemnify these firms for losses that they may incur from the client transactions introduced to them by the Company. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees.\n\nIDA agreement: The Company's IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions became effective on October 6, 2020. The IDA agreement creates responsibilities of the Company and certain contingent obligations. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, uninvested cash within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. Though unlikely, in the event the sweep arrangement fee computation were to result in a negative amount in any given month, Schwab would be required to pay the TD Depository Institutions.\n\nThe IDA agreement also provides that, as of July 1, 2021, Schwab has the option to migrate up to $10 billion of IDA balances every 12 months to Schwab's balance sheet, subject to certain limitations and adjustments. The Company's ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent upon multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and certain binding limitations specified in the IDA agreement, including the requirement that Schwab can only move IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations. In addition, Schwab also must maintain a minimum $50 billion IDA balance through June 2031, and at least 80% of the IDA balances must be designated as fixed-rate obligations through June 2026.\n\nThe total ending IDA balance was $147.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, and $154.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. Were IDA balances to decline below the required IDA balance minimum, Schwab could be required to direct additional sweep cash from its balance sheet to the IDA program. Through December 31, 2021, Schwab had moved $10.1 billion of IDA balances to its balance sheet, which included uninsured balances and certain international account balances. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, the Company moved approximately $10 billion of additional IDA balances to its balance sheet.",

We satisfy the margin requirements of these transactions through pledging certain client securities. For additional information on these pledged securities, refer to Note 18. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The Company satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral.\n\nThe Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. The Company's liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the amounts it has posted as collateral. The Company also engages third-party firms to clear clients' futures and options on futures transactions and to facilitate clients' foreign ex change trading, and has agreed to indemnify these firms for any losses that they may incur from the client transactions introduced to them by the Company. The potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees and indemnifications.\n\nIDA agreement: On May 4, 2023, the Company executed the 2023 IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions that replaced and superseded the previous agreement dated November 24, 2019, as amended. The 2023 IDA agreement specifies responsibilities, including certain contingent obligations, of the Company going forward. Pursuant to the 2023 IDA agreement, uninvested cash within eligible brokerage client accounts is swept off-balance sheet to deposit accounts at the TD Depository Institutions. Schwab provides recordkeeping and support services to the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the deposit accounts for which Schwab receives an aggregate monthly fee. The Company's ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent on multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and certain binding limitations specified in the 2023 IDA agreement. During 2024, Schwab did not move IDA balances to its balance sheet.\n\nThe 2023 IDA agreement extends the agreement term to sweep balances to the TD Depository Institutions through July 1, 2034, and requires that Schwab maintain minimum and maximum IDA balances as follows:\n\n- Through September 10, 2025, Schwab must maintain minimum balances above the total of then-outstanding unmatured fixed-rate obligation amounts, with a maximum of $30 billion above this total amount.

      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios Premium was introduced as a hybrid advisory service combining robo-advice with access to CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNERS, aimed at making financial and investment planning more accessible. By 2023, it was positioned within a broader ecosystem of advisory solutions that included Schwab Wealth Advisory\u2122 and referrals to independent RIAs, with minimum investments starting as low as $5,000, signaling an effort to scale the service across a wider client base. In 2024, the service was further integrated into a comprehensive wealth management framework that included Schwab Personalized Indexing, Schwab Intelligent Income, and the Schwab Plan \u2014 a complimentary digital financial planning tool \u2014 reinforcing a strategy to offer tiered, technology-enabled wealth solutions. This evolution shows Schwab's intent to leverage hybrid advisory models to democratize access to wealth management while maintaining scalability and client personalization.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\nmanaged account offerings have been made available to retail clients beginning in 2021, including two positive impact strategies and a multi-sector income strategy. The positive impact strategies utilize socially responsible investing, or a general investing strategy that considers not only traditional measures of risk and return, but environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) factors as well. We also refer investors who want to utilize a specific third-party money manager to direct a portion of their investment assets to the Schwab Managed Account program. Schwab Intelligent Portfolios , available since 2015, are for clients who are looking to have their assets professionally managed via a fully automated online investment advisory service. Schwab Intelligent Portfolios Premium , a hybrid advisory service, offers clients an advisory service which combines unlimited guidance provided by a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER and our robo-advice technology to make financial and investment planning more accessible to investors. Schwab Intelligent Income is a low-cost solution designed to offer a simple, modern way to generate income from existing investment portfolios. \u2122 \u00ae \u00ae \u2122 \u00ae\n\nClients of TD Ameritrade also have access to a suite of programs designed to meet their specific investment advisory needs. TDA's Selective Portfolios offers a broader range of goal-oriented portfolios made up of mutual funds and ETFs, through a combination of automated technology and professional insights. TDA's Personalized Portfolios offers clients tailored portfolios, supported by a team of investment professionals. Finally, TDA's AdvisorDirect referral program provides clients with an introduction to an independent RIA that can assist in developing customized investment strategies around their unique goals. \u00ae\n\nFurther, given our belief in the importance of financial planning, we offer a broad set of planning capabilities addressing a variety of planning needs. Our solutions include simple, free digital retirement calculators, our complimentary Digital Schwab Plan available to all Schwab clients, as well as more complex planning solutions that are delivered by a Schwab representative who takes into account a client's personal and financial goals to build a tailored financial plan. \u00ae\n\nTo meet the specific needs of clients who actively trade, Schwab offers integrated web- and software-based trading platforms, realtime market data, options trading, premium stock and futures research, and multi-channel access, as well as sophisticated account and trade management features, risk management and decision support tools, and dedicated personal support. For example, clients that trade more actively can use these channels to access highly competitive pricing, expert tools, and extensive service capabilities - including experienced, knowledgeable teams of trading specialists, and integrated product offerings. TD Ameritrade offers clients the robust thinkorswim trading platform designed for the specialized needs of active traders, the Trading Learning Center to help build client knowledge through sequenced courses, the TDA Network, in-house financial network programming, and a trading community platform allowing traders to share ideas. \u00ae\n\nFor U.S. clients wishing to invest in foreign equities, Schwab offers a suite of global investing capabilities, including online access to certain foreign equity markets with the ability to trade in their local currencies. In addition, Schwab serves both foreign investors and non-English-speaking U.S. clients who wish to trade or invest in U.S. dollar-based securities.\n\nWe also offer clients a range of self-service education and support tools, providing quick and efficient access to a broad lineup of information, research, tools, and administrative services, which clients can access according to their needs. Educational tools include workshops, webcasts, podcasts, interactive courses, and online information about investing, from which Schwab does not earn revenue. Since 2020, we've maintained virtual events to engage with retail and institutional clients amidst an unprecedented climate. Additionally, we provide various online research and analysis tools that are designed to help clients achieve better investment outcomes. As an example of analysis tools available to clients, Schwab Equity Ratings is a quantitative model-based stock rating system that provides all clients with ratings on approximately 3,000 stocks, assigning each equity a single grade: A, B, C, D, or F. Schwab Equity Ratings International , an international ranking methodology, covers stocks of approximately 4,000 foreign companies. Another example of expanding access to investing includes Schwab Stock Slices\u2122, a service which enables investors to purchase a single stock slice, or up to 10 different stock slices at once, from the S&amp;P 500 commission-free through our online channels. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nWe also offer equity compensation plan sponsors full-service recordkeeping for stock plans, stock options, restricted stock, performance shares, stock appreciation rights, and a full range of participant support services through our Stock Plan Services business unit. Specialized services for executive transactions and reporting, grant acceptance tracking, and other services are offered to employers to meet the needs of administering the reporting and compliance aspects of an equity compensation plan.\n\nOur Retirement Plan Services business unit offers a bundled 401(k) retirement plan product that provides retirement plan sponsors with extensive investment options, trustee or custodial services, and participant-level recordkeeping.
