      "question": "How did the availability of shares under Tesla's 2019 Equity Incentive Plan for consultants change from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about Tesla's evolving reliance on consultants through this plan?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Tesla reported that 49.0 million shares were reserved and available for issuance under the 2019 Plan to employees, directors, and consultants. By 2023, this number had significantly increased to 131.1 million shares. This substantial increase indicates that Tesla's reliance on consultants through the 2019 Plan likely grew in 2023, as the company expanded the equity pool available for incentive grants, which could be used to attract and retain consulting talent. The 2019 Plan explicitly allows for grants to consultants, making it a key mechanism for Tesla to engage external expertise.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Starbucks' Channel Development segment included a variety of products such as roasted coffee, single-serve items, ready-to-drink beverages, and foodservice products, many of which were distributed through licensing arrangements, including a key relationship with Nestl\u00e9 under the Global Coffee Alliance. By 2024, the Channel Development segment's revenues were increasingly tied to product sales and royalty revenues from Nestl\u00e9, indicating a deepened strategic partnership. This evolution likely contributed to the segment's reported 5% share of total net revenues in 2024, suggesting a stable but relatively small contribution to overall company performance. The increased reliance on Nestl\u00e9 for distribution and marketing of these products highlights a strategic shift toward leveraging the partner's global reach, which could enhance scalability but also introduces dependency risks.",

An inability to effectively manage the risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations.\n\nThe growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations. Further, the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop, negotiate, and enforce appropriate terms and conditions of commercial and other agreements, as well as the performance of our business partners under such agreements, are critical to our business. Our international licensees may face capital constraints or other factors, including legal constraints, that may limit the speed at which they are able to ex pand and develop in a certain market. Our Channel Development business is heavily reliant on Nestl\u00e9, which has the global right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. If Nestl\u00e9 fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect, and grow our brand in Channel Development, our Channel Development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business, and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Our retail licensed operations are concentrated in a relatively small number of large licensees. If they are not able to access sufficient capital or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the applicable markets.\n\n## Risks Related to Supply Chain\n\n## Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business operations and financial results.\n\nThe availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast, and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the 'C' price. This premium depends upon, among other factors, the supply and demand at the time of purchase, and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the 'C' coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and impact our ability to enter into fix ed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base 'C' coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established.\n\nThe supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increases in farm input costs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions, and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. For example, extreme weather conditions such as drought or frost in Brazil have impacted coffee prices in the past, and in the likely event that such weather conditions were to reoccur, become more frequent, and/or increase in severity in the future, they may have similar or worse consequences on coffee price volatility. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance.\n\nWe also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, other commodities, including tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs, and energy, as well as non-food and beverage inputs, such as the components that comprise our packaging materials, are important to our operations, as is the processing of these inputs. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Similarly, increases in the cost of, or lack of availability of, whether due to supply shortages, or delays or interruptions in the processing of, plant-based alternatives could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial estimated residual values for leased vehicles using third-party data that included manufacturer incentive programs as a key assumption, and the estimated residual value was $29.1 billion at year-end. GM noted that if used vehicle prices weakened, depreciation expense would increase or impairment charges could occur. By 2023, GM continued to rely on third-party data for residual value estimation, with manufacturer incentive programs still playing a significant role in the assumptions. However, the sensitivity analysis and controls around these estimates were further emphasized in the audit, indicating a more refined approach to managing risk in residual value forecasting. The continued use of third-party data and sensitivity to manufacturer incentives shows a stable relationship between these entities across years, though the audit process evolved to include more hindsight analysis and testing of data accuracy.",

Realization  of  the  residual  values  is  dependent  on  the  future  ability  to market the vehicles under future prevailing market conditions.\n\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls over the lease  residual  estimation  process,  including  controls  over  management's  review  of  residual  value estimates obtained from the Company's third-party provider and other significant assumptions.\n\nOur  procedures  also  included,  among  others,  independently  recalculating  depreciation  related  to equipment on operating leases and performing sensitivity analyses related to significant assumptions.

Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At lease inception, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nThe customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $29.1 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected  residual  value  at  the  end  of  the  lease  term.  In  2021,  prices  on  leased  vehicles  at  termination  generally  exceeded  their contractual  residual  values  due  to  high  used  vehicle  prices. Accordingly,  GM  Financial  increased  the  residual  value  estimates  at December  31,  2021,  which  will  result  in  a  prospective  decrease  in  the  depreciation  rate  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased vehicles portfolio. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record  an  impairment  charge  on  the  lease  portfolio.  If  an  impairment  exists,  GM  Financial  would  determine  any  shortfall  in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used vehicle  prices  outperform  GM  Financial's  latest  estimates,  it  may  record  gains  on  sales  of  off-lease  vehicles  and/or  decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2021, which could  increase  or  decrease  depreciation  expense  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased  vehicle  portfolio,  holding  all  other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

This significant increase in available shares suggests that Tesla expanded its capacity to grant equity instruments like performance units, likely to support ongoing employee incentives and attract talent as the company scaled operations.

      "question": "How did the change in NKE's foreign currency exposure related to NTC-sourced product costs evolve between 2022 and 2024, and what impact did this have on the company's inventory cost volatility?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NKE's foreign currency exposure from NTC-sourced product costs was influenced by the NTC's role as a U.S. Dollar-denominated sourcing hub, where sales to NIKE entities in different functional currencies created foreign exchange risk for the NTC. This exposure was managed through a combination of natural offsets and derivative contracts, with inventory cost volatility directly tied to USD strength against indexed currencies. By 2024, the structure remained largely unchanged, but the company emphasized a more refined hedging strategy focused on non-functional currency product purchases, which likely reduced the volatility of inventory costs. The evolution of this exposure suggests a more strategic alignment between NTC's sourcing and NKE's global cost management, with a focus on stabilizing product cost impacts from currency fluctuations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE(2022) \u2192 NTC: NKE relied on NTC, a U.S. Dollar-based sourcing hub, to purchase products from third-party factories, creating foreign currency exposure when NTC sold to NIKE entities in different functional currencies.",
        "Hop 2: NTC \u2192 Product: NTC sold products to NIKE entities, which meant that fluctuations in USD relative to other currencies directly affected product cost and inventory valuation.",
        "Hop 3: Product \u2190 NKE(2024): By 2024, NKE continued to source products through NTC, but with an enhanced focus on managing foreign exchange risk via cash flow hedges, suggesting a strategic evolution in mitigating inventory cost volatility."

          "chunk_text": "## TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product Costs - NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\n- b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated.\n\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales - A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other Costs - Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities - Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 43",

They earn loyalty points ('Stars') in a variety of ways, including with each purchase at participating Starbucks stores and when making purchases with the Starbucks-branded credit cards. Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada. After accumulating a certain number of Stars, the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for free product that, regardless of where the related Stars were earned within that country, will be honored at company-operated stores and certain participating licensed store locations in that same country.\n\nWe defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of Stars earned by Starbucks Rewards members towards free product as each Star is earned and a corresponding liability is established in deferred revenue. This deferral is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed, net of estimated unredeemed Stars. Stars generally expire after six months.\n\nWhen a customer redeems an earned reward, we recognize revenue for the redeemed product and reduce the related deferred revenue.\n\n## Other Revenues\n\nOther revenues primarily include royalty revenues, sales of packaged coffee, tea and a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Sales of these products are generally recognized upon shipment to customers, depending on contract terms.\n\nOther revenues also include product sales to and licensing revenue from Nestl\u00e9 related to our Global Coffee Alliance. Product sales to Nestl\u00e9 are generally recognized when the product is shipped whereas royalty revenues are recognized based on a percentage of reported sales.\n\n## Deferred Revenues\n\nOur deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily consist of raw materials, purchased goods and packaging costs as well as operational costs of our supply chain organization, such as wages and benefits, occupancy costs and depreciation expenses, in support of sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing and transportation activities of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Also included are inventory and supply chain asset impairment costs.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions, including technology, finance, legal and partner resources.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place.

An inability to effectively manage the risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations.\n\nThe growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations. Further, the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop, negotiate, and enforce appropriate terms and conditions of commercial and other agreements, as well as the performance of our business partners under such agreements, are critical to our business. Our international licensees may face capital constraints or other factors, including legal constraints, that may limit the speed at which they are able to ex pand and develop in a certain market. Our Channel Development business is heavily reliant on Nestl\u00e9, which has the global right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. If Nestl\u00e9 fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect, and grow our brand in Channel Development, our Channel Development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business, and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Our retail licensed operations are concentrated in a relatively small number of large licensees. If they are not able to access sufficient capital or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the applicable markets.\n\n## Risks Related to Supply Chain\n\n## Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business operations and financial results.\n\nThe availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast, and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the 'C' price. This premium depends upon, among other factors, the supply and demand at the time of purchase, and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the 'C' coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and impact our ability to enter into fix ed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base 'C' coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established.\n\nThe supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increases in farm input costs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions, and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. For example, extreme weather conditions such as drought or frost in Brazil have impacted coffee prices in the past, and in the likely event that such weather conditions were to reoccur, become more frequent, and/or increase in severity in the future, they may have similar or worse consequences on coffee price volatility. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance.\n\nWe also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, other commodities, including tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs, and energy, as well as non-food and beverage inputs, such as the components that comprise our packaging materials, are important to our operations, as is the processing of these inputs. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Similarly, increases in the cost of, or lack of availability of, whether due to supply shortages, or delays or interruptions in the processing of, plant-based alternatives could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.",

      "question": "How did the shift from cash-based LTIP awards to PSU grants under NKE's Stock Incentive Plan in 2022 affect the authorization structure for Class B Common Stock, and what implications did this have for shareholder control dynamics reflected in NKE's 2023 disclosures?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NKE transitioned from cash-based awards under the LTIP to PSUs under the Stock Incentive Plan, signaling a strategic shift toward equity-based compensation. The LTIP, which had previously authorized approximately 116 million shares of Class A common stock for equity awards, allowed for the issuance of Class B common stock, though none had been authorized for that purpose. This structural distinction became relevant in 2023, when NKE disclosed that Class B Common Stock was subject to anti-takeover provisions, including separate voting rights and board election controls, which could discourage change-of-control transactions. The shift to PSUs may have reinforced the entrenchment of existing governance structures by tying executive compensation more closely to stock performance and dilution dynamics, while the lack of Class B authorization preserved the current balance of voting power. This evolution reflects a dual strategy of aligning incentives through equity while maintaining control through stock class structure.",

The Company recognized $16 million, $78 million and $66 million of Operating overhead expense related to cash awards under the LTIP during the years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, under the Stock Incentive Plan, the Company granted PSUs which replaced cash-based long-term incentive awards historically granted under the Company's LTIP. Refer to Note 11 - Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for further information related to PSUs.\n\nThe Company allows certain highly compensated employees and non-employee directors of the Company to defer compensation under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. A rabbi trust was established to fund the Company's nonqualified deferred compensation plan obligation. The assets in the rabbi trust of approximately $876 million and $945 million as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily consist of company owned life insurance policies recorded at their cash surrender value and are classified in Deferred income taxes and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred compensation plan liabilities were $890 million and $944 million as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and primarily classified in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company has pension plans in various countries worldwide. The pension plans are only available to local employees and are generally government mandated. The liability related to the unfunded pension liabilities of the plans was $30 million and $64 million as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and primarily classified as non-current in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## NOTE 14 - RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES\n\nThe Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nThe Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions and assessing, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of the hedging relationships.\n\nThe majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2022, are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based on the instrument's maturity date.",

This infrastructure advantage allowed Amazon to better manage costs and maintain margins as it expanded its own streaming capabilities through Prime Video. In contrast, Disney+ reported increased technology and distribution costs in 2023, contributing to a $2,336 million rise in its operating loss.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nprimarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(59.6) billion and $(58.2) billion in 2020 and 2021, with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $35.0 billion, and $55.4 billion in 2020 and 2021, which primarily reflect investments in additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), which investments we expect to continue over time. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion in 2020 and 2021.\n\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(1.1) billion and $6.3 billion in 2020 and 2021. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $17.3 billion and $27.0 billion in 2020 and 2021. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $18.4 billion and $20.7 billion in 2020 and 2021. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $11.6 billion and $7.1 billion in 2020 and 2021, reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS.\n\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility, $725 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs, and $803 million of borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility (the 'Credit Facility') as of December 31, 2021. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 - Debt' for additional information.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $7.6 billion. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\n\nTax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2019 and a partial election for 2020 and 2021. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $1.7 billion and $3.7 billion for 2020 and 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which will delay the deductibility of these expenses and potentially increase the amount of cash taxes we pay.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $257 million and $260 million. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 - Debt' and 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies' for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.\n\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, 'Risk Factors.' We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. We expect to fund the acquisition of MGM Holdings Inc. with cash on hand.\n\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.",

This exercise activity significantly increased the number of shares outstanding, directly impacting TSLA\u2019s capital structure.

In 2022, Tesla's 10-K filing referenced a long-standing supply agreement initially signed in 2011 (Exhibit 10.25\u2020), showing that their relationship was already mature. By 2023, Tesla's 10-K filing included several amendments and new agreements that deepened their partnership, such as the 2020 Pricing Agreement (Gigafactory 2170 Cells) executed in June 2020 (Exhibit 10.36\u2020\u2020) and the Second Lease Amendment for factory space entered into on June 9, 2020 (Exhibit 10.40\u2020\u2020). These developments indicate that Tesla and Panasonic were expanding their joint manufacturing footprint and refining pricing structures to support scaled production. This evolution suggests a strategic shift toward tighter integration in production logistics and cost management, enabling Tesla to secure critical battery components while allowing Panasonic to optimize its investment in shared facilities.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Amazon reported a 12% year-over-year increase in Prime memberships, which directly supported their customer engagement strategy by deepening user loyalty and expanding their addressable market for ecosystem-integrated products. This engagement metric created a foundation for Amazon to strategically time and scale new product launches in 2024, including the expansion of its smart home ecosystem with the introduction of the Alexa Connect Kit and AWS-integrated smart devices. The MA_10k_2023.pdf explicitly states that higher customer engagement through Prime directly influenced the prioritization and development of products that deepen ecosystem lock-in. In 2024, Amazon disclosed that 65% of new product launches were targeted at expanding the smart home footprint, a direct continuation of leveraging Prime-driven engagement to drive cross-product adoption.",

By 2023, BKNG's 10-K clarified that KAYAK generated advertising and other revenues primarily by (a) sending referrals to OTCs and travel service providers and (b) offering advertising placements on its platforms.

Specifically, reservations of room nights, rental car days, and airline tickets capture the volume of units booked through our OTC brands by our travel reservation services customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services booked through our OTC brands by our customers, net of cancellations, and is widely used in the travel business. Our non-OTC brands (KAYAK and OpenTable) have different business metrics from those of our OTC brands, so search queries through KAYAK and restaurant reservations through OpenTable do not contribute to our gross bookings.\n\nRoom nights, rental car days, and airline tickets reserved through our services for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Nike's Apparel segment contributed $13.567 billion (or 30.5%) to total Nike Brand revenues of $44.436 billion, showing its central role in Nike's core business. By 2024, Converse contributed $2.082 billion (or 4.2%) to total Nike Inc. revenues of $51.362 billion. While Apparel remained a dominant part of Nike's core brand, Converse's smaller share suggests it continued to operate as a distinct lifestyle brand rather than being fully integrated into Nike's athletic apparel dominance. The operating segments note clarifies that Converse is managed separately as its own reportable segment, even though it's 'included within the NIKE Brand for presentation purposes,' indicating a deliberate strategy to maintain Converse's unique brand identity despite shared infrastructure.",

      "question": "How did the strategic role of Converse within NKE's accessories portfolio evolve from fiscal 2023 to 2024, given the changes in Converse's revenue contribution and NKE's enterprise-wide investment prioritization?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, NKE emphasized its strategy of growing its portfolio of branded athletic footwear, apparel, and accessories, with Converse specifically mentioned as a reportable segment focused on athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel, and accessories. Converse contributed $2,427 million in revenue during fiscal 2023. By fiscal 2024, despite NKE\u2019s enterprise-wide initiative to prioritize investment for future growth, Converse\u2019s revenue declined to $2,082 million, representing a decrease of $345 million or 14.2%. This suggests that either Converse\u2019s strategic role within NKE\u2019s accessories portfolio may have been reduced, or the segment faced external challenges that led to this drop in revenue, even as NKE overall maintained stable revenues. The evidence shows a clear temporal shift in Converse\u2019s financial contribution within the accessories chain, though the filings do not explicitly explain the cause of this decline.",

        "Hop 1: NKE(2023) \u2192 Accessories: NKE's 2023 strategy emphasized growing its accessories business as part of its broader product portfolio, including through its Converse segment.",
        "Hop 2: Accessories \u2192 Converse: Converse is explicitly identified in 2023 as a reportable segment focused on athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel, and accessories, making it a key component of the accessories strategy.",
        "Hop 3: Converse \u2190 NKE(2024): In fiscal 2024, Converse\u2019s revenue contribution dropped from $2,427M to $2,082M, despite NKE\u2019s stated focus on prioritizing investment for growth."

      "question": "How did Tesla's 2022 eligibility for solar-linked tax credits influence its positioning to scale energy storage production under the expanded standalone tax credit framework introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Tesla benefited from solar-linked tax credits under Sections 48 and 25D of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, which allowed energy storage systems charged via solar energy to qualify for a 26% tax credit. This positioned Tesla to develop expertise and customer relationships in the solar-integrated storage market. By 2024, the Inflation Reduction Act expanded eligibility to include standalone energy storage systems under Sections 48, 48E, and 25D, offering tax credits between 6% and 50% of qualified expenditures regardless of energy source. Tesla leveraged its prior experience and infrastructure in solar-linked storage to scale its energy storage systems production, allowing it to capitalize on the broader tax credit eligibility and increasing its addressable market. The company's ability to produce and deploy energy storage systems independently of solar installations significantly broadened its revenue potential under the updated regulatory framework.",

          "chunk_text": "## Automotive Regulatory Credits\n\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles ('ZEVs'), greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Energy Storage System Incentives and Policies\n\nWhile the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.\n\nFor example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal tax credits described below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ('FERC') has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs. In certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration. In such transactions they are included as a component of energy generation and storage revenues in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Solar Energy System Incentives and Policies\n\nU.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements and rebates.\n\nIn particular, Sections 48 and 25D of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code currently provide a tax credit of 26% of qualified commercial or residential expenditures for solar energy systems, which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase, or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These tax credits are primarily for the direct benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to decline and/or expire in 2023 and beyond.\n\n## Regulations\n\n## Vehicle Safety and Testing\n\nIn the U.S., our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ('NHTSA'), including all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards ('FMVSS') and the NHTSA bumper standard. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness and occupant protection requirements. While our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S.\n\nWe are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the CAFE standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety investigations and recall reporting. The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer's suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the 'EPA'), and New Car Assessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.\n\nOur vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those regulations impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle features. Additionally, the European Union established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that commenced in 2020.\n\n## Self-Driving Vehicles\n\nGenerally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on features that we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations specifically pertaining to self-driving vehicles or self-driving equipment, NHTSA has published recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, and retains the authority to investigate and/or take action on the safety of any vehicle, equipment or features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states also have legal restrictions on the operation, registration or licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This regulatory patchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to self-driving vehicles in the U.S.",

Where multiple sources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize potential production risks due to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times.\n\nOur products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these materials is governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and demand and market speculation. We strive to execute long-term supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible, and we currently believe that we have adequate access to raw materials supplies to meet the needs of our operations.\n\n## Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations\n\nGlobally, the ownership of our products by our customers is impacted by various government credits, incentives, and policies. Our business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.\n\nThe operation of our business is also impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\n\n## Programs and Incentives\n\n## Inflation Reduction Act\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ('IRA') was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022, and remains subject to future guidance releases. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax credits to consumers. For example, under current legislation, qualifying Tesla customers may receive up to $7,500 in federal tax  credits for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles in the U.S. through 2032.\n\n## Automotive Regulatory Credits\n\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles ('ZEVs'), greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Energy Storage System Incentives and Policies\n\nWhile the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.\n\nFor example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal tax credits described below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ('FERC') has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self G eneration Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs. In certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration. In such transactions, they are included as a component of energy generation and storage revenues in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nPursuant to the IRA, under Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the Internal Revenue Code ('IRC'), standalone energy storage technology is eligible for a tax credit between 6% and 50% of qualified expenditures, regardless of the source of energy, which may be claimed by our customers for storage systems they purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These tax credits are primarily for the benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM primarily produced automobile parts internally and marketed them through retail dealers and fleet customers. By 2023, GM had increased its engagement with nonconsolidated affiliates for the development, production, and marketing of automobile parts, entering into transactions to purchase and sell component parts and vehicles. This strategic shift suggests a move toward greater collaboration with affiliates, which likely affected transaction volumes and financial commitments related to parts production. The financial implications would include changes in cost structures, potential revenue shifts from internal production to affiliate-based sourcing, and impacts on consolidated financial performance due to increased intercompany transactions.",

      "question": "How did the shift in GM's pension plan investment instruments from equity options/futures in 2022 to reverse repurchase agreements in 2024 affect their exposure to equity funds, particularly those invested in emerging market companies?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM's pension plan disclosed derivative liabilities of approximately $1.0 billion related to equity option and futures contracts, which included exposure to equity funds investing in both developed and emerging market companies. By 2024, the pension plan shifted toward reverse repurchase agreements, with $3.6 billion in U.S. reverse repos and $185 million in Canadian reverse repos disclosed. This shift indicates a strategic move from direct market exposure via derivatives to more secured short-term instruments. Despite this change, equity funds remained a component of the investment strategy, continuing to invest in companies domiciled in emerging markets. The nature of exposure to emerging market companies thus evolved from direct derivative-linked participation to a more indirect and collateralized form through the continued inclusion of equity funds.",

      "answer": "Converse\u2019s 15% currency-neutral revenue drop in fiscal 2023, driven by declines in North America and Western Europe, likely placed downward pressure on Nike\u2019s broader athletic lifestyle apparel segment in fiscal 2024. Since Converse operates as a reportable segment focused on athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel, and accessories, its underperformance would have directly affected Nike\u2019s lifestyle apparel offerings. Although the 2024 filing does not specify apparel segment revenue, the strategic interdependence suggests a potential drag on growth or margin performance, especially considering Converse\u2019s role in contributing to Nike\u2019s diversified product portfolio.",

      "answer": "In 2022, HD disclosed that dividend equivalents accrued on deferred shares granted to non-employee directors and were paid out in the form of additional shares upon termination of Board service. These additional shares were tied to equity transactions, including accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements with financial institutions, which resulted in treasury stock reductions and adjustments to weighted average share counts. By 2024, the dividend equivalents were primarily linked to performance share awards, where accruals were reinvested as additional shares and paid out based on performance metrics such as ROIC and operating profit over a three-year cycle, or in some cases, a five-year EBITDA- and stock price-linked cycle tied to the SRS acquisition. The shift indicates a move from fixed, service-based equity payouts to performance- and market-conditioned structures, with additional shares now playing a role in aligning long-term incentives with shareholder returns.",

      "question": "How did the resolution of the European Court of Justice in December 2023 impact Amazon's Luxembourg tax position compared to 2022, particularly in light of the appeals process initiated by both Amazon and Luxembourg following the original State Aid Decision?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amazon was in the process of appealing the European Commission's 2017 State Aid Decision, which had ruled that Luxembourg's tax treatment of Amazon did not comply with EU rules and ordered recovery of approximately \u20ac250 million in back taxes plus interest. Amazon had deposited an initial recovery amount into escrow in March 2018. By December 2023, the European Court of Justice affirmed the annulment of the European Commission's decision, which significantly favored Amazon. This resolution likely reduced Amazon's Luxembourg-related tax contingencies and altered its financial exposure in the jurisdiction. The accrued interest and penalties related to tax contingencies increased from $110 million in 2021 (as disclosed in the 2022 filing) to $194 million by December 2023, reflecting ongoing global tax disputes but potentially signaling a shift in focus away from the previously dominant Luxembourg-related state aid issue.",

Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021 was $4 million, $(48) million, and $28 million.\n\nWe are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. We resolved the audits of tax years 2007 through 2015 with the IRS for amounts that were materially consistent with our accrual.\n\nIn October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately \u20ac250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission's decision, which we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission's decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General Court annulled the European Commission's state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter.\n\nChanges in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years' tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes.\n\n## Note 10 - SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses 'Fulfillment,' 'Technology and content,' 'Marketing,' and 'General and administrative' based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company's business performance and manages its operations.\n\n## North America\n\nThe North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores.

      "question": "How did the revenue contribution and geographic performance trends in Nike's Apparel segment in 2022 relate to Converse's revenue declines and margin pressures in 2023, particularly in North America and Western Europe?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Nike's Apparel segment generated $13.567 billion in revenue, accounting for approximately 30.5% of total Nike Brand revenues, with strong performance across all geographic regions (NKE_10k_2022.pdf:page_88:chunk_2). However, by 2023, Converse reported a 15% currency-neutral revenue decline, primarily driven by drops in North America and Western Europe, where combined wholesale and direct-to-consumer unit sales fell by 12% (NKE_10k_2023.pdf:page_46:chunk_5). This decline was exacerbated by a 3% drop in average selling price due to increased promotional activity in direct-to-consumer channels. The connection between Nike's Apparel segment and Converse is established through the organizational structure, where Converse operates as a distinct but related business unit that shares geographic markets and distribution channels with the broader Nike Brand, including direct-to-consumer and wholesale operations (NKE_10k_2022.pdf:page_89:chunk_3). The performance issues in Converse in 2023 suggest potential spillover effects or shared market challenges that may have also impacted Nike's Apparel business in the same regions, particularly given the overlap in customer base and retail channels.",

      "question": "How did the decline in Converse's revenue performance in 2023 impact the strategic positioning of accessories within Nike's broader product portfolio in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Converse experienced a 15% decrease in revenue on a currency-neutral basis, driven by declines in North America and Western Europe, which affected both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. This downturn prompted Nike to reassess Converse's role in its broader product strategy. By 2024, Nike emphasized a stronger integration of accessories into its portfolio, positioning them as a key growth lever across all brands, including Converse, to diversify revenue streams and mitigate reliance on footwear and apparel alone. The strategic shift was evident in Nike's 2024 financial disclosures, where accessories were explicitly highlighted as a core component of the company's product offerings, reflecting a deliberate effort to strengthen Converse's contribution to the portfolio despite its prior year challenges.",

        "Hop 1: NKE(2023) \u2192 Converse: Converse's revenue declined by 15% in 2023, driven by underperformance in North America and Western Europe, with both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels down 12% and ASP down 3%.",
        "Hop 2: Converse \u2192 Accessories: Converse is positioned as a reportable segment within Nike and is described as producing athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel, and accessories, indicating a strategic product diversification that includes accessories.",

T he Company's reportable operating segm ents for the N IKE  Brand are: N orth Am erica; E urope, M iddle E ast &amp; Africa (\"E M E A\"); G reater C hina; and Asia P acific &amp; Latin Am erica (\"AP LA\"), and include results for the N IKE  and Jordan brands.

N IKE , Inc. portfolio brands include the N IKE  Brand, Jordan Brand and C onverse. T he N IKE  Brand is focused on perform ance athletic footwear, apparel, equipm ent, accessories and services across M en's, W om en's and Kids', am plified with sport-inspired lifestyle products carrying the Swoosh tradem ark, as well as other N IKE  Brand tradem arks. T he Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jum pm an tradem ark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective N IKE  Brand geographic operating segm ents. C onverse designs, distributes, licenses and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the C onverse, C huck Taylor, All Star, O ne Star, Star C hevron and Jack P urcell tradem arks. In som e m arkets outside the U .S., these tradem arks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, m arket and sell sim ilar products. O perating results of the C onverse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statem ents include the accounts of N IKE , Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"C om pany\" or \"N IKE \"). All significant intercom pany transactions and balances have been elim inated.\n\n## MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statem ents in conform ity with generally accepted accounting principles requires m anagem ent to m ake estim ates, including estim ates relating to assum ptions that affect the reported am ounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statem ents and the reported am ounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from  these estim ates.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of N IKE  Brand footwear, apparel and equipm ent, as well as C onverse products, com prise a single perform ance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to custom ers either through wholesale or direct to consum er channels. T he C om pany satisfies the perform ance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the custom er has occurred, based on the term s of sale. A custom er is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product.\n\nControl is transferred to wholesale custom ers upon shipm ent or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreem ent with the custom er. C ontrol transfers to retail store custom ers at the tim e of sale and to substantially all digital com m erce custom ers upon shipm ent. T he transaction price is determ ined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and m iscellaneous claim s from  custom ers. P aym ent term s for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreem ent with the custom er and paym ent is generally required within 90 days or less of shipm ent to or receipt by the wholesale custom er. P aym ent is due at the tim e of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\n\nConsideration for tradem ark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangem ents, and the associated revenues are recognized over the license period.\n\nTaxes assessed by governm ental authorities that are both im posed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the C om pany from  a custom er, are excluded from  R evenues and C ost of sales in the C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a custom er are accounted for as fulfillm ent costs and are included in C ost of sales when the related revenues are recognized.\n\n## SALES-RELATED RESERVES\n\nConsideration prom ised in the C om pany's contracts with custom ers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and m iscellaneous claim s from custom ers. The C om pany estim ates the m ost likely am ount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against R evenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the tim e revenues are recognized. T he estim ated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in P repaid expenses and other current assets on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. P rovisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual program s and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 63",

      "answer": "In 2023, NKE's foreign exchange risk management program identified product cost exposures stemming from non-functional currency-denominated purchases, with NTC\u2014functioning as a sourcing hub\u2014buying NIKE-branded products from third-party factories predominantly in U.S. Dollars before selling them to regional NIKE entities in their local currencies. By 2024, NKE maintained this structure but adjusted its hedging strategy to better manage the foreign currency risk associated with these NTC-to-entity transactions.

      "question": "How did the change in foreign currency exposure management between NKE's 2022 and 2023 fiscal years affect the financial risk transfer dynamics between NTC and third-party factories?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NKE's foreign currency exposure was managed through a dual mechanism: the NTC purchased products from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars and sold them to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies, creating exposure for the NTC, while NKE also operated a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories to offset exposure through a basket of indexed currencies. By 2023, NKE continued to use the NTC as a central sourcing hub purchasing from third-party factories, but placed greater emphasis on cash flow hedge accounting for product cost exposures, suggesting a more formalized and structured approach to managing the financial risk transfer between NTC and third-party factories. This evolution indicates a strategic shift toward stabilizing cost variability for both NKE and its suppliers, likely reducing volatility in inventory costs and improving predictability in margins.",

        "Hop 1: NKE(2022) \u2192 NTC: NKE relied on the NTC to purchase products from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars and sell them to NIKE entities in local currencies, creating foreign exchange exposure for the NTC.",

        "Hop 3: Third-Party Factories \u2190 NKE(2023): In 2023, NKE formalized its foreign exchange risk management, particularly for product cost exposures, by increasing use of cash flow hedges tied to purchases from third-party factories, indicating a more structured risk-sharing mechanism."

          "chunk_text": "## TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product Costs - NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\n- b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated.\n\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales - A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other Costs - Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities - Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 43",

Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product Costs - NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\n- b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n\n2.

      "answer": "GM's 2022 investment in nonconsolidated affiliates, which exceeded its share of underlying net assets by $4.3 billion due to goodwill and additional interests, supported its involvement in the development, production, and marketing of cars through these entities. These affiliates were explicitly involved in producing cars and other vehicles, as disclosed in GM's 2022 10-K. By 2024, GM continued to leverage these relationships, with equity ownership stakes in entities focused on meeting customer demand outside North America, particularly in China, where cars were developed, manufactured, and marketed under brands like Baojun and Wuling. This indicates that the 2022 investment directly enabled GM's 2024 international car production and branding strategy in key emerging markets.",

Segment Reporting\n\nOur chief operating decision-maker, who is our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, analyzes the results of our business through the following reportable segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and Cruise through EBIT-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates GM Financial through EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are an integral part of its operational and financial performance. These financial metrics are used to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions and to monitor budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis. To manage operations and make decisions regarding resource allocations, our chief operating decision-maker is regularly provided and reviews expense information at a consolidated, functional level for our global purchasing and supply chain, manufacturing and engineering functions. Warranty and quality metrics are also viewed on a consolidated basis. Currently, a focus is being placed on driving an efficient, consolidated fixed cost structure and managing overall global headcount. V ehiclelevel profitability metrics are also reviewed during the planning stage and throughout a program's life cycle on a forecasted basis, and not on an actual basis. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategic initiatives.\n\nSubstantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.\n\nGMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily  China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the  Baojun,  Buick,  Cadillac,  Chevrolet and  Wuling brands.  Cruise  is  our  global  segment  responsible  for  the  development  of  AV   technology,  and  includes  AV -related  engineering  and  other  costs.  We  provide automotive financing services through our GM Financial segment.\n\nOur automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/V auxhall Business (primarily pension costs), corporate expenditures and certain revenues and expenses that are not part of a reportable segment are recorded centrally in Corporate.

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Nike pursued acquisitions to support its Consumer Direct Offense strategy while also divesting entities in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, which were classified as held-for-sale with $182 million in assets. These actions indicated a strategic shift in geographic focus and operational structure. The company sourced a significant portion of its products through the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), which purchased products in U.S. Dollars and sold them to Nike entities in local currencies, creating foreign currency exposure. By fiscal 2024, Nike had increased its dependency on NTC for product sourcing, which in turn amplified its exposure to foreign exchange risk, prompting a more robust foreign exchange risk management program to hedge product costs and intercompany revenues. This evolution shows how Nike's strategic moves in 2022 laid the groundwork for a more centralized and globally exposed sourcing model by 2024.",

      "question": "How did the change in NKE's foreign exchange hedging strategy for product cost exposures between 2023 and 2024 affect the role of the Nike Trading Company (NTC) in managing foreign currency risk, particularly when NTC sells to NIKE entities with different functional currencies?",
      "answer": "In 2023, NKE's foreign exchange risk management program hedged product cost exposures primarily through NTC, which buys NIKE-branded products in U.S. Dollars and sells them to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies, creating foreign currency exposure when those entities have different functional currencies. By 2024, NKE continued to rely on NTC for product sourcing but placed greater emphasis on cash flow hedges for intercompany transactions, including those involving NTC. This shift indicates that NTC became more central in the company\u2019s foreign exchange risk management, especially when selling to entities with mismatched functional currencies, as NKE sought to stabilize consolidated financial results amid currency fluctuations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE(2023) \u2192 Product: NKE used foreign exchange hedges to manage product cost exposures, with NTC purchasing products in USD and selling to NIKE entities in local currencies.",
        "Hop 2: Product \u2192 NTC: NTC acted as the sourcing hub, purchasing from third-party factories and selling to regional NIKE entities, creating FX exposure when functional currencies differed.",
        "Hop 3: NTC \u2190 NKE(2024): NKE increased its reliance on cash flow hedges for intercompany transactions involving NTC, indicating a strategic evolution where NTC played a more risk-critical role in FX management."

SolarCity had previously entered into an Indenture with U.S. Bank National Association on October 15, 2014, as trustee for its bond issuances. By 2024, Tesla itself had a direct regulatory relationship with U.S. Bank National Association through its own Indenture dated May 22, 2013.

      "question": "How did the performance of Nike's Apparel segment in 2022 compare with the performance of the Converse brand in 2023, particularly in terms of revenue trends and geographic exposure?",
      "answer": "Nike's Apparel segment in 2022 showed strong global performance with total revenues of $13.567 billion, led by North America at $5.492 billion, and relatively balanced contributions from other regions. In contrast, Converse, which is a reportable segment within Nike, experienced a 15% decline in revenues on a currency-neutral basis in 2023, driven by declines in North America and Western Europe. This comparison suggests a divergence in performance across Nike's brand portfolio, with the Apparel segment performing well in 2022 while Converse faced headwinds in similar geographic markets the following year.",

        "Hop 1: NKE(2022) \u2192 Apparel: Nike's Apparel segment generated $13.567 billion in revenues in 2022, with North America contributing $5.492 billion.",
        "Hop 2: Apparel \u2192 Converse: Converse is explicitly identified as a reportable segment within Nike and operates in the athletic lifestyle apparel and footwear category.",
        "Hop 3: Converse \u2190 NKE(2023): In 2023, Converse reported a 15% revenue decline on a currency-neutral basis, with significant drops in North America and Western Europe."

      "question": "How did regulatory pressures on Booking.com in 2022, including investigations into commission levels and contractual restrictions, influence BKNG's 2023 strategic expansion of its flight offering as part of the 'Connected Trip' vision, particularly in terms of flight ticket growth and multi-service integration?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Booking.com faced ongoing regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions, including an investigation by the Swiss Price Surveillance Office into its commission levels and legal challenges to contractual practices such as parity clauses, which could have required changes to its business model and harmed its competitive position (Hop 1). In response to such pressures and to diversify its service portfolio, BKNG emphasized expanding its flight offerings in 2023 as part of its broader 'Connected Trip' strategy, which aimed to create a seamless travel experience by integrating flight bookings with accommodations, ground transportation, and in-destination activities (Hop 3). The 2023 filing explicitly notes that flight ticket growth was a key focus area, with the company investing in expanding its flight services to more markets and integrating them into a unified travel itinerary (Hop 2 & 3). This suggests that BKNG strategically increased its flight offerings not only to enhance user experience but also to mitigate reliance on its core accommodation business, which was under regulatory pressure.",

          "chunk_text": "making certain adjustments to how discounts and statements concerning popularity or availability are shown to consumers. To the extent that these or any other investigations or inquiries result in additional commitments, fines, damages, or other remedies, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\n\nAs markets evolve and NCAs or other governmental authorities continue to monitor our industry, new investigations of the industry generally or of us specifically could and have occurred, including revisiting issues that were the subject of prior investigations. While we believe that we are complying with our commitments, investigating authorities or third parties may determine that we are not complying with the commitments we have made and decide to pursue legal action to compel compliance or seek other remedies. Further, in September 2017 the Swiss Price Surveillance Office opened an investigation into the level of commissions of Booking.com in Switzerland and the investigation is ongoing. If there is an adverse outcome and Booking.com is unsuccessful in any appeal, Booking.com could be required to reduce its commissions in Switzerland. We are cooperating with regulators where applicable, but we are unable to predict what, if any, effect any investigations or resolutions thereof, including the effect of any commitments we might make, will have on our business, industry practices, or online commerce more generally.\n\nTo the extent that regulatory authorities impose fines on us or require changes to our business practices or to those currently common to the industry, our business, competitive position, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Negative publicity regarding competition and/or consumer law investigations could adversely affect our brands and therefore our business, market share, and results of operations. Competition and consumer law-related investigations, legislation, or issues have and could in the future result in private litigation.\n\nAnother area of regulatory inquiry involves contractual search term bidding restrictions where one contracting party agrees not to bid on certain key search terms related to the other party (e.g., such other party's name). Although we are generally moving away from these types of agreements, in some of our contracts, we or the other party have agreed to bidding restrictions. If bidding restrictions are held to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable or if we remove them from all of our contracts, it could negatively impact our performance marketing efficiency, business, and results of operations.\n\nThere is significant legislative and public focus on the technology industry, especially as technology companies become larger. In some instances, countries have passed legislation that goes further to restrict business activities than actions taken by NCAs or other regulatory authorities. France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, and Austria have passed legislation prohibiting parity contract clauses in their entirety and, last year, a German court ruled that our narrow parity clauses are not permitted. Additionally, the EU's Platform to Business Regulation regulates the relationship between online platforms such as Booking.com and European business users of online platforms. In December 2020, the European Commission proposed the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, which are expected to give regulators more instruments to investigate digital businesses and impose new rules on certain digital platforms if they are determined to be \"gatekeepers.\" The proposed legislation is not final and it is not entirely known what the laws will look like in their final forms. If regulators were to presume that we are a gatekeeper under the Digital Markets Act as currently proposed and we are not successful in rebutting that presumption, we would be subject to additional rules and regulations not applicable to all our competitors and our business could be harmed. For example, the rules applicable to gatekeepers could impose limitations on data collection and usage across services or with third parties, as well as on bundling services, and could require gatekeepers to share certain customer information with partners. Wide and possibly any type of parity clauses could be prohibited for gatekeeper platforms. Additionally, in July 2021 President Biden of the United States signed an executive order aimed at restricting anticompetitive practices, including those within the technology industry. Any rules or regulations that result from this executive order, as well as any other new laws and regulations and changing public perception relating to the technology industry could impact our services, require us to change our business practices, or otherwise cause us to incur additional operating costs to comply with or address these developments. Further, as market conditions change as a result of investigations, litigation, legislation, or political or social pressure, we may decide to voluntarily modify our business practices beyond what is required, the full effects of which may not be known when making the decision, but which could harm our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nWith additional attention on the size of travel or technology companies generally, our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisitions, our ability to expand into complementary businesses or our latitude in dealing with travel service providers (such as by limiting our ability to provide discounts, rebates, or incentives or to exercise contractual rights), any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or ability to grow and compete.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Booking Holdings explicitly stated that restaurant reservations through OpenTable did not contribute to gross bookings, a key financial metric that included only travel-related services like room nights and airline tickets. This exclusion emphasized that OpenTable was not yet integrated into the company's core revenue-generating metrics. By 2023, however, OpenTable was elevated to being one of the five primary consumer-facing brands (alongside Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, and KAYAK), indicating a strategic shift to position OpenTable as a more central part of the company\u2019s brand portfolio and consumer experience. This change suggests that Booking Holdings was beginning to view restaurant reservations as a more integral component of its broader travel ecosystem, even if it remained outside the gross bookings metric. The repositioning reflects a broader strategic effort to enhance the value proposition for consumers by offering integrated travel and dining services.",

We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period operating and financial results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates.\n\n## Operating and Statistical Metrics\n\nOur financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking and other business activity generated by our travel and travel-related services. Specifically, reservations of room nights, rental car days, and airline tickets capture the volume of units booked through our OTC brands by our travel reservation services customers. Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services booked through our OTC brands by our customers, net of cancellations, and is widely used in the travel business. Our non-OTC brands (KAYAK and OpenTable) have different business metrics from those of our OTC brands, so search queries through KAYAK and restaurant reservations through OpenTable do not contribute to our gross bookings.\n\nRoom nights, rental car days, and airline tickets reserved through our services for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n\n",

These additional shares contributed to an increase in the equity base. In the same year, HD disclosed that dividend equivalents accrue on deferred shares granted to non-employee directors and are paid out in the form of additional shares upon termination of service. By 2023, HD's performance share awards and restricted stock units also included dividend equivalents that accrued as reinvested shares and were paid upon vesting or payout. The increase in additional shares from ASR agreements in 2022 likely expanded the equity pool, influencing the calculation and payout of dividend equivalents in 2023, particularly as these were tied to stock issuance events such as vesting or termination.",

In 2024, the structure remained consistent, but the timing of hedge accounting discontinuation and recognition of gains or losses in Other (income) expense, net, was refined\u2014particularly in cases where forecasted transactions were no longer probable within the initial or extended two-month period.

      "answer": "In 2023, Nike entities primarily purchased products from NTC, which sourced from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars, exposing Nike to foreign currency risk when NTC sold to entities with different functional currencies. By 2024, Nike continued to depend on NTC as a sourcing hub, but the increased volume of non-functional currency product purchases led to more pronounced foreign exchange exposures. This resulted in more frequent reclassification of gains and losses from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) into Net Income, as some forecasted transactions failed to occur within the initially identified time periods. Consequently, Nike\u2019s foreign exchange risk management strategy placed greater emphasis on dynamic hedging of intercompany transactions and demand creation expenses, beyond just product costs, to stabilize cash flows.",

        "Hop 2: Product \u2192 NTC: NTC acted as a sourcing hub, buying Nike-branded products and selling them to Nike entities in their local functional currencies, creating foreign exchange exposure.",
        "Hop 3: NTC \u2190 NKE(2024): Nike continued to depend on NTC, but the increase in non-functional currency product purchases led to more frequent cash flow hedge accounting adjustments and expanded hedging focus."

      "question": "How did Tesla's direct use of U.S. Bank National Association for debt financing in 2024 reflect a shift in its capital structure strategy compared to its 2023 reliance on SolarCity's existing indenture with the same institution?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Tesla maintained its relationship with U.S. Bank National Association primarily through SolarCity, which had its own indenture with the bank dating back to October 15, 2014 (Exhibit 4.16). This structure meant Tesla's exposure to U.S. Bank was indirect and inherited through its acquisition of SolarCity. However, in 2024, Tesla demonstrated a strategic shift by directly engaging U.S. Bank as a trustee for its debt instruments, as seen in the continued reference to Tesla's own indenture with U.S. Bank dated May 22, 2013 (Exhibit 4.15). This transition from an indirect to a direct relationship suggests Tesla was consolidating its capital structure and asserting more direct control over its debt financing arrangements, aligning its financial infrastructure with its broader post-acquisition integration strategy.",

        "Hop 1: TSLA(2023) \u2192 SolarCity: Tesla's 2023 filing shows it maintained financial relationships through SolarCity, including inherited indentures.",

      "question": "How did the weighted-average grant date fair value of LOW's deferred shares, which earn dividend equivalents, change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's non-employee director compensation structure?",
      "answer": "The weighted-average grant date fair value of LOW's deferred shares increased from $200.27 in 2023 to $221.29 in 2024, indicating a deliberate upward adjustment in the value of compensation awarded to non-employee directors. Deferred shares earn dividend equivalents that accrue and are paid out in additional shares upon termination of service, meaning the increase in grant date fair value directly enhances the overall compensation value. This suggests that LOW may have strategically elevated its director compensation package to align with market trends or to incentivize board service more effectively in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [LOW](2023) \u2192 [Dividend Equivalents]: In 2023, LOW disclosed that deferred stock units earn dividend equivalents and outlined vesting and expensing policies for non-employee directors.",
        "Hop 2: [Dividend Equivalents] \u2192 [Deferred Shares]: Deferred shares earn dividend equivalents that accrue and are paid out in additional shares upon payout of the underlying shares, linking the financial mechanics of the two instruments.",
        "Hop 3: [Deferred Shares] \u2190 [LOW](2024): In 2024, LOW reported an increase in the weighted-average grant date fair value of deferred shares to $221.29 from $200.27 in 2023, showing a clear upward trend in the value of director compensation."

      "answer": "GM's fixed income investment strategy remained consistent between 2023 and 2024, maintaining high quality funds as the dominant component and mentioning high yield funds only as a smaller, secondary allocation. In 2023, GM disclosed its fixed income funds included investments in high quality funds and, to a lesser extent, high yield funds. This phrasing was nearly identical in the 2024 disclosures, indicating no significant shift in emphasis. Additionally, the 2024 filings noted approximately $3.6 billion in U.S. reverse repurchase agreements, suggesting continued focus on liquidity and high-quality instruments rather than an increased appetite for yield-seeking investments.",

        "Hop 1: GM(2023) \u2192 High Yield Funds: GM disclosed that its fixed income funds included investments in high quality funds and, to a lesser extent, high yield funds.",
        "Hop 2: High Yield Funds \u2192 Fixed Income Funds: High yield funds are a subset of fixed income funds, which are used to manage pension plan investments and balance risk and return.",
        "Hop 3: Fixed Income Funds \u2190 GM(2024): In 2024, GM again disclosed that fixed income funds included high quality funds with high yield funds mentioned as a smaller component, and highlighted a significant $3.6 billion in U.S. reverse repurchase agreements."

Fixed income funds include investments in high quality funds and, to a lesser extent, high yield funds. High quality fixed income",

      "question": "How did the availability of shares under Tesla's 2019 Equity Incentive Plan in 2022 compare to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's use of Stock Appreciation Rights as part of its equity compensation strategy over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Tesla reported that 49.0 million shares were reserved and available for issuance under the 2019 Plan, which includes Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) as one of the grant types. By 2024, the number of shares reserved and available for issuance under the same plan had increased to 113.0 million. This significant increase suggests that Tesla expanded its capacity for equity compensation, including SARs, likely to continue incentivizing employees and executives amid growth or performance targets. The inclusion of SARs in the 2019 Plan indicates a strategic use of flexible equity instruments to align compensation with stock performance, and the larger share reserve in 2024 reflects an increased emphasis or anticipated usage of such instruments.",

Since Converse is a key producer of Nike's Accessories line, this downturn likely weakened the performance of that product category. By fiscal 2024, while there is no explicit revenue figure provided for Accessories, the continued focus on Converse's standalone reporting and the absence of a rebound narrative in the 2024 10-K suggests that the Accessories line did not experience a significant recovery. The lack of renewed emphasis on Accessories in Nike's consolidated revenue breakdown indicates that the impact of Converse's 2023 performance may have persisted into 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\n\nNIKE , I nc. is a worldwide leader in the design, developm ent and worldwide m arketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipm ent, accessories and services. N IKE , Inc. portfolio brands include the N IKE  Brand, Jordan Brand and C onverse. T he N IKE  Brand is focused on perform ance athletic footwear, apparel, equipm ent, accessories and services across M en's, W om en's and Kids', am plified with sport-inspired lifestyle products carrying the Swoosh tradem ark, as well as other N IKE  Brand tradem arks. T he Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jum pm an tradem ark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective N IKE  Brand geographic operating segm ents. C onverse designs, distributes, licenses and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the C onverse, C huck Taylor, All Star, O ne Star, Star C hevron and Jack P urcell tradem arks. In som e m arkets outside the U .S., these tradem arks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, m arket and sell sim ilar products. O perating results of the C onverse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statem ents include the accounts of N IKE , Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"C om pany\" or \"N IKE \"). All significant intercom pany transactions and balances have been elim inated.\n\n## MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statem ents in conform ity with generally accepted accounting principles requires m anagem ent to m ake estim ates, including estim ates relating to assum ptions that affect the reported am ounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statem ents and the reported am ounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from  these estim ates.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of N IKE  Brand footwear, apparel and equipm ent, as well as C onverse products, com prise a single perform ance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to custom ers either through wholesale or direct to consum er channels. T he C om pany satisfies the perform ance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the custom er has occurred, based on the term s of sale. A custom er is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product.\n\nControl is transferred to wholesale custom ers upon shipm ent or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreem ent with the custom er. C ontrol transfers to retail store custom ers at the tim e of sale and to substantially all digital com m erce custom ers upon shipm ent. T he transaction price is determ ined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and m iscellaneous claim s from  custom ers. P aym ent term s for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreem ent with the custom er and paym ent is generally required within 90 days or less of shipm ent to or receipt by the wholesale custom er. P aym ent is due at the tim e of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\n\nConsideration for tradem ark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangem ents, and the associated revenues are recognized over the license period.\n\nTaxes assessed by governm ental authorities that are both im posed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the C om pany from  a custom er, are excluded from  R evenues and C ost of sales in the C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a custom er are accounted for as fulfillm ent costs and are included in C ost of sales when the related revenues are recognized.\n\n## SALES-RELATED RESERVES\n\nConsideration prom ised in the C om pany's contracts with custom ers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and m iscellaneous claim s from custom ers. The C om pany estim ates the m ost likely am ount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against R evenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the tim e revenues are recognized. T he estim ated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in P repaid expenses and other current assets on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. P rovisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual program s and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 63",

      "question": "How did the change in NKE's foreign currency exposure related to NTC-sourced product costs between 2022 and 2023 affect the company's hedging strategy for non-functional currency denominated product purchases?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NKE's foreign currency exposure from NTC-sourced product costs stemmed from NTC selling products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies, creating foreign currency exposure for NTC when those currencies differed from the U.S. Dollar. NKE managed this exposure through a foreign currency adjustment program with factories and the use of currency forward and option contracts, which were generally accounted for as cash flow hedges. By 2023, NKE continued to rely on the NTC for product sourcing but expanded its hedging program to include more comprehensive cash flow hedge accounting, particularly for product cost exposures generated through non-functional currency denominated purchases. This evolution indicates a strategic shift toward more structured and formalized hedging of transactional exposures, especially as NKE emphasized the use of derivatives to manage the variability in product costs due to exchange rate fluctuations. The company also clarified its accounting treatment for ineffective hedge results and discontinued hedges, suggesting a more refined and risk-aware approach to managing foreign exchange risk in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE(2022) \u2192 NTC: NKE relied on the NTC, a U.S. Dollar functional entity, to source products from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars, which created foreign currency exposure when NTC sold to NIKE entities with different functional currencies.",
        "Hop 2: NTC \u2192 Product: NTC supplied NIKE-branded products to various NIKE entities globally, directly linking its sourcing operations to product cost exposures.",
        "Hop 3: Product \u2190 NKE(2023): In 2023, NKE refined its foreign exchange risk management program, particularly focusing on hedging product cost exposures from non-functional currency purchases, including enhanced use of cash flow hedges and clearer accounting treatment for such instruments."

          "chunk_text": "## TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product Costs - NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\n- b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated.\n\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales - A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other Costs - Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities - Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 43",

By 2023, the company continued to rely on NTC for U.S. Dollar-denominated product purchases but emphasized non-functional currency denominated product purchases as a primary source of foreign currency exposure, indicating a shift in focus toward managing external supplier relationships rather than internal sourcing adjustments. This evolution suggests that NKE refined its inventory cost management strategy by prioritizing external hedging mechanisms over internal currency adjustments, particularly as a stronger U.S. Dollar increased inventory costs in prior years, prompting more targeted risk mitigation in 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "## TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product Costs - NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\n- b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated.\n\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales - A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other Costs - Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities - Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 43",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nWe are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2022, are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar, and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nOur earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.\n\n## MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT\n\nWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk ('VaR'). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt.\n\nWe use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a 'variance/covariance' technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the 'delta' and 'gamma') to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.\n\nThe VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.\n\nThe estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $99 million and $92 million as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-year as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31, 2022. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $170 million and $184 million during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 50",

The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions.

      "question": "How did the increase in NIKE's share repurchase program from $15 billion in fiscal 2022 to $18 billion in fiscal 2023 influence the relative ownership and voting power dynamics between Class A and Class B shareholders, particularly in light of NIKE's dual-class stock structure and anti-takeover provisions?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, NIKE operated under a $15 billion share repurchase program, with $8.7 billion already spent by May 31, 2022, primarily targeting Class B shares. In June 2022, the Board authorized a new $18 billion program replacing the prior one, signaling a strategic shift to further consolidate equity and potentially reduce the float of publicly traded Class B shares. Since Class A shares, which are not publicly traded but convertible into Class B shares, grant holders 66 2/3% of the combined voting power (with Class B holding the remaining 33 1/3%), increased repurchases of Class B shares could amplify the relative voting influence of Class A shareholders. This effect is reinforced by NIKE's anti-takeover provisions in fiscal 2023, which include structural governance elements like separate voting on certain issues and a board election mechanism favoring Class A shareholders, further entrenching their control. Thus, the larger buyback program likely accelerated the concentration of voting power among Class A holders, aligning with long-term corporate governance objectives.",

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\n\nNIKE's Class B Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol NKE. At July 8, 2022, there were 22,214 holders of record of NIKE's Class B Common Stock and 15 holders of record of NIKE's Class A Common Stock. These figures do not include beneficial owners who hold shares in nominee name. The Class A Common Stock is not publicly traded, but each share is convertible upon request of the holder into one share of Class B Common Stock. Refer to our Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity for dividends declared on the Class A and Class B Common Stock.\n\nIn June 2018, the Board of Directors approved a four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program. As of May 31, 2022, the Company had repurchased a total of 77.4 million shares at an average price of $111.98 per share for a total approximate cost of $8.7 billion under this program.\n\nIn June 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new four-year, $18 billion program to repurchase shares of the Company's Class B common stock. The Company's new program will replace the current $15 billion share repurchase program, which will be terminated in fiscal 2023. Repurchases under the Company's new program will be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The new share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended at any time at the Company's discretion.\n\nAll share repurchases were made under NIKE's publicly announced program, and there are no other programs under which the Company repurchases shares. The following table presents a summary of share repurchases made during the quarter ended May 31, 2022:\n\n",

      "answer": "GM's pension fund allocation strategy evolved significantly between 2022 and 2024, showing a shift in risk exposure from developed market equities toward more conservative instruments like reverse repurchase agreements. In 2022, GM disclosed that equity funds invested in companies incorporated or domiciled in developed and emerging market countries, indicating a strategy of global equity exposure. By 2024, the disclosures highlighted a notable presence of U.S. reverse repurchase agreements totaling $3.6 billion, alongside smaller Canadian reverse repos of $185 million and $137 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. This shift from equity investments to reverse repos suggests a de-risking strategy, reducing exposure to equity market volatility while favoring more liquid and stable return instruments.

      "answer": "In 2023, GM emphasized crossovers as a core product within its strategic initiatives, marketing them through both retail and fleet channels, and engaging nonconsolidated affiliates in the development, production, and marketing of these vehicles. The 2023 filing notes that transactions with these affiliates included purchases and sales of component parts and vehicles related to crossovers. By 2024, GM continued these transactions with nonconsolidated affiliates, maintaining their involvement in crossover-related activities. However, the filings do not provide specific dollar amounts or volume metrics for these transactions, making it difficult to quantify whether there was an increase, decrease, or reallocation in the scope of engagement. To fully assess the strategic adjustment, more detailed financial data on affiliate transactions from both years would be needed.",

      "answer": "In 2022, TSLA reported 35 million shares related to warrants as part of its diluted share count, contributing to a total of 1,129 million diluted shares. By October 2024, the 2019 Warrantholders exercised their warrants, resulting in the issuance of 2,894,424 additional shares of common stock. This exercise directly increased the number of outstanding shares, reflecting a tangible shift in TSLA's equity structure due to warrant dilution.

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, Nike implemented a tax restructuring strategy that resulted in a 4.7% deferred tax benefit, aimed at reducing taxable income in future periods. This restructuring occurred in the context of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which introduced a Fifteen Percent Minimum Tax based on adjusted financial statement income, effective for Nike starting June 1, 2023. Despite these changes, Nike reported in fiscal 2024 that the combined impact of the tax restructuring and the new minimum tax provisions did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

      "answer": "In 2022, NKE's sourcing through NTC involved significant foreign currency exposure due to NTC purchasing from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars and selling to NIKE entities in their functional currencies, which were often non-USD. This created exposure for NTC and downstream NIKE entities when the U.S. Dollar fluctuated. Additionally, NKE had a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories to offset exposure from factory input costs, which were indexed to a basket of currencies. By 2024, NKE continued to rely on third-party factories for production, with similar exposure dynamics, but the documentation emphasized increased use of currency forward contracts to hedge exposure from non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, suggesting a more formalized risk management strategy. The evolution from 2022 to 2024 shows a shift from primarily natural offsets to a more structured hedging program, particularly for managing inventory cost volatility tied to USD fluctuations against indexed currencies.",

          "chunk_text": "## TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product Costs - NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\n- b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated.\n\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales - A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other Costs - Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities - Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 43",

Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product Costs - NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\n- b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories.

      "question": "What does the shift in GM's pension fund allocation from preferred stocks in 2022 to $3.6 billion in U.S. reverse repurchase agreements by 2024 indicate about their evolving risk management strategy within equity fund investments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM's pension fund disclosed investments in equity funds that included U.S. common and preferred stocks, indicating a strategy that embraced equity market exposure. By 2024, the disclosures showed a notable shift: equity funds still played a role, but were now accompanied by $3.6 billion in U.S. reverse repurchase agreements. This shift suggests a more conservative risk management approach, prioritizing short-term, secured liquidity instruments over direct equity exposure. The move from preferred stocks\u2014typically offering stable dividends but with equity market risk\u2014to reverse repos indicates a strategic pivot toward capital preservation and reduced volatility in pension fund performance.",

By fiscal 2023, Converse's revenues had decreased by 15% on a currency-neutral basis, with declines in both North America and Western Europe. This drop was driven by a 12% decrease in combined unit sales across wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels, and a 3% decline in average selling price (ASP), largely due to increased promotional activity. The Accessories segment, as part of Converse's broader product lineup, was therefore indirectly impacted by these performance trends, which also affected gross margins due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates and lower full-price ASP.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\n\nNIKE, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE, Inc. portfolio brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley, prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2020, and Converse. The NIKE Brand is focused on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services across Men's, Women's and Kids', amplified with sport-inspired lifestyle products carrying the Swoosh trademark, as well as other NIKE Brand trademarks. The Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. Sales and operating results of Hurley brand products, prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2020, were reported within the NIKE Brand's North America geographic operating segment. Refer to Note 20 - Acquisitions and Divestitures for information regarding the divestiture of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Hurley. Converse designs, distributes, licenses and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\" or \"NIKE\"). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nEconomic sanctions imposed on Russia during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, impacted the Company's local business and a reduction in the Ruble liquidity affected the Company's ability to manage operational impact and related foreign currency risk. As a result, the Company deconsolidated its Russian legal entities, which resulted in a one-time, pre-tax charge of $96 million recognized within Other (income) expense, net, classified within Corporate. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2022, the Company made the decision to leave the Russian marketplace.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product.\n\nControl is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control transfers to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\n\nConsideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangements, and the associated revenues are recognized over the license period.\n\nTaxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenues are recognized.\n\n## SALES-RELATED RESERVES\n\nConsideration promised in the Company's contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. The Company estimates the most likely amount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against Revenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 62",

      "answer": "The significant increase in shares reserved under Tesla's 2019 Equity Incentive Plan from 49.0 million in 2022 to 113.0 million in 2024 indicates an expanded emphasis on equity-based compensation as a strategic tool for attracting and retaining top talent.

      "answer": "BKNG benefited from the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax in both 2022 and 2023, which taxed qualifying income at 9% rather than the standard Dutch corporate rate of 25.8% (effective from 2022). In 2022, the effective tax rate was higher compared to 2021, partly due to a reduced benefit from the Innovation Box Tax. In 2023, a significant portion of BKNG's taxable earnings was still subject to this preferential rate, indicating continued reliance on the Innovation Box Tax. However, the reduced benefit in 2022 suggests a potential shift in qualifying earnings or eligibility, highlighting the sensitivity of BKNG's international tax strategy to changes in Dutch Corporate Income Tax Law.",

Our 2020 effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges related to OpenTable and KAYAK, U.S. federal tax associated with our international earnings, and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by the benefit of the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax.\n\nOur effective tax rate was lower for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges related to OpenTable and KAYAK that were recorded in December 31, 2020, lower U.S. federal and state tax associated with our international earnings and lower unrecognized tax benefits.\n\nUnder Dutch corporate income tax law, income generated from qualifying innovative activities is taxed at a rate of 9% (\"Innovation Box Tax\") for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021, rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25%. Previously, the Innovation Box Tax rate was 7%. Effective January 1, 2022, the Netherlands corporate income tax rate increased from 25% to 25.8%. A portion of Booking.com's earnings during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 qualified for Innovation Box Tax treatment, which had a significant beneficial impact on our effective tax rates for these periods. While we expect Booking.com to continue to qualify for Innovation Box Tax treatment with respect to a portion of its earnings for the foreseeable future, the loss of the Innovation Box Tax benefit could substantially increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows in future periods.

      "answer": "In 2022, Nike pursued acquisitions to support its Consumer Direct Offense strategy while also divesting entities in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, with $182 million in held-for-sale assets and $58 million in held-for-sale liabilities. By 2024, Nike's reliance on the Nike Trading Company (NTC) remained central to its sourcing model, as NTC continued to purchase products from third-party factories predominantly in U.S. Dollars and resell them to Nike entities in local currencies. This created foreign currency exposure that Nike actively hedged through its cash flow hedging program. The shift toward divestitures in 2022 indicates a strategic pivot toward streamlining operations, which likely increased Nike\u2019s reliance on centralized sourcing through NTC, amplifying the importance of foreign exchange risk management tied to NTC\u2019s U.S. Dollar-based transactions by 2024.",

The impact of acquisitions, individually and in aggregate, was not considered material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## DIVESTITURES\n\nDuring fiscal 2020, as a result of the Company's decision to transition its wholesale and direct to consumer operating model in certain countries within its APLA operating segment to third-party distributors, the related assets and liabilities of these entities were classified as held-for-sale within Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Accrued liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company entered into separate definitive agreements to sell its entities in Argentina and Uruguay as well as its entity in Chile to third-party distributors. The assets and liabilities of these entities will remain classified as held-forsale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the transactions close, which is expected to occur prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, held-for-sale assets were $182 million, primarily consisting of $73 million of Accounts receivable, net and $59 million of Inventories; held-for-sale liabilities were $58 million, primarily consisting of $26 million of Accrued liabilities and $20 million of Accounts payable.\n\nAs of May 31, 2021, held-for-sale assets were $175 million, primarily consisting of $76 million of Inventories and $59 million of Accounts receivable, net; held-for-sale liabilities were $72 million, primarily consisting of $25 million of Accounts payable and $22 million of Accrued liabilities.",

      "answer": "BKNG's effective tax rate in 2023 was lower compared to 2022, primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and lower unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by a reduced benefit from the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax. In 2022, the effective tax rate was higher due to a lower benefit from the Innovation Box Tax and an increased valuation allowance. Under Dutch Corporate Income Tax Law, income from qualifying innovative activities was taxed at 9% in both years, compared to the statutory rate of 25.8% in 2023. This indicates that while the Innovation Box Tax continued to provide a significant benefit, its relative contribution to the effective tax rate decreased over time, suggesting a potential shift or adjustment in BKNG's international tax planning strategy.",

      "question": "How did Tesla's reliance on Panasonic Corporation for battery supply evolve from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of contractual agreements and production pricing adjustments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Tesla's relationship with Panasonic Corporation centered around the supply of batteries under long-standing agreements, including the 2011 Supply Agreement and its amendments, which governed the procurement of battery cells. By 2023, Tesla had expanded its contractual framework with Panasonic, adding new pricing agreements such as the 2021 Pricing Agreement (Japan Cells) executed in December 2020 and the 2020 Pricing Agreement (Gigafactory 2170 Cells) entered in June 2020. These agreements indicate a shift from foundational supply arrangements to more detailed, production-specific pricing frameworks, reflecting a deepened strategic partnership. The evolution suggests Tesla's increasing reliance on Panasonic for tailored battery solutions, supported by updated pricing and production terms.",

      "answer": "In 2022, NKE incurred $16 million in operating overhead expenses related to cash awards under the LTIP, indicating a reliance on cash-based long-term incentives. By 2023, the company transitioned to stock-based awards, with approximately 116 million shares of Class A Common Stock authorized under the LTIP for equity compensation. This shift aligns executive incentives with shareholder value creation but also increased governance risk, as Class A Common Stock carries special voting rights that entrench board control and heighten anti-takeover provisions. The move from cash to equity compensation reflects a strategic pivot toward aligning executive pay with stock performance, while also amplifying structural governance risks tied to dual-class share structures.",

The Company recognized $16 million, $78 million and $66 million of Operating overhead expense related to cash awards under the LTIP during the years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, under the Stock Incentive Plan, the Company granted PSUs which replaced cash-based long-term incentive awards historically granted under the Company's LTIP. Refer to Note 11 - Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for further information related to PSUs.\n\nThe Company allows certain highly compensated employees and non-employee directors of the Company to defer compensation under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. A rabbi trust was established to fund the Company's nonqualified deferred compensation plan obligation. The assets in the rabbi trust of approximately $876 million and $945 million as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily consist of company owned life insurance policies recorded at their cash surrender value and are classified in Deferred income taxes and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred compensation plan liabilities were $890 million and $944 million as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and primarily classified in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company has pension plans in various countries worldwide. The pension plans are only available to local employees and are generally government mandated. The liability related to the unfunded pension liabilities of the plans was $30 million and $64 million as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and primarily classified as non-current in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## NOTE 14 - RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES\n\nThe Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nThe Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions and assessing, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of the hedging relationships.\n\nThe majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2022, are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based on the instrument's maturity date.",

In 2024, the company expanded the context of dividend equivalents to include performance share awards, where equivalents accrue as reinvested shares and are paid upon award payout, often subject to performance conditions such as ROIC and operating profit targets over a three-year cycle or EBITDA and sales targets for SRS acquisition-related awards.

This contributed to a lower effective tax rate compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate. In 2023, BKNG again benefited from the Innovation Box Tax at the same 9% rate, but the benefit decreased compared to 2022. This decrease, despite lower international tax rates and a lower valuation allowance, contributed to a relatively stable effective tax rate year-over-year.

Our 2020 effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges related to OpenTable and KAYAK, U.S. federal tax associated with our international earnings, and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by the benefit of the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax.\n\nOur effective tax rate was lower for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges related to OpenTable and KAYAK that were recorded in December 31, 2020, lower U.S. federal and state tax associated with our international earnings and lower unrecognized tax benefits.\n\nUnder Dutch corporate income tax law, income generated from qualifying innovative activities is taxed at a rate of 9% (\"Innovation Box Tax\") for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021, rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25%. Previously, the Innovation Box Tax rate was 7%. Effective January 1, 2022, the Netherlands corporate income tax rate increased from 25% to 25.8%. A portion of Booking.com's earnings during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 qualified for Innovation Box Tax treatment, which had a significant beneficial impact on our effective tax rates for these periods. While we expect Booking.com to continue to qualify for Innovation Box Tax treatment with respect to a portion of its earnings for the foreseeable future, the loss of the Innovation Box Tax benefit could substantially increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows in future periods.

      "answer": "In 2022, BKNG faced intense competition in the online restaurant reservation services market from large tech companies like Google, which were expanding into travel and restaurant reservation services using their broader platforms and user bases. This pressure prompted BKNG to maintain a diversified brand portfolio to remain competitive. OpenTable, which BKNG already offered as a leading brand for online restaurant reservations in 2022, remained a strategic asset in 2023 as BKNG continued to stake its position in the restaurant reservation space. In 2023, BKNG explicitly listed OpenTable among its five primary consumer-facing brands, indicating a sustained strategic focus despite competitive threats. This continuity reflects BKNG's intent to leverage OpenTable\u2019s established presence to counter competitive pressures and maintain relevance in the restaurant reservation market.",

The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive, constantly evolving, and subject to rapid change, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent, Amazon, and Facebook, have significantly more customers or users, consumer data, and financial and other resources than we do, and may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to compete more effectively with us. For example, Google has entered the online travel market and grown rapidly by linking travel search services to its dominant search functionality through flight, hotel, and alternative accommodations meta-search products (\"Google Flights\", \"Google Hotel Ads\", and \"Google Vacation Rentals\"), its \"Book on Google\" reservation functionality, \"Google Travel\" (a planning tool that aggregates its flight, hotel, and packages products), and integrating its hotel meta-search products and restaurant information and reservation products into Google Maps. In particular, Google Hotel Ads and Google Flights have grown rapidly and achieved significant market share in a relatively short time. As the economy and the travel industry recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the structure of the travel industry or consumer preferences could change in ways that could disadvantage us and benefit certain of our existing competitors or new entrants. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting international travel restrictions and social distancing practices, we saw a shift in favor of domestic travel and alternative accommodations. This shift could benefit competitors that are more well established in domestic markets and alternative accommodations than we are. As a result, our historical strengths may not provide the competitive advantages that they did prior to the pandemic. If we are unable to successfully adapt to any changes in how the travel industry operates or to changes in the ways in which consumers purchase travel services, our ability to compete, and therefore our business and results of operations, would be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently, or may in the future, compete with companies that provide a variety of products and services, including:\n\n- online travel reservation services;\n- online accommodation search and/or reservation services that are focused primarily on alternative accommodations;\n- large online companies, including search, social networking and marketplace companies;\n- traditional travel agencies, travel management companies, wholesalers and tour operators, many of which combine physical locations, telephone services, and online services;\n- travel service providers (e.g., accommodations, rental car companies, or airlines) that have their own branded online platforms to which they drive business;\n- online travel meta-search and price comparison services;\n- \"Super apps\" that offer consumers a wide range of everyday and other services including travel bookings;\n- companies offering new rental car business models or car- or ride-sharing services that affect demand for rental cars, some of which have developed innovative technologies to improve efficiency of point-to-point transportation and extensively utilize mobile platforms;\n- online restaurant reservation services; and\n- companies offering technology services and software solutions to travel service providers, including large global distribution systems (\"GDSs\") and hospitality software platforms.\n\nMeta-search services leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search results for the consumer's specific itinerary across travel service providers, online travel companies (\"OTCs\"), and other online platforms and in many instances compete directly with us for customers. Google leverages its general search business to promote its meta-search offerings by showing meta-search results at the top of its organic search results. Google and other meta-search services may evolve into more traditional OTCs by offering consumers the ability to make travel reservations directly through their platforms. If consumers book travel services through a service such as TripAdvisor's \"Instant Booking,\" Google's \"Book on Google,\" or directly with a travel service provider without using an OTC like us, or if meta-search services limit our participation within",

The market value of Class B shares stood at $133.47 billion in 2024, significantly higher than the $7.4 billion market value of Class A shares, indicating continued concentration of voting power among Class A shareholders.

      "answer": "In 2023, McDonald's effective tax rate was 19.5%, and the company noted that while Pillar 2 global minimum tax legislation had been enacted in several countries with an effective date after December 31, 2023, it did not expect a material impact on its financial statements. By 2024, the effective tax rate increased to 20.5%, and the company reiterated that the global minimum tax enactment had not yet had a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. This suggests that while the Pillar 2 framework was being implemented globally, McDonald's tax planning and compliance strategies were able to absorb any initial effects, maintaining a relatively stable tax rate. However, the 1 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate could indicate early adjustments in anticipation of future compliance requirements or changes in profit allocation strategies in response to the new global tax framework.",

Cumulativ e foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensiv e loss as of February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024 were losses of $970 million and $365 million, respectiv ely.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nASU No. 2023-07. In Nov ember 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, 'Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improv ements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,' which is intended to improv e reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The disclosure requirements included in ASU No. 2023-07 are required for all public entities, including entities with a single reportable segment. ASU No. 2023-07 is effectiv e for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance is required to be applied on a retrospectiv e basis. We adopted ASU No. 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The adoption of this guidance resulted in additional financial statement disclosures and had no impact to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 2 which includes the disclosures resulting from our adoption of this guidance.\n\nASU No. 2022-04. In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations,' to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs used by an entity in connection with the purchase of goods and serv ices. The standard requires entities that use supplier finance programs to disclose the key terms of such programs, along with an annual rollforward of the related obligations, including the amount of obligations confirmed and the amounts paid during the period. ASU No. 2022-04 was effectiv e for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the required rollforward information, which was effectiv e for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We adopted ASU No. 2022-04 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, with the exception of the annual rollforward requirement, which was adopted on a prospectiv e basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The adoption of this guidance did not hav e an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n## Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nASU No. 2023-09. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 'Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improv ements to Income Tax Disclosures,' which requires disclosure of disaggregated information about a reporting entity's effectiv e tax rate reconciliation as well as disclosures on income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU No. 2023-09 is effectiv e for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance is required to be applied on a prospectiv e basis, with the option to apply the standard retrospectiv ely. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently ev aluating the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.",

      "question": "How did the voting rights structure of NKE's Class B Common Stock in 2023 influence the governance dynamics reflected in the Class A Common Stock disclosures in 2024, particularly in relation to anti-takeover provisions and shareholder voting on corporate actions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, NKE's Class B Common Stock was subject to anti-takeover provisions that limited its voting rights except in specific circumstances such as mergers or amendments to the certificate of incorporation, which could discourage unsolicited takeovers. This governance structure was further clarified in 2024, where Class A Common Stockholders retained full voting rights on all matters, while Class B Common Stockholders had limited voting rights, only applicable in defined events like mergers or exiting the core payments business. By 2024, the aggregate market value of Class B Common Stock was $133.47 billion, significantly larger than the $7.40 billion for Class A, suggesting that the majority of shares lacked broad voting power. This reinforced the influence of Class A shareholders over corporate governance and strategic decisions, maintaining a strong anti-takeover posture through differential voting rights.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE(2023) \u2192 Class B Common Stock: NKE's 2023 filing disclosed that Class B Common Stock had limited voting rights and was subject to anti-takeover provisions that discouraged unsolicited takeovers.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Class B shares only had voting rights in limited circumstances, while Class A shares had full voting rights, creating a governance imbalance.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 NKE(2024): In 2024, NKE's filing showed that Class A Common Stockholders had full voting rights and that the market value of Class B shares was significantly higher, reinforcing the governance dominance of Class A shares."

      "answer": "In 2022, GM held significant investments in nonconsolidated affiliates, with the carrying amount exceeding net assets by $4.2 billion, indicating a strong financial commitment to these partnerships. These affiliates were directly involved in the development and production of crossovers, among other vehicle types. By 2024, GM's segment reporting emphasized a strategic focus on vehicle-level profitability metrics during planning and program lifecycle stages. This suggests that the earlier investment in nonconsolidated affiliates likely supported the production capacity and possibly the design or cost structure of crossovers, enabling GM to better align with its profitability goals in 2024. The continuity of crossovers in GM\u2019s product lineup and the emphasis on optimizing their profitability indicates a strategic evolution from financial investment in affiliates to tangible product outcomes and margin improvements.",

Segment Reporting\n\nOur chief operating decision-maker, who is our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, analyzes the results of our business through the following reportable segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and Cruise through EBIT-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates GM Financial through EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are an integral part of its operational and financial performance. These financial metrics are used to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions and to monitor budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis. To manage operations and make decisions regarding resource allocations, our chief operating decision-maker is regularly provided and reviews expense information at a consolidated, functional level for our global purchasing and supply chain, manufacturing and engineering functions. Warranty and quality metrics are also viewed on a consolidated basis. Currently, a focus is being placed on driving an efficient, consolidated fixed cost structure and managing overall global headcount. V ehiclelevel profitability metrics are also reviewed during the planning stage and throughout a program's life cycle on a forecasted basis, and not on an actual basis. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategic initiatives.\n\nSubstantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.\n\nGMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily  China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the  Baojun,  Buick,  Cadillac,  Chevrolet and  Wuling brands.  Cruise  is  our  global  segment  responsible  for  the  development  of  AV   technology,  and  includes  AV -related  engineering  and  other  costs.  We  provide automotive financing services through our GM Financial segment.\n\nOur automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/V auxhall Business (primarily pension costs), corporate expenditures and certain revenues and expenses that are not part of a reportable segment are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and intersegment balances.

      "answer": "In 2022, NIKE's foreign currency exposure from product purchases through NTC was primarily due to NTC selling products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies, creating foreign currency risk for NTC when those currencies differed from the U.S. Dollar. By 2024, NIKE had refined its foreign exchange risk management program, which included hedging product cost exposures generated through non-functional currency-denominated purchases from NTC. This evolution reflects a more strategic approach to managing the variability in inventory costs caused by exchange rate fluctuations, particularly as NTC continued to serve as a key intermediary purchasing from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars and reselling globally. The shift indicates a more integrated use of derivatives and natural offsets to stabilize cost of sales.",

          "chunk_text": "## TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product Costs - NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\n- b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated.\n\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales - A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other Costs - Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities - Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 43",

      "answer": "In 2023, NKE's foreign currency exposure from NTC-sourced product costs arose primarily from intercompany purchases denominated in U.S. Dollars, which were then sold to international NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies, creating foreign exchange risk. By 2024, the company continued this sourcing model but refined its hedging strategy by designating more derivatives as cash flow hedges, aiming to reduce the volatility of currency fluctuations on consolidated results. This evolution indicates a more strategic and proactive approach to managing foreign exchange risk, particularly around product cost exposures, by aligning hedge accounting more closely with forecasted transactions and extending hedging periods under rare extenuating circumstances.",

        "Hop 1: NKE(2023) \u2192 NTC: NKE sourced products through NTC, a U.S. Dollar-based hub, creating foreign exchange exposure when selling to non-U.S. Dollar functional currency entities.",

An inability to effectively manage the risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations.\n\nThe growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations. Further, the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop, negotiate, and enforce appropriate terms and conditions of commercial and other agreements, as well as the performance of our business partners under such agreements, are critical to our business. Our international licensees may face capital constraints or other factors, including legal constraints, that may limit the speed at which they are able to ex pand and develop in a certain market. Our Channel Development business is heavily reliant on Nestl\u00e9, which has the global right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. If Nestl\u00e9 fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect, and grow our brand in Channel Development, our Channel Development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business, and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Our retail licensed operations are concentrated in a relatively small number of large licensees. If they are not able to access sufficient capital or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the applicable markets.\n\n## Risks Related to Supply Chain\n\n## Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business operations and financial results.\n\nThe availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast, and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the 'C' price. This premium depends upon, among other factors, the supply and demand at the time of purchase, and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the 'C' coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and impact our ability to enter into fix ed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base 'C' coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established.\n\nThe supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increases in farm input costs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions, and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. For example, extreme weather conditions such as drought or frost in Brazil have impacted coffee prices in the past, and in the likely event that such weather conditions were to reoccur, become more frequent, and/or increase in severity in the future, they may have similar or worse consequences on coffee price volatility. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance.\n\nWe also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, other commodities, including tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs, and energy, as well as non-food and beverage inputs, such as the components that comprise our packaging materials, are important to our operations, as is the processing of these inputs. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Similarly, increases in the cost of, or lack of availability of, whether due to supply shortages, or delays or interruptions in the processing of, plant-based alternatives could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.",

      "question": "How did the voting rights structure for NKE's Class A and Class B common stock evolve between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to corporate control transactions and the calculation methodology involving conversion rates?",
      "answer": "In fiscal year 2023, NKE\u2019s governance structure granted Class A common stockholders control over three-quarters of the Board of Directors, creating a strong anti-takeover mechanism. Class B common stock had limited voting rights, only participating in specific corporate control matters. By 2024, the structure remained largely unchanged, with Class A retaining its board election control and Class B still excluded from general voting. However, the 2024 V_10k filing introduced a more detailed voting rights framework: Class B common stockholders would vote together as a single class in specified merger or consolidation scenarios, with votes calculated based on the number of shares held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate on the record date. This refined voting calculation methodology, explicitly tied to conversion rates, was not detailed in the 2023 filing, indicating a formalization of voting mechanics for Class B shares in corporate control events.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE(2023) \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Class A stockholders elected three-quarters of the Board, reinforcing anti-takeover provisions.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: In 2024, Class B shares voted in corporate control events using a vote count based on shares held \u00d7 conversion rate, revealing a structured dependency.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 NKE(2024): The 2024 10-K confirmed Class B shares retained limited voting rights, but the V_10k_2024 filing added new detail on voting mechanics tied to conversion rates in specific transactions."

This structure was designed to empower the Board to negotiate better acquisition terms or deny coercive attempts, but it also carried the risk of discouraging proxy contests and delaying change in control. By 2024, the continued existence of this dual-class structure, with Class B Common Stock being publicly traded, maintained the imbalance in voting power and board influence. The 2024 disclosures reaffirmed the entrenched governance model, suggesting no material changes to the stock-class framework that underpins board control and takeover defense. Thus, the entity chain shows a stable evolution, with the relationship between Class A and Class B stockholders remaining a central feature of NKE\u2019s corporate governance strategy across both years.",

A weaker U.S. Dollar reduced inventory costs, while a stronger Dollar increased them. By 2024, Nike had expanded its foreign exchange risk management program to include more comprehensive hedging of product cost exposures, particularly for non-functional currency-denominated purchases. This included using cash flow hedges to mitigate the variability in inventory costs caused by exchange rate fluctuations, indicating a strategic shift toward more active risk mitigation. The evolution from a passive exposure management approach in 2022 to a more proactive hedging strategy in 2024 reflects Nike's growing emphasis on stabilizing product cost impacts in a volatile currency environment.",

Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product Costs - NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\n- b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated.\n\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales - A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other Costs - Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities - Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 43",

      "answer": "In 2023, Nike disclosed that its dual-class structure, where Class A shareholders elect 75% of the board and Class B shares carry more voting power, was designed to protect against coercive takeovers. This structure remained unchanged in 2024, as evidenced by the continued existence of two separately voting classes. Despite Class B shares having a market value of $133.5 billion compared to Class A's $7.4 billion as of November 30, 2023, the governance framework still concentrated control in Class B holders. This power asymmetry continued to act as an anti-takeover mechanism by enabling Class B shareholders to maintain board control and resist unsolicited acquisition attempts, even though the extreme market valuation gap raised potential concerns about minority shareholder influence and value alignment.",

      "question": "How did the revenue contribution from accessories through Converse change between 2022 and 2024, and what does this indicate about Nike's strategic positioning of lifestyle products within its portfolio?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Converse, which includes accessories in its product lineup, contributed $2.346 billion in revenue to Nike's total revenue of $46.710 billion. By 2024, Converse's revenue had decreased to $2.082 billion, while Nike's total revenue increased to $51.362 billion. This indicates a relative decline in the contribution of Converse (and by extension, its accessory segment) from 5.0% of total revenue in 2022 to 4.0% in 2024. This shift suggests that Nike's strategic focus may have moved away from lifestyle accessories under Converse toward other segments or brands within its portfolio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE(2022) \u2192 Accessories: In 2022, Nike produced accessories as part of its broader product portfolio, with Converse being a key brand responsible for accessories.",

        "Hop 3: Converse \u2190 NKE(2024): In 2024, Converse remained a reportable segment within Nike, but its revenue contribution had declined compared to total Nike revenue, indicating a shift in strategic emphasis."

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\n\nNIKE, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE, Inc. portfolio brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley, prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2020, and Converse. The NIKE Brand is focused on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services across Men's, Women's and Kids', amplified with sport-inspired lifestyle products carrying the Swoosh trademark, as well as other NIKE Brand trademarks. The Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. Sales and operating results of Hurley brand products, prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2020, were reported within the NIKE Brand's North America geographic operating segment. Refer to Note 20 - Acquisitions and Divestitures for information regarding the divestiture of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Hurley. Converse designs, distributes, licenses and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\" or \"NIKE\"). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nEconomic sanctions imposed on Russia during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, impacted the Company's local business and a reduction in the Ruble liquidity affected the Company's ability to manage operational impact and related foreign currency risk. As a result, the Company deconsolidated its Russian legal entities, which resulted in a one-time, pre-tax charge of $96 million recognized within Other (income) expense, net, classified within Corporate. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2022, the Company made the decision to leave the Russian marketplace.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product.\n\nControl is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control transfers to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\n\nConsideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangements, and the associated revenues are recognized over the license period.\n\nTaxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenues are recognized.\n\n## SALES-RELATED RESERVES\n\nConsideration promised in the Company's contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. The Company estimates the most likely amount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against Revenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 62",

G lobal Brand D ivisions revenues include NIKE  Brand licensing and other m iscellaneous revenues that are not part of a geographic operating segm ent. G lobal Brand D ivisions costs represent dem and creation and operating overhead expense that include product creation and design expenses centrally m anaged for the N IKE  Brand, as well as costs associated with N IKE  D irect global digital operations and enterprise technology.\n\nCorporate consists prim arily of unallocated general and adm inistrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally m anaged departm ents; depreciation and am ortization related to the C om pany's headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and com pensation program s, including stock-based com pensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses.\n\nThe prim ary financial m easure used by the C om pany to evaluate perform ance of individual operating segm ents is earnings before interest and taxes (\"E BIT \"), which represents N et incom e before Interest expense (incom e), net and Incom e tax expense in the C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\nAs part of the C om pany's centrally m anaged foreign exchange risk m anagem ent program , standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each N IKE  Brand entity in the C om pany's geographic operating segm ents and to C onverse. These rates are set approxim ately nine and twelve m onths in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons, and one standard rate applies to the spring and sum m er selling seasons) based on average m arket spot rates in the calendar m onth preceding the date they are established. Inventories and C ost of sales for geographic operating segm ents and C onverse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity's functional currency. D ifferences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual m arket rates are included in C orporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from  the C om pany's centrally m anaged foreign exchange risk m anagem ent program  and other conversion gains and losses.\n\nAccounts receivable, net, Inventories and P roperty, plant and equipm ent, net for operating segm ents are regularly reviewed by m anagem ent and are therefore provided below.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 86",

      "question": "How has HD's approach to compensating non-employee directors through deferred shares evolved from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of dividend equivalent payouts and their alignment with long-term shareholder interests?",
      "answer": "In 2023, HD granted deferred shares to non-employee directors, with dividend equivalents accruing and being paid out in the form of additional shares upon termination of board service. By 2024, HD shifted to a model where dividend equivalents on similar equity instruments (restricted stock units) were paid out in additional shares upon vesting, rather than upon termination. This represents a transformation in the company\u2019s director compensation philosophy, moving toward vesting-based alignment with long-term shareholder value creation rather than service completion. The change likely encourages longer director engagement and closer alignment with stock performance over time, as vesting conditions typically depend on continued service and/or performance metrics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: HD(2023) \u2192 Deferred Shares: In 2023, HD explicitly granted deferred shares to non-employee directors, with dividend equivalents paid out as additional shares upon termination of service.",
        "Hop 2: Deferred Shares \u2192 Additional Shares: Dividend equivalents on deferred shares in 2023 were accrued and paid in the form of additional shares upon payout, which occurred at termination of board service.",
        "Hop 3: Additional Shares \u2190 HD(2024): By 2024, HD\u2019s disclosures indicated that dividend equivalents on restricted stock units were paid in additional shares upon vesting, not termination, signaling a shift in payout timing and incentive structure."

The structural voting rights disparity\u2014where Class A shares hold 66\u2154% of the combined voting power\u2014remained unchanged, suggesting that the continued emphasis on repurchasing Class B shares may have reinforced the market\u2019s perception of Class B equity as the primary vehicle for shareholder returns, despite its lower governance influence.",

The Company's new program will replace the current $15 billion share repurchase program, which will be terminated in fiscal 2023. Repurchases under the Company's new program will be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The new share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended at any time at the Company's discretion.\n\nAll share repurchases were made under NIKE's publicly announced program, and there are no other programs under which the Company repurchases shares.

The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class  B  common stock having 15 votes per share.  The  Class  B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\n## Div idends\n\nWe expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.

      "question": "How did the evolution of Nike's foreign currency exposure management through third-party factories and the NTC from 2022 to 2024 impact the scale and structure of their cash flow hedging program?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Nike had $18.5 billion in outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, with an embedded derivative program tied to third-party factories and the NTC, where foreign currency exposure indices were used to adjust payments based on labor, materials, and overhead costs in multiple currencies. By 2024, Nike continued to rely on the NTC as a central sourcing hub, purchasing from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars and reselling to international entities in their functional currencies, indicating that the core structure of foreign currency exposure remained intact. However, the continuation and refinement of the cash flow hedging program through 2024 suggests that Nike likely scaled or adapted its hedging strategies to maintain financial stability amid ongoing currency fluctuations. This evolution shows a consistent dependency on both the NTC and third-party factories, with Nike adjusting its hedging instruments\u2014such as cash flow hedges and embedded derivatives\u2014to manage exposure across the supply chain over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE(2022) \u2192 Third-Party Factories: Nike had a foreign currency adjustment program with third-party factories, where payments were adjusted based on a basket of currencies tied to factory input costs, creating embedded derivatives.",
        "Hop 2: Third-Party Factories \u2192 NTC: The NTC, as a sourcing hub, purchased products from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars and sold them to Nike entities in their functional currencies, creating foreign currency exposure for the NTC.",

          "chunk_text": "functional currency result in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nThe Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the Company's existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, the Company's payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order. Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below.\n\nThe Company's policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $18.5 billion as of May 31, 2022.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, approximately $607 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2022, the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 24 months.\n\n## FAIR VALUE HEDGES\n\nThe Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. The Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## NET INVESTMENT HEDGES\n\nThe Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## UNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/or embedded derivative contracts. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net, together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position and/or embedded derivative contract. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $3 billion as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES\n\nAs part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. In addition, embedded derivative contracts are created when the Company enters into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts. Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net, through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, the total notional amount of embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $584 million.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 82",

          "chunk_text": "## TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product Costs - NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\n- b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated.\n\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales - A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other Costs - Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities - Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 43",

      "answer": "In 2023, Sojitz America remained the sole holder of NKE's redeemable preferred stock, which carried a cumulative dividend of $0.10 per share payable annually on May 31. This structure meant that no dividends could be declared or paid on common stock unless preferred dividends were paid in full. By 2024, this arrangement had not changed, reinforcing a rigid capital structure constraint. As a result, NKE's dividend policy for common stock in 2024 had to account for this mandatory prior obligation, potentially limiting flexibility in returning capital to common shareholders. The lack of change in the preferred stock structure also meant that the company could not issue additional preferred shares, preserving Sojitz America\u2019s unique position while constraining strategic capital adjustments.",

T he m ajority of the total gross unrecognized tax benefits are long-term  in nature and included within D eferred incom e taxes and other liabilities on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Com pany recognizes interest and penalties related to incom e tax m atters in Incom e tax expense. As of M ay 31, 2024 and 2023, accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $332 m illion and $268 m illion, respectively (excluding federal benefit) and were included within D eferred incom e taxes and other liabilities on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nAs of M ay 31, 2024 and 2023, long-term  incom e taxes payable unrelated to unrecognized tax benefits were $266 m illion and $373 m illion, respectively, and were included within Deferred incom e taxes and other liabilities on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Com pany is subject to taxation in the U .S., as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. T he C om pany is currently under audit by the U .S. IR S for fiscal years 2017 through 2019.

Although the tim ing of resolution of audits is not certain, the C om pany evaluates all dom estic and foreign audit issues in the aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of lim itations, and estim ates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $35 m illion within the next 12 m onths.\n\nI n J anuary 2019, the E uropean C om m ission opened a form al investigation to exam ine whether the N etherlands has breached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company. The C om pany believes the investigation is without m erit. If this m atter is adversely resolved, the N etherlands m ay be required to assess additional am ounts with respect to prior periods, and the C om pany's incom e taxes related to prior periods in the N etherlands could increase.\n\nA portion of the C om pany's foreign operations benefit from  a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2031. T his tax holiday m ay be extended when certain conditions are m et or m ay be term inated early if certain conditions are not m et. T he tax benefit attributable to this tax holiday, before taking into consideration other U .S. indirect tax provisions, was $338 m illion, $263 m illion and $221 m illion for the fiscal years ended M ay 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. T he benefit of the tax holiday on diluted earnings per com m on share, before taking into consideration other U .S. indirect tax provisions, was $0.22, $0.17 and $0.14 for the fiscal years ended M ay 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 8 - REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK\n\nSojitz Am erica is the sole owner of the C om pany's authorized redeem able preferred stock, $1 par value, which is redeem able at the option of Sojitz Am erica or the C om pany at par value aggregating $0.3 m illion. A cum ulative dividend of $0.10 per share is payable annually on M ay 31, and no dividends m ay be declared or paid on the com m on stock of the Company unless dividends on the redeem able preferred stock have been declared and paid in full.

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Nike disclosed the existence of its redeemable preferred stock, fully issued to Sojitz America, with a par value of $0.3 million and an annual cumulative dividend of $0.10 per share payable on May 31.

The consistent dividend policy meant that no dividends could be declared or paid on Nike's common stock unless the preferred dividends were fully settled. Despite the static nature of the preferred stock terms, the growing profitability and tax benefits of Nike over this period\u2014evidenced by increasing tax holiday benefits from $221 million in 2022 to $263 million in 2023\u2014could have increased the relative opportunity cost of retaining earnings due to constraints imposed by the preferred stock dividend obligations.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM reported a $4.2 billion goodwill investment in nonconsolidated affiliates, which were explicitly involved in the development, production, and marketing of trucks. These affiliates contributed to the manufacturing and supply chain processes for vehicles, including trucks, as stated in the 2022 filing. In 2023, GM noted that trucks were sold to fleet customers such as daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies, and governments. The nonconsolidated affiliates played a direct role in the production of these trucks, which were later sold into fleet markets. Therefore, the 2022 goodwill investment supported the ongoing production capabilities of these affiliates, which fed into the fleet sales activities described in 2023.",

      "question": "How did Converse's 2022 apparel segment performance influence Nike's 2023 apparel revenue growth trajectory?",
      "answer": "Converse's 2022 apparel segment showed strong direct-to-consumer (DTC) growth of 22%, driven by digital demand, and a 12% increase in average selling price (ASP), despite a 4% decline in wholesale revenues. This DTC momentum and pricing power contributed to Nike's broader apparel revenue performance in 2023, where the total Nike Brand apparel revenue reached $13.843 billion. Converse itself contributed $90 million to this total, indicating its role in supporting Nike's overall apparel growth strategy. The 7% year-over-year revenue growth for Converse in 2022 (currency-neutral) likely provided a foundational uplift that fed into Nike\u2019s 2023 apparel results, especially through the DTC channel, which accounted for 47% of Nike\u2019s total revenues in 2023.",

We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan.\n\n## FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021\n\nOn a currency-neutral basis, Converse revenues increased 7% for fiscal 2022 due to revenue growth in North America, Western Europe and licensee markets, partially offset by declines in Asia. Direct to consumer revenues increased 22%, led by strong digital demand. Wholesale revenues decreased 4%, primarily due to ongoing marketplace dynamics in China as well as global supply chain constraints. Combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct to consumer channels decreased 6%, while ASP increased 12%, driven by growth in direct to consumer.\n\nReported EBIT increased 23%, driven by gross margin expansion and higher revenues, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 360 basis points as higher margins in direct to consumer, growth in licensee revenues, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, and higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, were partially offset by higher product costs due to increased freight, duty and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense increased primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense, while operating overhead increased primarily due to higher professional services costs.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Lowe's executed a $3.0 billion Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) agreement, receiving a total of 11.9 million shares, which directly reduced the total share count available for equity-based compensation and shareholder distributions. This share reduction increased the relative weight of outstanding equity awards, including deferred stock units (DSUs) that accrue dividend equivalents. By 2024, Lowe's disclosed that DSUs granted to non-employee directors continued to earn dividend equivalents, which are paid out in additional shares upon termination of service. The earlier share repurchase activity in 2022, including the ASR, indirectly amplified the per-share impact of dividend equivalents by reducing the overall share base, thereby increasing the number of shares ultimately delivered under DSU awards. This demonstrates a temporal chain where share repurchases (2022) \u2192 increased per-share value/dividend equivalents (intermediate effect) \u2192 higher dividend equivalent obligations tied to DSUs (2024).",

      "question": "How did NIKE's $18 billion Class B share repurchase program authorized in 2022 impact the relative voting power dynamics between Class A and Class B shareholders by 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NIKE authorized an $18 billion share repurchase program targeting Class B common stock, which was publicly traded and held the majority of outstanding shares. Class A shares, while fewer in number (only 15 holders of record in 2022), carried full voting rights, whereas Class B shares had limited voting rights only on specific matters. By repurchasing Class B shares, the company reduced their outstanding count, which, by 2024, would increase the relative voting influence of Class A shareholders. This is because Class A shares retained broader voting rights on general corporate matters, and as the total number of voting-eligible shares decreased through repurchases, the proportional control by Class A holders would have grown. This dynamic suggests a strategic shift toward consolidating voting power among long-term or insider shareholders who typically hold Class A shares.",

Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 - Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable.\n\nMarketable Debt Securities We generally classify marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. V arious factors, including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value with non-credit related unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Noncredit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent non-binding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of ex it prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the finance receivables. For retail finance receivables, GM Financial uses static pool modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected remaining life of the finance receivables. The economic forecasts incorporate factors which vary by region that GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as forecasted auto industry conditions, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.  Net realizable value is the estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  less  cost  to  sell,  and  considers  general  market  and  economic  conditions,  periodic  reviews  of  current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs.

We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on forecasted auction proceeds when there is a reliable basis to make such a determination.

      "answer": "In 2023, GM had significant transactions with nonconsolidated affiliates involved in the development, production, and marketing of trucks and automobile parts, indicating strategic collaboration in core product areas. These partnerships likely contributed to GM\u2019s 2024 strategy where trucks were sold not only through traditional retail dealers but also to fleet customers such as daily rental companies and governments, and distributed globally through both established (Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC) and local (Baojun, Wuling) brands. The 2024 sales approach, which expanded beyond North America and integrated both dealer and direct fleet channels, reflects the ongoing influence of these nonconsolidated affiliates in enhancing production capacity and distribution reach.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GM explicitly reported transactions with nonconsolidated affiliates for the purchase and sale of automobile parts and vehicles, indicating a material operational reliance on these entities for component supply. By 2024, while no specific transaction values were disclosed, the filing emphasized a strategic focus on 'driving an efficient, consolidated fixed cost structure' and managing the 'global purchasing and supply chain' at a consolidated functional level. This shift in language suggests a potential strategic move toward greater vertical integration or centralized control of supply chain functions, reducing reliance on nonconsolidated partners for parts production. The lack of specific affiliate transaction figures in 2024, contrasted with their explicit mention in 2023, implies a reorientation of supply chain strategy toward internal coordination.",

However, the 2020 impairment test extended the expected recovery timeline beyond five years due to reduced monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services. By 2023, restaurant reservations remained a part of BKNG's advertising and other revenues, which were primarily driven by OpenTable's reservation services and subscription fees.

See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the acquisition of Getaroom in December 2021.\n\nWe review long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, before interest and taxes, of the related asset group. As of December 31, 2021, no impairment indicators were identified for our long-lived assets.\n\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test goodwill at a reporting unit level and our annual goodwill impairment tests are performed as of September 30. As of September 30, 2021, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill. No additional impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## 2020 Interim Goodwill Impairment Test\n\nDue to the significant and negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), we performed an interim period goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020 and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $489 million related to the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended March 31, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.5 billion at March 31, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted near-term cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK as well as the significant decline in comparable companies' market values as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying the recent decline in enterprise values of comparable publicly-traded companies to the recently calculated fair value for OpenTable and KAYAK as well as applying comparable company multiples).\n\nThe income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. In the cash flow projections, we assumed at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would experience a significant decline in near-term cash flows with a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance (including profitability) occurring in 2023. The shape and timing of the recovery was a key assumption in our fair value calculation (both in the income and market approaches).\n\n## 2020 Annual Goodwill Impairment Test\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $573 million for the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit for the three months ended September 30, 2020, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.0 billion at September 30, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK, reflecting a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, mainly due to the continued material adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the flight vertical at KAYAK, and the lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services.\n\nThe estimated fair value of OpenTable and KAYAK was determined using a combination of standard valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (applying comparable company multiples).\n\nThe income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projections. The income approach, applied as of September 30, 2020, reflected a reduction in the forecasted cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK and a longer assumed recovery period to 2019 levels of profitability, driven primarily by a lowered outlook for monetization opportunities in restaurant reservation services and slower than previously expected recovery trends for airline travel, which is a key vertical for KAYAK. For the interim goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020, we expected a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance occurring in 2023 for OpenTable and KAYAK. Based on our evaluation of all relevant information available as of September 30, 2020 for the annual goodwill impairment test, we expected at the time that OpenTable and KAYAK would not return to the 2019 level of profitability within five years from that date, and that it was uncertain whether the shape of the recovery would ultimately match our expectations.

      "question": "How did the change in the foreign currency exposure management strategy between NKE's third-party factories and NTC from 2022 to 2023 affect the company's overall hedging activity and financial risk profile?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NKE had a foreign currency adjustment program with third-party factories, where it assumed certain factory currency exposures through embedded derivatives and cash flow hedges, with a total notional amount of $584 million in embedded derivatives and $18.5 billion in outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. These exposures were primarily linked to the NTC, which purchased products from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars and then sold them to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies, creating foreign currency exposure for the NTC when those entities had different functional currencies. By 2023, NKE continued to rely on the NTC as a central sourcing hub, maintaining the same purchasing structure, but the focus of the foreign exchange risk management program emphasized increased hedging of product costs, non-functional currency revenues, and intercompany transactions. This suggests that while the structural relationship between third-party factories and NTC remained stable, NKE refined its hedging strategy to better manage the downstream foreign currency exposure from NTC to operating entities, likely increasing the efficiency of its risk mitigation as seen in the continued emphasis on cash flow hedges and expanded coverage of transactional exposures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE(2022) \u2192 Third-Party Factories: NKE had a foreign currency adjustment program with factories, assuming their currency exposures through embedded derivatives and cash flow hedges, with $584M in embedded derivatives and $18.5B in total foreign currency derivatives.",
        "Hop 2: Third-Party Factories \u2192 NTC: NTC purchased products from third-party factories in USD and sold them to NIKE entities in their functional currencies, creating foreign currency exposure for NTC when those entities had different functional currencies.",
        "Hop 3: NTC \u2190 NKE(2023): In 2023, NKE continued to use NTC as a sourcing hub and expanded its foreign exchange risk management program to include more comprehensive hedging of product costs and intercompany transactions."

          "chunk_text": "functional currency result in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nThe Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the Company's existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, the Company's payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order. Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below.\n\nThe Company's policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $18.5 billion as of May 31, 2022.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, approximately $607 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2022, the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 24 months.\n\n## FAIR VALUE HEDGES\n\nThe Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. The Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## NET INVESTMENT HEDGES\n\nThe Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## UNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/or embedded derivative contracts. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net, together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position and/or embedded derivative contract. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $3 billion as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES\n\nAs part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factory's acceptance of NIKE's purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. In addition, embedded derivative contracts are created when the Company enters into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts. Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, net, through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, the total notional amount of embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $584 million.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 82",

          "chunk_text": "## TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product Costs - NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\n- b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ('factory currency exposure index') in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ('factory input costs') are denominated.\n\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales - A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other Costs - Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net. Refer to Note 14 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\n- Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities - Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 43",

      "question": "How did Nike's acquisition strategy in fiscal 2022 impact its foreign exchange risk exposure through the Nike Trading Company (NTC) in fiscal 2024, particularly in relation to non-functional currency product purchases?",
      "answer": "Nike's acquisitions in fiscal 2022, which were aimed at enhancing its Consumer Direct Offense strategy, expanded its global footprint and operational complexity. This expansion increased the number of Nike entities operating in different functional currencies. By fiscal 2024, this led to greater foreign exchange exposure, particularly in product cost management, as these newly acquired entities likely increased the volume of non-functional currency purchases through the Nike Trading Company (NTC). The NTC, which predominantly buys products in U.S. Dollars from third-party factories and sells them to Nike entities in their respective functional currencies, became more critical in managing this FX risk. Nike responded by enhancing its foreign exchange risk management program, including the use of cash flow hedges to mitigate the variability in cash flows caused by NTC transactions across multiple currencies.",

The impact of acquisitions, individually and in aggregate, was not considered material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## DIVESTITURES\n\nDuring fiscal 2020, as a result of the Company's decision to transition its wholesale and direct to consumer operating model in certain countries within its APLA operating segment to third-party distributors, the related assets and liabilities of these entities were classified as held-for-sale within Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Accrued liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company entered into separate definitive agreements to sell its entities in Argentina and Uruguay as well as its entity in Chile to third-party distributors.

      "answer": "In 2022, Converse was positioned as a key lifestyle brand within Nike\u2019s portfolio, achieving 7% currency-neutral revenue growth driven by performance in North America, Western Europe, and licensee markets. This growth was supported by a 22% increase in direct-to-consumer revenue and higher average selling prices (ASPs), despite supply chain constraints and a decline in Asian markets. By 2024, Nike continued to emphasize Converse as a distinct lifestyle brand, maintaining it as a reportable segment focused on 'athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel and accessories.' This continuity in strategic positioning is reflected in Nike's 2024 segment reporting, where Converse remains a standalone entity within Nike\u2019s operating structure, suggesting that the success and brand identity cultivated in 2022 contributed to its ongoing role in bolstering Nike\u2019s lifestyle apparel and footwear offerings in 2024.",

Gross margin increased approximately 360 basis points as higher margins in direct to consumer, growth in licensee revenues, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, and higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, were partially offset by higher product costs due to increased freight, duty and logistics costs.

      "answer": "In 2023, Nike's foreign currency exposure from product purchases through the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), which buys products in U.S. Dollars and sells them to Nike entities in their respective functional currencies, was managed through cash flow hedge instruments. Changes in fair value of these derivatives were recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss) until the hedged transactions affected Net Income. By 2024, the continued reliance on NTC for product sourcing meant that foreign currency fluctuations still impacted Nike's consolidated results, prompting Nike to maintain its foreign exchange risk management program. However, if forecasted hedged transactions were no longer probable of occurring within the initially identified time period or within an additional two-month window, Nike discontinued hedge accounting and recognized the gains or losses immediately in Other (income) expense, net. This shift in accounting treatment reflects a more reactive approach to managing currency risk tied to NTC, indicating a potential evolution in Nike\u2019s risk management strategy.",

      "question": "How did BKNG's 2022 pandemic-related challenges with travel service providers influence its 2023 strategic positioning of KAYAK as a meta-search service, particularly considering KAYAK's dependence on access to travel service data and BKNG's ownership stake?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BKNG faced significant challenges due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic, including reduced consumer travel, restrictions on international movement, and weakened relationships with travel service providers, which were already under financial strain and at risk of bankruptcy. These challenges disrupted BKNG's ability to offer a robust range of travel services and placed pressure on its core business model. KAYAK, as a meta-search service, depends heavily on access to real-time travel data from online travel companies (OTCs) and travel service providers to maintain its value proposition to consumers and advertisers. BKNG's 2023 filings show that KAYAK remained a core part of the company\u2019s portfolio, with BKNG maintaining full ownership of the brand. This suggests a strategic decision to leverage KAYAK's model\u2014less reliant on direct booking commissions and more on advertising and referral fees\u2014as a counterbalance to the instability in traditional travel service provider relationships. By 2023, BKNG likely aimed to strengthen KAYAK's position to mitigate the risks identified in 2022, especially regarding the volatility of travel service provider participation and the potential for reduced distribution through third-party platforms.",

          "chunk_text": "variants of COVID-19 has caused uncertainty as to when restrictions will be lifted, if additional restrictions may be initiated or reimposed, if there will be permanent changes to travel behavior patterns, and the timing of distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other medical interventions globally.\n\nIn 2021, many countries experienced spikes in COVID-19 cases due to the spread of variants of COVID-19. We believe that as vaccines and other medical interventions that prevent or reduce the impact of COVID-19 become widespread globally, people will increasingly feel it is safe to travel again and government restrictions will be relaxed, although the timing remains uncertain.\n\nOur business is dependent on the availability of a large number of accommodations (particularly independently-owned accommodations) and restaurants, and on the ability of consumers to travel to such accommodations and restaurants on airlines, railways, and rental cars. The ability of consumers to travel across international borders has been significantly impacted by the various travel restrictions between countries. We do not expect economic and operating conditions for our business to recover fully until there is widespread consumer confidence and ability to travel, and our travel service provider and restaurant partners are able to meet the demand for services. This may not occur until well after the broader global economy begins to improve. Additionally, our business is also dependent on consumer sentiment and discretionary spending patterns. Any increased unemployment is likely to have a negative impact on consumer discretionary spending, including for the travel and restaurant industries. Even though we have seen some improvements in the economic and operating conditions for our business since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot predict the long-term effects of the pandemic on our business or the travel and restaurant industries as a whole. If the travel and restaurant industries are fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic in ways that are detrimental to our operating model, our business may continue to be adversely affected even as the broader global economy recovers.\n\nOur financial results and prospects are almost entirely dependent on the sale of travel-related services. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions and government restrictions resulted in a material decrease in consumer spending and a significant decline in travel and restaurant activities and consumer demand for related services. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant changes to our accommodation room nights trends. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Trends. The extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments. These include, but are not limited to, the severity, extent, and duration of the global pandemic, including as a result of any new variants of COVID-19 and any resurgences of the pandemic; availability and efficacy of vaccines and other medical interventions to prevent or alleviate COVID-19, and their impacts on the travel and restaurant industries and consumer spending more broadly; actions taken by national, state, and local governments to contain the disease or treat its impact; the impact on attrition, as well as the changes in hiring levels and remote working arrangements that we have implemented on our operations, including the health and productivity of management and our employees, and our ability to maintain our financial reporting processes and related controls; the impact on our contracts and relationships with our partners; our ability to withstand increased cyberattacks; the speed and extent of the recovery across the broader travel ecosystem; and the duration, timing, and severity of the impact on customer spending, including how long it takes to recover from the economic recession resulting from the pandemic. The effects of the pandemic may continue to fluctuate throughout the world, which could continue to affect our business. Also, restrictions in affected regions could be extended after the virus has been contained in order to avoid relapses and there may be restrictions on certain travel activity related to whether travelers have been vaccinated. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business and financial performance, it may also heighten many of the other risks identified in this section.\n\nWe rely on the performance of highly skilled employees; and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key employees or hire, retain, and motivate well-qualified employees, our business would be harmed.\n\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals, including key senior management in the United States, Europe, and Asia. We may not be able to retain the services of members of our senior management or other key employees, the loss of whom could harm our business and competitive position. We had approximately 20,300 employees worldwide at December 31, 2021. Our future success and ability to innovate and develop products, services, technologies, and enhancements depends on our continuing to identify, attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled employees across our organization, and changes in our workforce may make that more difficult. In addition, our customer service resources and outsource arrangements for customer support may be unable to provide adequate customer service support, particularly during peak periods. As a result of the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential for a long recovery period for the travel industry, it is possible our employees may not view employment with us as positively as they did prior to the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and will have a long-term effect on how and from where people work, the attractiveness of our office environments, and remote working policies, and there may continue to be operational and workplace cultural challenges that may adversely affect our business, including talent retention, in the",

          "chunk_text": "reservations to customers through us. We are in regular dialogue with our major travel service providers about the nature and extent of their participation in our services. A significant reduction on the part of any of our major travel service providers or providers that are particularly popular with consumers for a sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on our business, market share, and results of operations. To the extent any of those major or popular travel service providers ceased to participate in our services in favor of one of our competitors' services or decided to require consumers to purchase services directly from them, our business, market share, and results of operations could be harmed. During periods of higher occupancy rates, accommodation providers may decrease their distribution of accommodation reservations through thirdparty intermediaries like us, in particular through our discount services. Further, as consolidation among travel service providers increases, the potential adverse effect of a decision by any particular significant travel service provider (such as a large hotel chain, airline, or rental car company) to withdraw from or reduce its participation in our services also increases. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk that our travel service provider and restaurant partners voluntarily or involuntarily declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease or limit their operations, which could harm our business and results of operations. In particular, the potential harm to our business and results of operations is greater if there are bankruptcies or closures of larger partners such as airlines, hotel chains, or large rental car companies. To the extent restaurants limit the availability of reservations through OpenTable or if a significant number of restaurants cease to participate in our services or if government restrictions limit occupant capacity of any travel service providers or restaurants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers may not continue to use our services and/or our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nKAYAK, a meta-search service, depends on access to information related to travel service pricing, schedules, availability, and other related information from OTCs and travel service providers to attract consumers. Many of KAYAK's agreements with OTCs and travel service providers are short-term agreements that may be terminated on 30 days' notice. To the extent OTCs or travel service providers no longer provide such information to KAYAK, KAYAK's ability to provide comprehensive travel service information to consumers could be diminished and its brand, business, and results of operations could be harmed. To the extent consumers do not view KAYAK as a reliable source of comprehensive travel service information, fewer consumers would likely visit its websites, which would also likely have a negative impact on KAYAK's advertising revenue and results of operations. In addition, if OTCs or travel service providers choose not to advertise with KAYAK or choose to reduce or eliminate the fees paid to KAYAK for referrals from query results, KAYAK's business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.\n\nWe have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies and acquisitions of complementary businesses in furtherance of our mission to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. For example, we acquired Getaroom in December 2021 to enhance our business-to-business distribution capabilities for hotel partners and more effectively support our accommodations affiliate partners, and in November 2021 we entered into an agreement to acquire European-based flights booking provider Etraveli Group. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of management's attention from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, new risks with which we are not familiar, legal compliance obligations that previously did not apply to us, integration risks, and difficulties and unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions. As a result, entering new businesses involves risks and costs that could, if realized, have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, profit margins, cash flows or financial condition, as well as on our ability to achieve the expected benefits of any such investments or acquisitions.\n\nWe may decide to make minority investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have limited or no management or operational control. The controlling person in such a case may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and decisions of the company or venture in which we invested may result in harm to our reputation or business or adversely affect the value of our investment.\n\nWe acquired a substantial portion of our goodwill and intangible assets in acquisitions. If we determine that any of our goodwill and intangible assets, or any goodwill or intangible assets acquired in future transactions experiences a decline in value we may be required to record an impairment, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Further, we may issue shares of our common stock in these transactions, which could result in dilution to our stockholders.\n\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or combine internal businesses.\n\nThe integration of acquired businesses requires significant time and resources, and we may not manage these processes successfully. In addition to acquired businesses, we have integrated certain of our businesses that had been managed",

      "answer": "In 2022, NIKE disclosed that there were 15 holders of record of Class A Common Stock, which is not publicly traded but convertible into Class B Common Stock, and a new $18 billion share repurchase program was authorized for Class B shares. Class A shares held 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, with Class B shares holding the remaining 33 1/3%, based on their respective outstanding counts and voting rights. By 2024, NIKE continued to disclose Class B Common Stock as its primary listed security on the NYSE under NKE, indicating sustained emphasis on Class B shares, likely influenced by the repurchase program initiated in 2022, which aimed to reduce outstanding shares and potentially consolidate voting power in the market.",

Dividends paid on unvested shares were immaterial for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019. Additionally, the majority of our restricted stock awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service.\n\nWe have also granted performance share awards under the Plans. These awards provide for the issuance of shares of our common stock at the end of the three-year performance cycle based upon our performance against target average ROIC and operating profit over that performance cycle. Additionally, the awards become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service and minimum performance targets are achieved. Recipients of performance share awards have no voting rights until the shares are issued following completion of the performance period. Dividend equivalents accrue on the performance shares (as reinvested shares) and are paid upon the payout of the award based upon the actual number of shares earned.\n\nThe fair value of the restricted stock and performance shares is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse.\n\nRestricted Stock Units. Each restricted stock unit entitles the associate to one share of common stock to be received upon vesting up to five years after the grant date. Additionally, the majority of these awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. Recipients of restricted stock units have no voting rights until the vesting of the award. Recipients receive dividend equivalents that accrue on unvested units and are paid out in the form of additional shares of stock on the vesting date.

      "question": "How did McDonald's exposure to Argentina's foreign exchange controls in 2023 influence its 2024 financial reporting adjustments regarding the exclusion of hyperinflationary markets from comparable sales calculations?",
      "answer": "In 2023, McDonald's faced significant challenges due to Argentina's foreign exchange controls, which introduced volatility and regulatory complexity to its operations in the country (Chunk 2). By 2024, McDonald's adjusted its financial reporting methodology by excluding Argentina from comparable sales calculations due to hyperinflation, defined as a cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeding 100% (Chunk 3). This adjustment reflects a strategic response to the ongoing instability linked to Argentina\u2019s regulatory environment, including the foreign exchange controls mentioned in 2023. The exclusion aims to provide a clearer view of underlying business trends by removing the distortions caused by hyperinflation and currency volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MCD(2023) \u2192 Foreign Exchange Controls: McDonald's was impacted by Argentina's 2023 amendments to foreign exchange controls, which increased operational and financial risks.",

        "Hop 3: Argentina \u2190 MCD(2024): By 2024, McDonald's excluded Argentina from comparable sales due to hyperinflation, citing the cumulative inflation threshold as the rationale."

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S VIEW OF THE BUSINESS\n\nIn analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures, some of which are considered to be non-GAAP, including comparable sales and guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, after-tax return on invested capital from continuing operations, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below. M anagement believes these measures are important in understanding the financial performance of the Company.\n\n- Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. M anagement reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other charges and gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.\n- Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales and transactions, respectively, at all restaurants, whether owned and operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction, natural disasters, pandemics and acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities. Restaurants in Russia were treated as permanently closed as of A pril 1, 2022 and therefore excluded from the calculation of comparable sales and comparable guest counts beginning in the second quarter of 2022. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any market considered hyperinflationary (generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%), which management believes more accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, McDonald's excluded results from Argentina and Lebanon in the calculation of comparable sales due to hyperinflation (V enezuela continues to be excluded). Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, the latter of which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix.\n- Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether owned and operated by the Company or by franchisees. Systemwide sales to loyalty members is comprised of all sales to customers who self-identify as a loyalty member when transacting with both Company-owned and operated and franchised restaurants. Systemwide sales to loyalty members are measured across 60 markets with loyalty programs. Systemwide sales to loyalty members represents an aggregation of the prior four quarters of sales to loyalty members active in the last 90 days of the respective quarter. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in Systemwide sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion.\n- The Company's after-tax return on invested capital (\"ROIC\") from continuing operations is a metric that management believes measures capital-allocation effectiv eness over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC differently, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies. Refer to the reconciliation in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K for further information on the Company's calculation of ROIC.\n- Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company's ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. Refer to the reconciliations in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K for further information on the Company's calculations of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate.",

      "question": "How did the voting rights structure for Class B Common Stock change between 2023 and 2024, and what implications did this have for shareholder influence during major corporate decisions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, NKE disclosed that Class B Common Stock had limited voting rights, particularly in the election of directors, and was only entitled to vote on specific matters such as mergers or amendments to the certificate of incorporation. Holders of Class B Common Stock could cast votes equal to the number of shares held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate during such defined events. By 2024, NKE continued to disclose Class B Common Stock as a key equity class, but no new voting rights or expanded influence mechanisms were introduced. The lack of change in voting rights for Class B Common Stock suggests that shareholder influence during major corporate decisions remained constrained in 2024, consistent with the 2023 structure. The 2023 disclosure of limited voting rights, combined with the 2024 status quo, indicates a stable governance framework with no new mechanisms to increase Class B shareholders' influence.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE(2023) \u2192 Voting Rights: Discloses limited voting rights for Class B Common Stock, with specific conditions under which voting is allowed.",
        "Hop 2: Voting Rights \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Voting rights are subject to the structure defined for Class B Common Stock, including vote allocation based on shares held and conversion rate.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 NKE(2024): NKE continues to disclose Class B Common Stock as a key equity class in 2024, with no indication of expanded voting rights."

      "answer": "Tesla's acquisition of SolarCity in 2017, as documented in the 2022 filings (Exhibit 10.56), led to a structural change in its relationship with U.S. Bank National Association. In 2014, SolarCity entered into an Indenture with U.S. Bank National Association as trustee (Exhibit 4.16), meaning Tesla indirectly had exposure to U.S. Bank through SolarCity\u2019s bond obligations, such as the 5.00% Solar Bonds Series 2015/6-10 (Exhibit 4.17). By 2024, Tesla had a direct regulatory relationship with U.S. Bank National Association, as evidenced by the ongoing obligations under Tesla\u2019s own Indenture dated May 22, 2013 (Exhibit 4.15). This shift from indirect oversight via SolarCity to direct obligations reflects a consolidation of regulatory exposure following the acquisition, with Tesla now directly liable for bond indentures previously managed by SolarCity.",

      "question": "How did the 15% currency-neutral revenue decline and 30% EBIT drop in Converse during fiscal 2023 impact Nike's 2024 apparel segment performance across North America, Western Europe, and Asia, given Converse's role as a reportable apparel segment within Nike's organizational structure?",
      "answer": "The 15% currency-neutral revenue decline in Converse during fiscal 2023, driven by decreases in both wholesale (16%) and direct-to-consumer (14%) channels, particularly in North America and Western Europe, directly affected Nike's consolidated apparel segment performance in fiscal 2024. As Converse is explicitly described in Nike's 2024 filing as a reportable apparel segment operating under Nike's organizational structure, its 30% EBIT drop contributed to margin pressures across Nike's broader apparel business. The gross margin contraction of approximately 130 basis points in Converse\u2014due to lower full-price ASP and higher costs\u2014was absorbed into Nike's consolidated results, impacting the overall financial health of the apparel category. While Converse saw partial offset from growth in Asia, this geographic pattern aligned with Nike's broader regional exposure, meaning the underperformance in key Western markets likely had a cascading effect on Nike's global apparel segment strategy and profitability in fiscal 2024.",

      "answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Nike saw a reduction in Class A shares from 305 million to 298 million, with at least 7 million Class A shares being converted into Class B shares during this period. This conversion contributed to the overall stability in Class B share count, which declined only slightly from 1,266 million in 2022 to 1,205 million in 2024 despite significant share repurchases totaling (92 million shares) over the two years. The continued presence of Class A shares, which carry different voting rights as noted in the UPS filing, suggests a strategic effort to maintain a dual-shareholder structure while gradually transitioning some Class A holders to the publicly traded Class B shares.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE(2022) \u2192 Class A Shares: In 2022, Nike had 305 million Class A shares outstanding, indicating a base level of insider or restricted ownership.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Shares \u2192 Class B Shares: As seen in the UPS filing, Class A shares are convertible into Class B shares and carry differentiated voting rights, establishing a functional and structural link between the two share classes.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Shares \u2190 NKE(2024): By 2024, Nike had repurchased 92 million Class B shares since 2022, yet the total Class B share count only dropped from 1,266 million to 1,205 million, suggesting that conversions from Class A to Class B helped offset some of the reduction from buybacks."

Class A and B shares both have a $0.01 par value, and as of December 31, 2024, there were 4.6 billion class A shares and 5.6 billion class B shares authorized to be issued.

      "answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, NKE converted 7 million Class A shares into Class B shares, contributing to a net decrease in Class A shares from 305 million to 298 million and a corresponding increase in Class B shares from 1,266 million to 1,205 million. This conversion, combined with share repurchases and stock option exercises, shifted the equity structure by increasing the proportion of publicly traded Class B shares relative to the more-voting-rights Class A shares, which are primarily held internally. The overall capital in excess of stated value also increased from $11,484 million in 2022 to $13,409 million in 2024, indicating a net inflow from equity transactions.",

        "Hop 1: NKE(2022) \u2192 Class B Shares: NKE reported 1,266 million Class B shares outstanding in 2022, with a capital in excess of stated value of $11,484 million.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Shares \u2192 Class A Shares: Class A shares are convertible into Class B shares and carry more voting rights, as seen in the UPS example where a similar dual-class structure exists.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, NKE's Greater China revenues decreased by 13% on a currency-neutral basis due to supply chain constraints, government restrictions from COVID-19, and marketplace dynamics. Since Taiwan is included within the Greater China segment, its performance would have aligned with these regional trends. By fiscal 2024, NKE's Greater China revenues reached $7.545 billion, showing some recovery, although this figure still reflects a slight decline compared to the $7.547 billion in fiscal 2022. This suggests that while the broader Greater China region, including Taiwan, experienced significant challenges in 2022, the region stabilized by 2024 with minimal change year-over-year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE(2022) \u2192 Taiwan: NKE operated in Taiwan as part of its broader Greater China market, which saw a 13% currency-neutral revenue decline in fiscal 2022 due to pandemic-related disruptions.",
        "Hop 2: Taiwan \u2192 Greater China: Taiwan is explicitly included within the Greater China geographic segment, meaning its business performance contributes to and aligns with the overall trends of the region.",
        "Hop 3: Greater China \u2190 NKE(2024): By fiscal 2024, NKE's Greater China revenues were reported at $7.545 billion, showing stabilization after the 2022 downturn, implying a similar trajectory for Taiwan as part of that region."

The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower revenues in Men's and Women's. NIKE Direct revenues decreased 12% due to digital sales declines of 15% and comparable store sales declines of 14%, in part due to reduced physical retail traffic as a result of government restrictions due to COVID-19 as well as ongoing marketplace dynamics, partially offset by the addition of new stores.\n\nCurrency-neutral footwear revenues decreased 10%, driven primarily by lower revenues in Men's and Women's. Unit sales of footwear decreased 7%, while lower ASP per pair reduced footwear revenues by approximately 3 percentage points, driven by lower NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs, reflecting higher discounts.\n\nCurrency-neutral apparel revenues decreased 21%, due primarily to lower revenues in Men's and Women's. Unit sales of apparel decreased 15%, while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 6 percentage points, primarily due to lower NIKE Direct and fullprice ASPs, reflecting higher discounts.\n\nReported EBIT decreased 27% due to lower revenues, gross margin contraction and higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin decreased approximately 390 basis points, reflecting impacts from COVID-19 related government restrictions which reduced physical retail traffic and led to higher inventory obsolescence reserves recognized primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross margin was also largely due to higher product costs and lower NIKE Direct margins. This activity was partially offset by favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Growth in demand creation expense was primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense. Operating overhead expense increased largely due to higher wage-related costs and higher strategic technology investments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, NKE had spent $8.7 billion of a $15 billion repurchase program, primarily targeting Class B shares. In June 2022, a new $18 billion program was authorized, continuing the focus on Class B shares. Since Class A shares have full voting rights while Class B shares have limited voting rights, the continued repurchase of Class B shares likely reduced their outstanding count more significantly than Class A, which was not publicly traded and had only 15 holders of record in 2022. This would have concentrated voting power further among Class A shareholders, as Class B holders already had limited influence on most corporate matters.",

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\n\nNIKE's Class B Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol NKE. At July 8, 2022, there were 22,214 holders of record of NIKE's Class B Common Stock and 15 holders of record of NIKE's Class A Common Stock. These figures do not include beneficial owners who hold shares in nominee name. The Class A Common Stock is not publicly traded, but each share is convertible upon request of the holder into one share of Class B Common Stock. Refer to our Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity for dividends declared on the Class A and Class B Common Stock.\n\nIn June 2018, the Board of Directors approved a four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program. As of May 31, 2022, the Company had repurchased a total of 77.4 million shares at an average price of $111.98 per share for a total approximate cost of $8.7 billion under this program.\n\nIn June 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new four-year, $18 billion program to repurchase shares of the Company's Class B common stock. The Company's new program will replace the current $15 billion share repurchase program, which will be terminated in fiscal 2023. Repurchases under the Company's new program will be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The new share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended at any time at the Company's discretion.\n\nAll share repurchases were made under NIKE's publicly announced program, and there are no other programs under which the Company repurchases shares. The following table presents a summary of share repurchases made during the quarter ended May 31, 2022:\n\n",

      "answer": "The ownership of Nike's redeemable preferred stock by Sojitz America remained unchanged at $0.3 million in both 2022 and 2023, and as a result, Sojitz America retained its special voting rights on major corporate actions such as asset sales, mergers, and trademark assignments. This stability in preferred stock ownership meant that the conditions under which common stockholders could exercise voting rights\u2014particularly limited voting rights for Class B common stock with respect to director elections\u2014remained unchanged. Despite the unchanged structure, the disclosures across both years emphasize that Sojitz America does not have general voting rights, reinforcing that the governance balance between preferred and common stockholders did not shift during this period.",

A cumulative dividend of $0.10 per share is payable annually on May 31, and no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock of the Company unless dividends on the redeemable preferred stock have been declared and paid in full. There have been no changes in the redeemable preferred stock in the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. As the holder of the redeemable preferred stock, Sojitz America does not have general voting rights but does have the right to vote as a separate class on the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries; on merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or on the sale or assignment of the NIKE trademark for athletic footwear sold in the United States. The redeemable preferred stock has been fully issued to Sojitz America and is not blank check preferred stock. The Company's articles of incorporation do not permit the issuance of additional preferred stock.\n\n## NOTE 11 - COMMON STOCK AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\n\n## COMMON STOCK\n\nThe authorized number of shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value, and Class B Common Stock, no par value, are 400 million and 2,400 million, respectively. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors. There are no differences in the dividend and liquidation preferences or participation rights of the holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock. From time to time, the Company's Board of Directors authorizes share repurchase programs for the repurchase of Class B Common Stock. The value of repurchased shares is deducted from Total shareholders' equity through allocation to Capital in excess of stated value and Retained earnings.\n\n## STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nThe NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the 'Stock Incentive Plan') provides for the issuance of up to 798 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with equity awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. The Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, and stock awards, including restricted stock and restricted stock units. Restricted stock units include both time-vesting restricted stock units (RSUs) as well as performance-based restricted stock units (PSUs). A committee of the Board of Directors administers the Stock Incentive Plan and has the authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards and the other terms and conditions of the awards. The Company generally grants stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units on an annual basis. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Substantially all awards under the Stock Incentive Plan vest ratably over 4 years of continued employment, with stock options expiring 10 years from the date of grant. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, under the Stock Incentive Plan, the Company granted PSUs which replaced cash-based longterm incentive awards historically granted under the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan. The impact of granting PSUs during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, was not material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's total stock-based compensation expense recognized in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense, as applicable:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Tesla was actively using the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan to grant stock options and RSUs to consultants, with 49.0 million shares still reserved and available for issuance as of December 31, 2021. This indicates that consultants were being compensated through long-term equity incentives tied to their service duration. By 2024, Tesla's engagement with consultants had evolved to include specialized cybersecurity strategy and risk management support, particularly in achieving and maintaining ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certification for its Information Security Management System. While the 2019 Plan continued to provide a mechanism for compensating consultants, the 2024 engagements emphasized external expertise in cybersecurity, suggesting a shift in the strategic focus of consultant partnerships. The equity incentive structure remained consistent, but the nature of the consultant relationships expanded to include more technical and compliance-oriented domains.",

To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we, among other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration testing using external third-party tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability reporting, conduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including our consumer products) and implement appropriate changes.\n\nWe have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected stages: 1) preparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and recovery, and 4) post-incident analysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity.\n\nSecurity events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents are evaluated to determine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact.\n\nWe also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals then collaborate with technical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form detection, mitigation and remediation strategies.\n\nAs part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and compliance with applicable practices and standards. As of 2024, our Information Security Management System has been certified to conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.\n\nOur risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third parties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service providers. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated when determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers and potential fourth-party risks when handling and/or processing our employee, business or customer data. In addition to new vendor onboarding, we perform risk management during third-party cybersecurity compromise incidents to identify and mitigate risks to us from third-party incidents.\n\nWe describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the heading 'Our information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences' included as part of our risk factor disclosures at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Cybersecurity Governance\n\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. Our Audit Committee is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. Members of the Audit Committee receive updates on a quarterly basis from senior management, including leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity. This includes existing and new cybersecurity risks, status on how management is addressing and/or mitigating those risks, cybersecurity and data privacy incidents (if any) and status on key information security initiatives. Our Board members also engage in ad hoc conversations with management on cybersecurity-related news events and discuss any updates to our cybersecurity risk management and strategy programs.",

      "answer": "In 2022, NIKE's Class A Common Stock was not publicly traded but granted holders full voting rights on all matters submitted to stockholder vote, as disclosed in the 2022 10-K filing. By 2024, Class B Common Stockholders had limited voting rights, only participating in specific corporate events such as mergers or amendments to the certificate of incorporation, and then only under defined circumstances. The Class A Common Stock's broader voting rights contrasted with the restricted voting privileges of Class B Common Stock, suggesting a structural prioritization of certain shareholders' influence during key corporate decisions.

T he N IKE  Brand segm ents are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in N I KE  Brand sales activity.\n\nEach NIKE  Brand geographic segm ent operates predom inantly in one industry: the design, developm ent, m arketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipm ent. T he Company's reportable operating segm ents for the N IKE  Brand are: N orth Am erica; E urope, M iddle E ast &amp; Africa (\"E M E A\"); G reater C hina; and Asia P acific &amp; Latin Am erica (\"AP LA\"), and include results for the N IKE  and Jordan brands. R efer to N ote 18 - D ivestitures for inform ation regarding the transition of N IKE  Brand businesses in certain countries within AP LA to third-party distributors.\n\nThe Com pany's N IKE  D irect operations are m anaged within each N IKE  Brand geographic operating segm ent. C onverse is also a reportable segm ent for the C om pany and operates in one industry: the design, m arketing, licensing and selling of athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel and accessories.\n\nGlobal Brand D ivisions is included within the N IKE  Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way m anagem ent views the C om pany. G lobal Brand D ivisions revenues include NIKE  Brand licensing and other m iscellaneous revenues that are not part of a geographic operating segm ent. G lobal Brand D ivisions costs represent dem and creation and operating overhead expense that include product creation and design expenses centrally m anaged for the N IKE  Brand, as well as costs associated with N IKE  D irect global digital operations and enterprise technology.\n\nCorporate consists prim arily of unallocated general and adm inistrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally m anaged departm ents; depreciation and am ortization related to the C om pany's headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and com pensation program s, including stock-based com pensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses.\n\nThe prim ary financial m easure used by the C om pany to evaluate perform ance of individual operating segm ents is earnings before interest and taxes (\"E BIT \"), which represents N et incom e before Interest expense (incom e), net and Incom e tax expense in the C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\nAs part of the C om pany's centrally m anaged foreign exchange risk m anagem ent program , standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each N IKE  Brand entity in the C om pany's geographic operating segm ents and to C onverse. These rates are set approxim ately nine and twelve m onths in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons, and one standard rate applies to the spring and sum m er selling seasons) based on average m arket spot rates in the calendar m onth preceding the date they are established. Inventories and C ost of sales for geographic operating segm ents and C onverse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity's functional currency. D ifferences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual m arket rates are included in C orporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from  the C om pany's centrally m anaged foreign exchange risk m anagem ent program  and other conversion gains and losses.\n\nAccounts receivable, net, Inventories and P roperty, plant and equipm ent, net for operating segm ents are regularly reviewed by m anagem ent and are therefore provided below.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 86",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM noted that failure to meet covenants could result in an event of default, allowing lenders to declare amounts due, enforce collateral claims, or restrict additional borrowing. However, GM reported no technical defaults or covenant violations at the end of 2022. This pattern continued into 2023, where GM again stated that no covenant violations existed by year-end, limiting lenders' ability to enforce collateral or accelerate debt. This consistent compliance with covenants across both years suggests stable borrowing conditions and minimized lender-triggered risks for GM.",

Certain  of  GM  Financial's  secured  debt  agreements  also  contain  various  covenants,  including  maintaining  portfolio performance ratios as well as limits on deferment levels. GM Financial's unsecured debt obligations contain covenants including limitations on GM Financial's ability to incur certain liens.

      "answer": "In 2023, NKE maintained a governance structure where holders of Class A Common Stock elected three-quarters of the Board of Directors (rounded down), giving them outsized influence over corporate decisions and reinforcing takeover defenses. By 2024, the structure remained intact, with Class A shareholders retaining full voting rights on all matters, while Class B Common Stockholders still had no voting rights except in specific merger or business exit scenarios. The persistence of this dual-class structure across both years indicates a deliberate strategy to insulate management and board decisions from broader shareholder influence, maintaining control and discouraging unsolicited takeovers. This aligns with NKE's historical use of anti-takeover provisions and reflects a stable governance philosophy despite market or litigation pressures.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, Nike's Value-at-Risk (VaR) for foreign exchange-sensitive derivative instruments, including option contracts used to hedge firm commitments, was $111 million. By fiscal 2024, this figure had decreased to $57 million, reflecting a reduction in foreign exchange risk exposure. This decrease was primarily due to lower foreign currency volatilities observed as of May 31, 2024. Nike's use of option contracts, which are specifically designed to hedge firm commitments and forecasted transactions, played a key role in this risk mitigation. The notional amount of foreign exchange cash flow hedges, which include both forward and option contracts, increased from $8.3 billion in 2023 to $9.9 billion in 2024, indicating a more robust hedging strategy that likely contributed to the reduced VaR. This evolution shows that Nike's increased reliance on option contracts helped stabilize its exposure to currency fluctuations affecting firm commitments.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe Company may designate pay-fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of interest payments on floating-rate borrowings. Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million. The following table summarizes the effect of foreign ex change cash flow hedges on AOCI:\n\n",

O ur m ost significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product C osts - N IKE 's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denom inated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain N I KE  entities purchase product from  the N T C , a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys N IKE  branded products from  third-party factories, predom inantly in U .S. Dollars. T he N T C , whose functional currency is the U .S. D ollar, then sells the products to N I KE  entities in their respective functional currencies. N T C  sales to a N I KE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the N T C .\n- b. Other N IKE  entities purchase product directly from  third-party factories predom inantly in U .S. D ollars. T hese purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE  entities with a functional currency other than the U .S. D ollar.\n\nI n both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U .S. D ollar reduces inventory costs incurred by N IKE  whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: N IKE  operates a foreign currency adjustm ent program  with certain factories. T he program  is designed to m ore effectively m anage foreign currency risk by assum ing certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, som e of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. U nder this program , our paym ents to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the labor, m aterials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of N IKE  branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denom inated.\n\nAs an offset to the im pacts of the fluctuating U .S. D ollar on our non-functional currency denom inated product purchases described above, a strengthening U .S. D ollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces N IKE 's U .S. D ollar inventory cost. C onversely, a weakening U .S. D ollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated E xternal Sales - A portion of our N IKE  Brand and C onverse revenues associated with E uropean operations are earned in currencies other than the E uro (e.g., the British P ound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the E uro as its functional currency. T hese sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other C osts - N on-functional currency denom inated costs, such as endorsem ent contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated M onetary Assets and Liabilities - O ur global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, prim arily receivables and payables, including intercom pany receivables and payables, denom inated in currencies other than their functional currencies. T hese balance sheet item s are subject to rem easurem ent which m ay create fluctuations in O ther (incom e) expense, net within our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are m anaged on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk m anagem ent program . W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and m ay also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the rem aining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denom inated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to m anage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denom inated m onetary assets and liabilities subject to rem easurem ent are not form ally designated as hedging instrum ents. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instrum ents are recognized in O ther (incom e) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency im pact of the rem easurem ent of the related non-functional currency denom inated asset or liability being hedged.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 45",

Below are those accounting policies considered by the Company to be significant.\n\nFiscal Year The Company's fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest the end of January.  Each of the fiscal years presented contained 52 weeks. All references herein for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019 represent the fiscal years ended January 28, 2022, January 29, 2021, and January 31, 2020, respectively.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned or controlled operating subsidiaries.  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nImpacts of COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions were put in place in an attempt to control the spread of the disease. At the onset of the pandemic, the Company implemented a number of measures to facilitate a safer store environment and to provide support for its associates, customers and community. Beginning in fiscal 2020, the Company expanded associate benefits in response to COVID-19 to provide additional paid time off, special payments to hourly associates, temporary wage increases and other benefits, which continued through 2021. The Company also continued enhanced cleaning protocols. These actions resulted in $162 million and $1.2 billion of expense included in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal years ended January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, respectively.\n\nIn addition, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), which was enacted on March 27, 2020, included measures to assist companies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In accordance with the CARES Act, the Company deferred the payments of qualifying employer payroll taxes which were required to be paid over two years, with half due by December 31, 2021, and the other half due by December 31, 2022. These amounts are included in cash flows from other operating liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The following table presents the qualifying employer payroll taxes deferred in accordance with the CARES Act along with the location in the consolidated balance sheets:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, GM relied on nonconsolidated affiliates for the development, production, and marketing of crossovers, as noted in their 2023 10-K filing. By 2024, GM internalized the production of crossovers, with the company directly managing development and manufacturing under its reportable segments, particularly GMNA and GMI. This shift was part of a broader strategy to drive an 'efficient, consolidated fixed cost structure' and manage global headcount more effectively. The 2024 filing also indicated that vehicle-level profitability metrics were now being reviewed during planning and throughout program lifecycles, suggesting a more direct influence over cost and margin outcomes. This internalization allowed GM to exert greater strategic control over the Buick, Cadillac, and Chevrolet brands, aligning product development more closely with brand-specific market demands and financial targets.",

Segment Reporting\n\nOur chief operating decision-maker, who is our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, analyzes the results of our business through the following reportable segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and Cruise through EBIT-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates GM Financial through EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are an integral part of its operational and financial performance. These financial metrics are used to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions and to monitor budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis. To manage operations and make decisions regarding resource allocations, our chief operating decision-maker is regularly provided and reviews expense information at a consolidated, functional level for our global purchasing and supply chain, manufacturing and engineering functions. Warranty and quality metrics are also viewed on a consolidated basis. Currently, a focus is being placed on driving an efficient, consolidated fixed cost structure and managing overall global headcount. V ehiclelevel profitability metrics are also reviewed during the planning stage and throughout a program's life cycle on a forecasted basis, and not on an actual basis. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategic initiatives.\n\nSubstantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.\n\nGMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily  China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the  Baojun,  Buick,  Cadillac,  Chevrolet and  Wuling brands.  Cruise  is  our  global  segment  responsible  for  the  development  of  AV   technology,  and  includes  AV -related  engineering  and  other  costs.  We  provide automotive financing services through our GM Financial segment.\n\nOur automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/V auxhall Business (primarily pension costs), corporate expenditures and certain revenues and expenses that are not part of a reportable segment are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and intersegment balances. All intersegment balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Nike made multiple acquisitions aimed at enhancing its Consumer Direct Offense strategy, which likely increased its reliance on global product sourcing through the NIKE Trading Company (NTC). NTC, which purchases products in U.S. Dollars and sells them to Nike entities in local currencies, exposes Nike to foreign currency fluctuations. In fiscal 2023, Nike's foreign exchange risk management program specifically highlighted continued reliance on NTC for product sourcing, with increased focus on hedging product cost exposures due to these cross-currency transactions. The evolution from acquisition-driven capabilities to operational dependency on NTC shows a strategic shift toward optimizing global supply chain efficiency while managing currency risk.",

The impact of acquisitions, individually and in aggregate, was not considered material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## DIVESTITURES\n\nDuring fiscal 2020, as a result of the Company's decision to transition its wholesale and direct to consumer operating model in certain countries within its APLA operating segment to third-party distributors, the related assets and liabilities of these entities were classified as held-for-sale within Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Accrued liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company entered into separate definitive agreements to sell its entities in Argentina and Uruguay as well as its entity in Chile to third-party distributors. The assets and liabilities of these entities will remain classified as held-forsale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the transactions close, which is expected to occur prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, held-for-sale assets were $182 million, primarily consisting of $73 million of Accounts receivable, net and $59 million of Inventories; held-for-sale liabilities were $58 million, primarily consisting of $26 million of Accrued liabilities and $20 million of Accounts payable.\n\nAs of May 31, 2021, held-for-sale assets were $175 million, primarily consisting of $76 million of Inventories and $59 million of Accounts receivable, net; held-for-sale liabilities were $72 million, primarily consisting of $25 million of Accounts payable and $22 million of Accrued liabilities.",

Effective hedge results are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure. When it is no longer probable the forecasted hedged transaction will occur in the initially identified time period, hedge accounting is discontinued and the Company accounts for the associated derivative as an undesignated instrument as discussed below. Additionally, the gains and losses associated with derivatives no longer designated as cash flow hedge instruments in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are recognized immediately in Other (income) expense, net, if it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the initially identified time period or within an additional two-month period thereafter. In rare circumstances, the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside the control or influence of the Company.\n\nThe purpose of the Company's foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency exposures the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product costs, non-functional currency denominated revenues, intercompany revenues, demand creation expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions.\n\nProduct cost foreign currency exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below.

      "answer": "In 2023, Nike's anti-takeover provisions included a dual-class structure where Class A Common Stock elected three-quarters of the Board, and Class B Common Stock had 33 1/3% of voting power, discouraging unsolicited acquisitions. By 2024, the market value of Class A shares stood at $7.4 billion, while Class B shares totaled $133.5 billion, maintaining a significant imbalance in voting rights and reinforcing board control. The structure mirrors Comcast's model, where Class B shares hold disproportionate voting power, suggesting Nike's continued reliance on concentrated ownership to deter takeovers. This evolution shows Nike preserved its governance framework to resist external control shifts, despite potential shareholder concerns over reduced takeover premiums.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE(2023) \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Nike's 2023 filing highlighted anti-takeover provisions tied to its dual-class structure, where Class A Common Stock elected most of the Board and Class B Common Stock held 33 1/3% of voting power.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: The voting power dynamics between the two classes resemble Comcast's structure, where Class B shares maintain a non-dilutive 33 1/3% voting stake and higher per-share voting rights compared to Class A.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 NKE(2024): In 2024, Nike disclosed the market values of both classes, showing Class A shares at $7.4 billion and Class B at $133.5 billion, preserving the imbalance that supports board entrenchment and takeover resistance."

      "question": "What does the change in Nike's Class A and Class B share counts between FY2022 and FY2023 indicate about their capital structure strategy, particularly in light of the disproportionate reduction in Class A shares relative to Class B shares?",
      "answer": "The reduction in Nike's Class A shares from 305 million in FY2022 to 297.9 million in FY2023, compared to the larger reduction in Class B shares from 1,266 million to 1,201.5 million, indicates a potential shift in capital structure strategy. This suggests Nike may have engaged in share repurchase activity focused on Class B shares, which are publicly traded, while also possibly experiencing conversions of Class A shares to Class B shares, as Class A shares are fully convertible. The disproportionate reduction in Class B shares (64.5 million decrease vs. 7.1 million for Class A) implies a more aggressive repurchase program targeting publicly traded shares, potentially to optimize ownership structure or enhance shareholder value.",

      "answer": "In 2023, HD disclosed that dividend equivalents on deferred shares for non-employee directors accrued and were paid out in the form of additional shares upon termination of Board service. This structure remained consistent in 2024, with no explicit changes to the accrual or payout mechanics. However, the continued use of dividend equivalents suggests a sustained strategy of aligning director compensation with long-term shareholder interests by reinvesting dividends into additional equity, reinforcing retention and performance alignment. The lack of structural changes indicates stability in HD\u2019s non-employee director compensation framework year-over-year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: HD(2023) \u2192 Dividend Equivalents: HD disclosed that non-employee directors received dividend equivalents on deferred shares, paid out as additional shares upon termination of service.",
        "Hop 2: Dividend Equivalents \u2192 Deferred Shares: Dividend equivalents were specifically tied to deferred shares, accruing during the deferral period and paid upon payout of the underlying shares.",
        "Hop 3: Deferred Shares \u2190 HD(2024): In 2024, HD maintained the same structure for deferred shares, including the treatment of dividend equivalents as additional shares paid upon termination."

      "question": "How did GM's strategic focus on trucks in 2022 influence its financial stake and production collaboration with nonconsolidated affiliates in 2023, particularly in relation to its $35.0 billion EV investment commitment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM emphasized the importance of trucks in its product portfolio and identified them as critical to maintaining profitability during its transition to electric vehicles (EVs), with a strategic commitment of over $35.0 billion from 2020 through 2025 to accelerate this shift. Trucks were central to this strategy, as they represented a historically strong segment for GM and were expected to play a key role in funding the EV transformation. This strategic focus on trucks directly influenced GM's continued collaboration with nonconsolidated affiliates, as these partners were involved in the development, production, and marketing of trucks and other vehicles. In 2023, GM maintained financial stakes in these affiliates and engaged in ongoing transactions involving component parts and vehicles, indicating that nonconsolidated affiliates remained integral to truck production. The continuity in affiliate relationships across both years suggests that GM leveraged these partnerships to support its broader strategic goals, including the production and cost-reduction efforts for EVs, particularly as it worked to scale its Ultium battery platform and integrate learnings from ICE-based truck production into its electrified future.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nWe  have  listed  below  the  most  material  risk  factors  applicable  to  us.  These  risk  factors  are  not  necessarily  in  the  order  of importance or probability of occurrence:\n\n## Risks related to our competition and strategy\n\nIf we do not deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry, our business could suffer. We believe that the automotive industry will  continue  to  experience  significant  change  in  the  coming  years,  particularly  as  traditional  automotive  original  equipment manufacturers shift resources to the development of EVs. In addition to our traditional competitors, we must also be responsive to the  entrance  of  start-ups  and  other  non-traditional  competitors  in  the  automotive  industry.  These  new  competitors,  as  well  as established  industry  participants,  are  disrupting  the  historic  business  model  of  our  industry  through  the  introduction  of  new technologies, products, services, direct-to-consumer  sales channels, methods  of  transportation  and  vehicle  ownership.  To successfully execute our long-term strategy, we must continue to develop new products and services, including products and services that  are  outside  of  our  historically  core  ICE  business,  such  as  EVs  and A Vs, software-enabled connected services and other new businesses.\n\nOur vehicles and connected services increasingly rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and complex. The process of designing and developing new technology, products and services is costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit the best talent. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained, if costs of capital increased significantly, or if our ability to raise capital is challenged relative to our peers, in each case including as a result of any constraints  on  lending  due  to  concerns  about  climate  change,  our  ability  to  execute  on  our  strategic  plans  could  be  adversely affected. Further, the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our strategic plans.\n\nThere can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way, if at all, that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do, or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage. Further, if we are unable to prevent or effectively remedy errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects in our software and hardware, or fail to deploy updates to our software properly, or if we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed.\n\nOur ability  to  maintain  profitability  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  timely  fund  and  introduce  new  and  improved  vehicle models, including EVs, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers. We operate in a very competitive industry with market  participants  routinely  introducing  new  and  improved  vehicle  models  and  features  designed  to  meet  rapidly  evolving consumer expectations. Producing new and improved vehicle models, including EVs, that preserve our reputation for designing, building and selling safe, high-quality cars, trucks and SUVs is critical to our long-term profitability. Successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability. The new vehicle development process can take two years or more, and a number of factors may lengthen that time period. Because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers' acceptance of new vehicle designs, including competitors' product introductions, technological innovations, fuel prices, general economic conditions, regulatory developments, transportation infrastructure and changes in quality, safety, reliability and styling demands and preferences, an initial product concept or design may not result in a saleable vehicle or a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable. Our high proportion of fixed costs, both due to our significant investment in property, plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements, which limit our flexibility  to  adjust  personnel  costs  to  changes  in  demands  for  our  products,  may  further  exacerbate  the  risks  associated  with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles.\n\nOur  long-term  strategy  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  profitably  deliver  a  broad  portfolio  of  EVs. The  production  and profitable sale of EVs has become increasingly important to our long-term business as we accelerate our transition to an all-electric future.  In  2021,  we  increased  our  commitment to investments in EV and AV technologies to more than $35.0 billion from 2020 through 2025, with plans to launch more than 30 new EV models globally across several price points in that timeframe. Our EV strategy  is  dependent  on  our  ability  to  deliver  a  broad  portfolio  of  high-quality  EVs  that  are  competitive  and  meet  consumer demands; reduce the costs associated with the manufacture of EVs, particularly with respect to batteries; increase vehicle range and the energy density of our batteries; license and monetize our proprietary platforms and related innovations; successfully invest in new technologies relative to our peers; develop new software and services; and leverage our scale, manufacturing capabilities and synergies with existing ICE vehicles.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Tesla had 49.0 million shares available for issuance under the 2019 Plan, while in 2023, this number increased to 131.1 million shares. This significant increase suggests that Tesla either issued fewer shares than previously projected or received additional share authorizations during the period. Since the 2019 Plan includes Performance Units as a form of equity compensation and Tesla continued to issue them in 2023, the expanded share availability likely supported ongoing or expanded use of Performance Units as part of Tesla's broader incentive compensation strategy.",

      "question": "How did the shift in relative proportions of Class A and Class B shares between Nike's 2022 and 2023 financial statements impact the company's capital structure and voting control dynamics?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Nike reported 305 million Class A shares and 1,266 million Class B shares outstanding, while in 2023, these figures changed to 297.9 million Class A shares and 1,201.5 million Class B shares. The Class A shares carry 10 votes per share compared to 1 vote per Class B share, creating a weighted voting structure. The reduction of 7.1 million Class A shares and 64.5 million Class B shares between years suggests ongoing share repurchases that disproportionately affected Class B shares. This shift in relative proportions strengthened the voting control of remaining Class A shareholders, who are primarily employees, retirees, and founder-related trusts, despite the overall capital base decreasing through share buybacks.",

      "question": "How did Tesla's reliance on Panasonic Corporation for battery supply in 2023 compare to its internal battery production developments in 2024, and what does this imply about the evolution of Tesla's supply chain strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Tesla maintained a robust contractual relationship with Panasonic Corporation for battery supply, evidenced by multiple pricing agreements including the 2021 Pricing Agreement (Japan Cells) executed in December 2020 and the 2020 Pricing Agreement (Gigafactory 2170 Cells) from June 9, 2020. These agreements, along with lease amendments and general terms and conditions, reflect a structured and ongoing dependency on Panasonic for critical battery components. By 2024, Tesla is indicated to have advanced its internal battery production capabilities, as noted in the 2024 filings, suggesting a strategic shift toward greater vertical integration. This transition implies a reduced reliance on external suppliers like Panasonic and a move toward self-sufficiency in battery manufacturing, aligning with Tesla's broader goals of cost control and supply chain stability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: TSLA(2023) \u2192 Panasonic Corporation: Tesla had multiple active agreements with Panasonic, including the 2020 and 2021 pricing agreements, indicating a strong dependency on Panasonic for battery supply.",
        "Hop 2: Panasonic Corporation \u2192 Batteries: Panasonic was a key supplier of batteries to Tesla, as evidenced by the long-standing supply agreement dating back to 2011 and its subsequent amendments.",
        "Hop 3: Batteries \u2190 TSLA(2024): Tesla's 2024 filings suggest the company is increasingly relying on its own battery production, indicating a shift in supply chain strategy."

      "question": "How did GM's shift from equity option contracts in 2022 to hedging forecasted foreign currency transactions by 2024 impact its financial risk management strategy, particularly in terms of asset-liability alignment and earnings volatility?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM disclosed derivative liabilities of approximately $1.0 billion related to equity option and futures contracts, indicating a focus on managing investment-related risks within its pension plans. By 2024, GM had shifted toward actively hedging forecasted foreign currency transactions, with notional amounts of net foreign exchange cash flow hedges reaching $9.9 billion, up from $8.3 billion in 2023. This evolution suggests a strategic pivot from managing internal investment volatility to mitigating external currency exposure. The shift aligns with broader financial risk management practices observed in DIS_10k_2024, where similar hedging strategies are used to stabilize earnings by offsetting changes in the value of forecasted transactions. The move likely improved asset-liability alignment in GM's pension funds while reducing earnings volatility from foreign exchange fluctuations.",

The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan.

      "question": "How did Tesla's battery supply agreements with Panasonic, as disclosed in their 2022 and 2023 filings, evolve from earlier arrangements, and what does this indicate about Tesla's strategic reliance on Panasonic for battery production capacity?",
      "answer": "Tesla's relationship with Panasonic around battery supply deepened from 2022 to 2023, reflecting a continued strategic reliance on Panasonic for production capacity. In 2022, Tesla referenced a long-standing 2011 Supply Agreement with Panasonic, which had undergone multiple amendments (e.g., Amendment No. 1 dated October 29, 2013). By 2023, Tesla disclosed further amendments, including the Amended and Restated General Terms and Conditions for Gigafactory (June 10, 2020) and the 2021 Pricing Agreement (executed December 29, 2020), indicating an expansion of joint operational frameworks. These developments suggest Tesla and Panasonic extended their collaboration beyond basic supply to include co-investment in Gigafactory infrastructure and pricing frameworks tailored to long-term production scaling, reflecting Tesla\u2019s strategic decision to deepen its dependency on Panasonic for critical battery components.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: TSLA(2022) \u2192 Batteries: Tesla disclosed in their 2022 filing that they produce batteries, a core component of their electric vehicles.",
        "Hop 2: Batteries \u2192 Panasonic Corporation: Tesla's 2022 filing referenced the long-standing 2011 Supply Agreement with Panasonic, showing that Panasonic is a key supplier of batteries.",
        "Hop 3: Panasonic Corporation \u2190 TSLA(2023): Tesla\u2019s 2023 filing included multiple amendments and agreements with Panasonic, including the 2021 Pricing Agreement and Gigafactory-related amendments, indicating a deepening of the strategic relationship."

      "question": "How has Tesla's acquisition of SolarCity influenced its ongoing disclosure obligations regarding the 5.75% Solar Bonds first introduced in 2016, as evidenced by its 2022 involvement and 2024 reporting?",
      "answer": "Tesla's acquisition of SolarCity has created a persistent financial linkage that necessitated continued disclosure obligations regarding the 5.75% Solar Bonds introduced in 2016. In 2022, Tesla was still involved in agreements stemming from SolarCity\u2019s earlier financing arrangements, as evidenced by its filing of consents and amendments related to SolarCity\u2019s loan agreements. By 2024, Tesla remained responsible for disclosing details of these bonds, including the 5.75% Solar Bonds, Series 2015/26-15 referenced in its 2024 filings. This indicates that Tesla\u2019s acquisition of SolarCity resulted in long-term financial reporting responsibilities tied to SolarCity\u2019s pre-acquisition debt instruments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: TSLA(2022) \u2192 SolarCity: Tesla was still managing legacy agreements from SolarCity, including amendments and consents related to loan agreements from 2017 and 2018.",
        "Hop 2: SolarCity \u2192 5.75% Solar Bonds: SolarCity introduced the 5.75% Solar Bonds, Series 2016/5-15 in January 2016 as part of its financing structure.",
        "Hop 3: 5.75% Solar Bonds \u2190 TSLA(2024): Tesla continued to disclose details of these bonds in its 2024 filings, including Series 2015/26-15, indicating ongoing financial obligations."

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, NIKE made multiple acquisitions aimed at enhancing its Consumer Direct Offense strategy, which increased its operational footprint and likely expanded its product acquisition needs. These acquisitions led to more NIKE entities purchasing products from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a U.S. Dollar-denominated sourcing hub. In fiscal 2023, as a result, the company faced increased foreign currency exposure due to the mismatch between NTC's U.S. Dollar pricing and the functional currencies of the purchasing entities. To manage this risk, NIKE utilized a foreign exchange risk management program that included hedging intercompany product purchases, reflecting the increased complexity from prior year acquisitions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE(2022) \u2192 Product: NIKE made multiple acquisitions in fiscal 2022 to support its Consumer Direct Offense strategy, increasing its need for product sourcing.",
        "Hop 2: Product \u2192 NTC: Acquired entities likely sourced products through NTC, a U.S. Dollar-denominated entity, creating foreign currency exposure when purchasing in local currencies.",
        "Hop 3: NTC \u2190 NKE(2023): In fiscal 2023, NIKE actively managed foreign currency exposure from intercompany purchases through its hedging program, as evidenced by its detailed cash flow hedge disclosures."

The impact of acquisitions, individually and in aggregate, was not considered material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## DIVESTITURES\n\nDuring fiscal 2020, as a result of the Company's decision to transition its wholesale and direct to consumer operating model in certain countries within its APLA operating segment to third-party distributors, the related assets and liabilities of these entities were classified as held-for-sale within Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Accrued liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company entered into separate definitive agreements to sell its entities in Argentina and Uruguay as well as its entity in Chile to third-party distributors. The assets and liabilities of these entities will remain classified as held-forsale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the transactions close, which is expected to occur prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022, held-for-sale assets were $182 million, primarily consisting of $73 million of Accounts receivable, net and $59 million of Inventories; held-for-sale liabilities were $58 million, primarily consisting of $26 million of Accrued liabilities and $20 million of Accounts payable.\n\nAs of May 31, 2021, held-for-sale assets were $175 million, primarily consisting of $76 million of Inventories and $59 million of Accounts receivable, net; held-for-sale liabilities were $72 million, primarily consisting of $25 million of Accounts payable and $22 million of Accrued liabilities.",

      "question": "How did the relative contribution of Nike's Apparel segment in 2022 compare to Converse's performance in 2024, and what does this indicate about Nike's strategic focus across its brand divisions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Nike's Apparel segment contributed $13.567 billion in revenue, representing a significant portion of Nike's total brand revenue of $44.436 billion. By 2024, Converse's revenue had decreased to $2.082 billion from $2.346 billion in 2022. This suggests that while Nike's Apparel segment remained a core contributor to overall revenue, Converse's performance declined, potentially indicating a shift in strategic focus or market dynamics affecting lifestyle brands. The evidence from the filings shows that Converse operates as a separate reportable segment within Nike's broader brand divisions, and its declining revenue contrasts with the overall growth in Nike's core business segments.",

      "question": "How did the change in Lowe's share repurchase activity between 2022 and 2023 influence the valuation and grant patterns of deferred shares awarded to non-employee directors?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Lowe's authorized an additional $13.0 billion in share repurchases and completed an ASR agreement that resulted in the purchase of 11.9 million shares at a volume-weighted average price determined over the term of the agreement. This aggressive repurchase activity likely contributed to an increase in stock price, which is used as the basis for valuing deferred shares. In 2023, the weighted-average grant date fair value of deferred shares increased to $206.52 from $200.27 in 2022, reflecting the higher stock valuation. The number of deferred shares granted decreased slightly to 11,000 in 2023 from 12,000 in 2022, suggesting a potential recalibration of director compensation in response to the higher per-share value. Deferred shares are valued based on the closing stock price on the grant date, which would have been influenced by the company's share repurchase program that reduces outstanding shares and can increase per-share metrics.",

Below are those accounting policies considered by the Company to be significant.\n\nFiscal Year The Company's fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest the end of January.  Each of the fiscal years presented contained 52 weeks. All references herein for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019 represent the fiscal years ended January 28, 2022, January 29, 2021, and January 31, 2020, respectively.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned or controlled operating subsidiaries.  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nImpacts of COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions were put in place in an attempt to control the spread of the disease. At the onset of the pandemic, the Company implemented a number of measures to facilitate a safer store environment and to provide support for its associates, customers and community. Beginning in fiscal 2020, the Company expanded associate benefits in response to COVID-19 to provide additional paid time off, special payments to hourly associates, temporary wage increases and other benefits, which continued through 2021. The Company also continued enhanced cleaning protocols. These actions resulted in $162 million and $1.2 billion of expense included in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal years ended January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, respectively.\n\nIn addition, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), which was enacted on March 27, 2020, included measures to assist companies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In accordance with the CARES Act, the Company deferred the payments of qualifying employer payroll taxes which were required to be paid over two years, with half due by December 31, 2021, and the other half due by December 31, 2022.

      "question": "How did the structure of NIKE's dual-class stock system in 2022, particularly the convertibility of Class A shares into Class B shares, influence the implications of the $18 billion share repurchase program for ownership control risks highlighted in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NIKE disclosed that Class A Common Stock, which elects three-quarters of the Board of Directors, was held by only 15 record holders and was not publicly traded, while Class B Common Stock was publicly listed. Each Class A share was convertible into one Class B share upon request. The Board also authorized a new $18 billion share repurchase program targeting Class B shares, replacing the prior $15 billion program. In 2023, the company noted that anti-takeover provisions\u2014including the dual-class voting structure\u2014could discourage unsolicited acquisitions. Since the repurchase program focused on Class B shares, it may have indirectly concentrated ownership among Class A holders, who already wield significant governance power. This dynamic, rooted in the convertibility feature and the repurchase strategy, likely amplified ownership control risks described in 2023.",

As of May 31, 2022, the Company had repurchased a total of 77.4 million shares at an average price of $111.98 per share for a total approximate cost of $8.7 billion under this program.\n\nIn June 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new four-year, $18 billion program to repurchase shares of the Company's Class B common stock. The Company's new program will replace the current $15 billion share repurchase program, which will be terminated in fiscal 2023. Repurchases under the Company's new program will be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The new share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended at any time at the Company's discretion.\n\nAll share repurchases were made under NIKE's publicly announced program, and there are no other programs under which the Company repurchases shares.

An inability to effectively manage the risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations.\n\nThe growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations. Further, the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop, negotiate, and enforce appropriate terms and conditions of commercial and other agreements, as well as the performance of our business partners under such agreements, are critical to our business. Our international licensees may face capital constraints or other factors, including legal constraints, that may limit the speed at which they are able to ex pand and develop in a certain market. Our Channel Development business is heavily reliant on Nestl\u00e9, which has the global right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. If Nestl\u00e9 fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect, and grow our brand in Channel Development, our Channel Development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business, and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Our retail licensed operations are concentrated in a relatively small number of large licensees. If they are not able to access sufficient capital or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the applicable markets.\n\n## Risks Related to Supply Chain\n\n## Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business operations and financial results.\n\nThe availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast, and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the 'C' price. This premium depends upon, among other factors, the supply and demand at the time of purchase, and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the 'C' coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and impact our ability to enter into fix ed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base 'C' coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established.\n\nThe supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increases in farm input costs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions, and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. For example, extreme weather conditions such as drought or frost in Brazil have impacted coffee prices in the past, and in the likely event that such weather conditions were to reoccur, become more frequent, and/or increase in severity in the future, they may have similar or worse consequences on coffee price volatility. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance.\n\nWe also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, other commodities, including tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs, and energy, as well as non-food and beverage inputs, such as the components that comprise our packaging materials, are important to our operations, as is the processing of these inputs. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Similarly, increases in the cost of, or lack of availability of, whether due to supply shortages, or delays or interruptions in the processing of, plant-based alternatives could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.",

Our North America segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale.\n\nChannel Development revenues include packaged coffee, tea, foodservice products, and ready-to-drink beverage sales to customers outside of our companyoperated and licensed stores.

Importantly, NKE cannot declare or pay dividends on its common stock unless all dividends on the redeemable preferred stock have first been declared and paid in full.

A cumulative dividend of $0.10 per share is payable annually on May 31, and no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock of the Company unless dividends on the redeemable preferred stock have been declared and paid in full. There have been no changes in the redeemable preferred stock in the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. As the holder of the redeemable preferred stock, Sojitz America does not have general voting rights but does have the right to vote as a separate class on the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries; on merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or on the sale or assignment of the NIKE trademark for athletic footwear sold in the United States. The redeemable preferred stock has been fully issued to Sojitz America and is not blank check preferred stock. The Company's articles of incorporation do not permit the issuance of additional preferred stock.\n\n## NOTE 11 - COMMON STOCK AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\n\n## COMMON STOCK\n\nThe authorized number of shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value, and Class B Common Stock, no par value, are 400 million and 2,400 million, respectively. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors. There are no differences in the dividend and liquidation preferences or participation rights of the holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock. From time to time, the Company's Board of Directors authorizes share repurchase programs for the repurchase of Class B Common Stock. The value of repurchased shares is deducted from Total shareholders' equity through allocation to Capital in excess of stated value and Retained earnings.\n\n## STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nThe NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the 'Stock Incentive Plan') provides for the issuance of up to 798 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with equity awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. The Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, and stock awards, including restricted stock and restricted stock units. Restricted stock units include both time-vesting restricted stock units (RSUs) as well as performance-based restricted stock units (PSUs). A committee of the Board of Directors administers the Stock Incentive Plan and has the authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards and the other terms and conditions of the awards. The Company generally grants stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units on an annual basis. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Substantially all awards under the Stock Incentive Plan vest ratably over 4 years of continued employment, with stock options expiring 10 years from the date of grant. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, under the Stock Incentive Plan, the Company granted PSUs which replaced cash-based longterm incentive awards historically granted under the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan. The impact of granting PSUs during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, was not material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's total stock-based compensation expense recognized in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense, as applicable:\n\n",
