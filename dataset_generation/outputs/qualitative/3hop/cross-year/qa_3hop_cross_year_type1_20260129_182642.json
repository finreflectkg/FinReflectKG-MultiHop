      "question": "How did the change in Pratt & Whitney's net program share interest in IAE from 2022 to 2023 reflect the evolution of RTX's strategic collaboration with Japanese Aero Engines Corporation?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Pratt & Whitney held a 61% program share interest in IAE, while in 2023, this interest decreased to 57% after factoring in sub-collaborator shares. This reduction indicates a shift in RTX's strategic positioning within the IAE collaboration, which includes Japanese Aero Engines Corporation (JAEC). The change suggests a recalibration of RTX's involvement in the V2500 engine program, potentially redistributing program economics among the collaborators. This evolution in the RTX \u2192 IAE \u2192 JAEC chain reflects a strategic adjustment in how RTX manages its international aero-engine partnerships.",

By 2024, UPS reported unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion, expected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 2020 - $10.1 billion pre-tax actuarial loss related to benefit obligation:\n\n- Discount Rates ($7.3 billion pre-tax loss): The weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from 3.55% as of December 31, 2019 to 2.87% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decline in U.S. treasury yields that was slightly offset by an increase in credit spreads on AA-rated corporate bonds.\n- Coordinating benefits attributable to the Central States Pension Fund ($2.3 billion pre-tax loss): This represents our current best estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the Central States Pension Fund before taking into account the impact of the change in discount rates.\n- Demographic and Assumption Changes ($513 million pre-tax loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation changes, rates of termination, retirement, mortality and other changes.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Plan Assets\n\nPension assets are invested in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as investment guidelines established by plan trustees. The strategic asset mixes are specifically tailored for each plan given distinct factors, including liability and liquidity needs. Equities, alternative investments, and other higher yielding assets are utilized to generate returns and promote growth. Derivatives, repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements and fixed income securities are utilized as tools for duration management, mitigating interest rate risk, and minimizing funded status volatility.\n\nThe primary long-term investment objectives for pension assets are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital to meet future obligations while minimizing risk exposures and reducing funded status volatility. To meet these objectives, investment managers are engaged to actively manage assets within the guidelines and strategies set forth by the Investment Committee. Active managers are monitored regularly and their performance is compared to applicable benchmarks. As a result of our long-term U.S. investment objectives for pension assets, the weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on assets decreased from 7.77% during 2020 to 6.50% in 2021.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nPlan assets valued utilizing Level 1 inputs include equity investments, corporate debt instruments and U.S. government securities. Fair values were determined by closing prices for those securities traded on national stock exchanges, while securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on the valuation date are valued at the mean between the last reported bid and ask prices.\n\nLevel 2 assets include fixed income securities that are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of other issues with similar credit ratings; mortgage-backed securities that are valued based on cash flow and yield models using acceptable modeling and pricing conventions; and certain investments that are pooled with other investments in a commingled fund. We value our investments in commingled funds by taking the percentage ownership of the underlying assets, each of which has a readily determinable fair value.\n\nFair value estimates for certain investments are based on unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by observable market data and are thus classified as Level 3.\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a net asset value (\"NAV\") or its equivalent developed consistent with FASB measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, risk parity funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds and risk parity funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31st. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two to three month notice period,",

No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

Based on the structure where Class B common stock has 15 votes per share, and Class A voting power is dependent on the total shares outstanding, the relative control of the Class B holders increased slightly as their share of total voting power grew due to the reduction in Class A shares.

      "question": "How did UPS's allocation to private debt investments in 2022 compare with the role of net asset value (NAV) in reporting these investments by 2024, and what does this reveal about their long-term investment strategy in alternative assets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UPS allocated $695 million to private debt, representing 1.3% of U.S. plan assets, indicating a modest but deliberate exposure to alternative investments. By 2024, UPS disclosed that private debt investments were being valued using net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient, reflecting a strategic shift toward more structured and long-term reporting of these illiquid assets. Additionally, as of 2024, UPS had unfunded commitments totaling $2.7 billion expected to be contributed over the next 3\u20136 years, signaling a continued commitment to expanding private debt and other alternative investments. This evolution shows a strategic deepening in UPS\u2019s reliance on NAV-based reporting for private debt, aligning with a broader long-term investment approach in alternative asset classes.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

      "answer": "In 2023, UPS held $9.9 billion in pension and postretirement plan assets invested in real estate funds, which were primarily valued using net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient. These NAV valuations relied on fund manager financial reports and periodic adjustments, making them sensitive to estimation assumptions. In 2024, UPS reported using formal valuation models to assess the sensitivity of financial instruments, including those exposed to market risks like foreign exchange, interest rates, and equity prices. These models assumed instantaneous shifts in market variables and were used to evaluate the fair value impact of such changes. The shift from NAV-based estimation to formal sensitivity modeling suggests UPS adopted a more structured and dynamic approach to valuing complex assets, likely improving transparency and responsiveness to market risk, particularly for long-term investments like real estate funds embedded in pension assets.",

We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with ex posure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in ex change rates, interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non-linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts.\n\nThere are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that foreign currency ex change rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex  market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fix ed and floating interest rate mix  of our interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions. Additionally, changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions.\n\n",

      "question": "How did GD's shift in asset allocation strategy for VEBA trusts between 2022 and 2024 influence the role and responsibilities of the third-party investment manager overseeing those assets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GD's VEBA trusts were primarily invested in publicly traded equities, fixed-income securities, and commingled funds, with the third-party investment manager operating under management oversight and following a general asset allocation strategy that considered funded status and tax implications. By 2024, GD had implemented a more dynamic asset allocation strategy that automatically adjusted investments in liability-hedging assets (primarily commingled fixed-income funds) and return-seeking assets (primarily commingled equity funds) based on funded status thresholds. This required the third-party investment manager to execute more responsive and automated investment decisions aligned with GD\u2019s evolving funded status, particularly as some plans approached full funding. The manager\u2019s responsibilities also expanded to include regular reporting to a Board committee and implementing derivative strategies to manage asset volatility, reflecting a more structured and oversight-intensive relationship compared to 2022.",

        "Hop 3: Third-Party Investment Manager \u2190 GD(2024): By 2024, the third-party manager was executing a more dynamic investment strategy tied to funded status thresholds, with increased oversight from a Board committee and more structured use of derivatives."

This allocation marked a strategic shift where MMM sought to isolate ongoing PFAS exposure to Solventum for post-spin activities, while retaining responsibility only for historical liabilities.

The Company will retain all PFASrelated liabilities resulting from the business, operations, and activities of (x ) the Company's business (as defined in the separation and distribution agreement) and (y) Solventum's business (as defined in the separation and distribution agreement) prior to April 1, 2024. Solventum will retain liability for all PFAS-related liabilities resulting from the business, operations, and activities of its business at or after April 1, 2024, other than liabilities from product claims alleging harm from the presence of PFAS in certain products of Solventum's business sold at or after April 1, 2024, and prior to January 1, 2026 (subject to ex ceptions described in further detail below). The Company will retain liabilities related to site-based PFAS contamination at any real property owned, leased or operated by the Company and liabilities for site-based PFAS contamination arising from third-party claims at sites allocated to the Solventum group in the separation to the extent such liabilities relate to PFAS contamination existing at or prior to April 1, 2024. Solventum assumes PFAS liabilities from the Solventum sites to the extent resulting from an action taken by any member of the Solventum group following April 1, 2024, or from any failure by Solventum following April 1, 2024, to use commercially reasonable efforts that are consistent with then-current industry standards to avoid contamination. The Company will also retain PFAS liabilities for product claims (x) arising from the Company's products, (y) arising from Solventum's products sold prior to April 1, 2024, and (z) arising from certain products sold by Solventum at or after April 1, 2024, and prior to January 1, 2026 (subject to the ex ceptions described below). Clause (z) in the immediately preceding sentence will not ex tend to PFAS liabilities for product claims resulting from (i) new products introduced by Solventum following April 1, 2024, that contain or are enabled by PFAS that is not supplied by the Company, (ii) products that are modified by Solventum after April 1, 2024, to add, contain or become enabled by PFAS that is not supplied by the Company, or with respect to which any modification made after April 1, 2024, in the formulation or production of the product that changes the amount or type of PFAS contained in the product or the amount or type of PFAS enabling the product, in each case from and after the date of such modification, (iii) PFAS that is added to a Solventum product after it is sold by Solventum and (iv) PFAS that has accumulated in or on a Solventum product as a result of the use of the product (whether or not the product is being used as directed), including through filtration, purification or similar application. Solventum will be responsible for the maintenance of certain PFAS containment measures at its properties after the effective time of the distribution. In addition, and consistent with the allocation described above, the Company will retain specifically identified PFAS-related liabilities, including those resulting from specified PFAS-related litigation matters and liabilities under the Company's settlement agreement with public water systems in the United States, as described below.\n\nThe following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated insurance recoveries the Company has recorded relating to its significant legal proceedings.\n\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation: As of December 31, 2024, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately 3,500 individual claimants, compared to approximately 4,042 individual claimants with actions pending December 31, 2023.\n\nThe vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company's mask and respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.\n\nThe Company's current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, is expected to represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. Over the past twenty plus years, the Company has prevailed in nineteen of the twenty cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits described below) and, in the last twelve months, 3M has successfully defended two respirator product liability trials. In February 2024, a jury in Kentucky delivered a defense verdict in favor of 3M, concluding that 3M's 8710 and 8210 respirators that the plaintiff claimed to have used were not defective. In April 2024, another jury in Kentucky returned a defense verdict in 3M's favor and concluded that 3M's 8710 respirator that the plaintiff claimed to have used was not defective.\n\nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company's respiratory protection products. Nonetheless, the Company's litigation experience indicates that claims of persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to litigate and resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it ex perienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWhen making determinations about recording liabilities related to legal proceedings, the Company complies with the requirements of ASC 450, Contingencies, and related guidance, and records liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the loss is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records as an accrual in its financial statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. Based on ex perience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether a loss previously determined to not be reasonably estimable and/or not probable is now able to be reasonably estimated or has become probable. Where appropriate, the Company makes additions to or adjustments of its reasonably estimated losses and/or accruals. As a result, the current accruals and/or estimates of loss and the estimates of the potential impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings, and claims pending against the Company will likely change over time.\n\nBecause litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, the Company may ultimately incur charges substantially in ex cess of presently recorded liabilities, including with respect to matters for which no accruals are currently recorded, because losses are not currently probable and reasonably estimable. Many of the matters described herein are at varying stages, seek an indeterminate amount of damages, or seek damages in amounts that the Company believes are not indicative of the ultimate losses that may be incurred. It is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years. As a matter progresses, the Company may receive information, through plaintiff demands, through discovery, in the form of reports of purported experts, or in the context of settlement or mediation discussions, that purport to quantify an amount of alleged damages, but with which the Company may not agree. Such information may or may not lead the Company to determine that it is able to make a reasonable estimate as to a probable loss or range of loss in connection with a matter. However, even when a loss or range of loss is not probable and reasonably estimable, developments in, or the ultimate resolution of, a matter could be material to the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, future adverse rulings or developments, or settlements in, one or more matters could result in future changes to determinations of probable and reasonably estimable losses in other matters.\n\nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings: The Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of the terms of its numerous policies, including their ex clusions, pertinent case law interpreting comparable policies, its ex perience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and records an amount it has concluded is recognizable and expects to receive in light of the loss recovery and/or gain contingency models under ASC 450, ASC 610-30, and related guidance. For those insured legal proceedings where the Company has recorded an accrued liability in its financial statements, the Company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable from the Company's insurance program. For those insured matters where the Company has not recorded an accrued liability because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, but where the Company has incurred an ex pense in defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable for the expense incurred.\n\nImpact of Solventum Spin-Off : On April 1, 2024, the Company completed the planned spin-off of its Health Care business as an independent company known as Solventum. Concurrent with the spin-off, the Company and Solventum entered into various agreements, including transition agreements and a separation and distribution agreement that, among other things, identified the assets to be transferred, the liabilities to be assumed, indemnification and defense obligations, and the contracts to be transferred to Solventum and 3M as part of the spin-off. In general, and except as noted below and as set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, certain liabilities related to Solventum or the assets that are transferred to Solventum in connection with the spin-off will be retained by or transferred to Solventum. For example, potential liabilities associated with the matters previously described in prior filings under the Bair Hugger and Federal False Claims Act / Qui Tam Litigation sections of this Note 19 have been assumed by Solventum pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, and Solventum will indemnify and defend the Company in these actions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GD disclosed that its pension plan assets included investments in commingled funds, which were valued using net asset value and contained both equity and fixed-income funds. By 2024, GD's 10-K showed that within commingled funds, equity funds had a fair value of $120 million, with $74 million classified as Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets) and $46 million as Level 2 (significant other observable inputs). This reveals a strategic continuation in using commingled structures while showing increased specificity in equity fund allocations. The presence of Level 1 equity funds in 2024 suggests improved transparency or market alignment compared to 2022, where valuation relied more broadly on NAV without such granular disclosure.",

      "answer": "In 2022, LMT's contracts with the U.S. Government were subject to FAR, which dictated that pricing be based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin, ensuring that standalone selling prices aligned with contract terms. By 2024, LMT recovered $1.7 billion in CAS pension costs through U.S. Government contracts, indicating that pension cost recovery was directly tied to FAR-regulated pricing frameworks. The FAR's cost allowability rules and CAS compliance ensured that LMT could allocate and recover pension contributions over time through contract pricing, despite a $990 million cash contribution in 2024. This demonstrates that the FAR's regulatory structure enabled consistent cost recovery mechanisms across years, even as pension funding levels and contract pricing evolved.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LMT(2022) \u2192 FAR: LMT's U.S. Government contracts were priced based on FAR-mandated cost-plus-reasonable-profit models, directly affecting revenue recognition and standalone selling price determinations.",
        "Hop 2: FAR \u2192 U.S. Government Contracts: FAR governed the pricing and cost recovery rules for U.S. Government contracts, including how pension and environmental costs could be allocated and recovered.",

Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts provide a fixed fee that is negotiated at the inception of the contract and does not vary with actual costs.\n\nWe assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If  combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.\n\nWe evaluate  the  products  or  services  promised  in  each  contract  at  inception  to  determine  whether  the  contract  should  be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have  more  than  one  distinct  performance  obligation,  which  occurs  when  we  perform  activities  that  are  not  highly  complex  or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.\n\nWe determine the transaction  price  for  each  contract  based  on  the  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  for  the  products  or services being provided under the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary, we estimate variable consideration at  the  most  likely  amount,  which  is  included  in  the  transaction  price  to  the  extent  it  is  probable  that  a  significant  reversal  of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.\n\nAt the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently  modified  to  include  changes  in  specifications,  requirements  or  price,  which  may  create  new  or  change  existing enforceable  rights  and  obligations.  Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  modification,  we  consider  whether  to  account  for  the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. Therefore,  such  modifications  are  accounted  for  as  if  they  were  part  of  the  existing  contract  and  recognized  as  a  cumulative adjustment to revenue.\n\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other  products  or  services).  Our  contracts  with  the  U.S.  Government,  including  FMS  contracts,  are  subject  to  the  Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.\n\nFor non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer's specifications.  When  it  is  necessary  to  allocate  the  transaction  price  to  multiple  performance  obligations,  we  typically  use  the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.\n\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For most contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience  and  pay  us  for  costs  incurred  plus  a  reasonable  profit.  For  most  non-U.S.  Government  contracts,  primarily international direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that  do  not  have  an  alternative  use  to  us  and  if  our  customer  were  to  terminate  the  contract  for  reasons  other  than  our  nonperformance  we  would  have  the  right  to  recover  damages  which  would  include,  among  other  potential  damages,  the  right  to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.",

We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.\n\n## REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

Funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. The funded status under ERISA is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP. Our goal has been to fund each of our qualified defined benefit pension plans to a level of at least 80% as determined in accordance with ERISA; which may require the use of different assumptions, such as the discount rate and longevity, than used under GAAP. All of our qualified defined benefit pension plans had an ERISA funded status of at least 80% as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nContributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. G overnment contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS rules govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. G overnment, including FMS. Pension cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made in accordance with ERISA.\n\nWe recovered $1.7 billion  in  both  2024  and  2023  as  CAS  pension  costs. Amounts  contributed  in  excess  of  the  CAS  pension  costs  recovered  under  U.S. Government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. Our prepayment credits were approximately $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The prepayment credit balance will increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets.\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\nWe are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental remediation issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP). We also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the ex tent and timing of our obligations. Environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more  judgmental  due  to,  for  ex ample,  changing  remediation  technologies.  To  determine  the  costs  related  to  clean  up  sites,  we  have  to  assess  the  ex tent  of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and evolving environmental standards.\n\nWe perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that the liabilities have been  incurred  and  the  amounts  can  be  reasonably  estimated  (see  the  discussion  under  'Environmental  Matters'  in  'Note  1  -  Organization  and  Significant Accounting  Policies'  and  'Note  14  -  Legal  Proceedings,  Commitments  and  Contingencies'  included  in  our  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements).  We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for environmental remediation activities, which result in the calculation of a range of estimates for each particular environmental remediation site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. G iven the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g. , a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the ex tent of contamination).\n\nUnder agreements reached with the U.S. G overnment, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing U.S. G overnment regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. G overnment business, after deducting  any  recoveries  received  from  insurance  or  other  PRPs,  are  allowable  in  establishing  prices  of  our  products  and  services. As  a  result,  most  of  the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. G overnment agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g., cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery by assessing, among other factors, U.S. G overnment regulations, our U.S. G overnment business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.\n\nAs disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery would be increased by",

The G400 is a clean-sheet (i.e., all new) design developed in concert with the  G500  and  G600,  thus  expanding  the  com m onality  across  the  Gulfstream   fam ily  of  aircraft.  The  G400  will  join  a  m arket  segm ent  in  which Gulfstream  has not participated for several decades. Both aircraft will enter service following FAA certification.\n\nThe G500 and G600 entered service in 2018 and 2019, respectively . These clean sheet aircraft replaced the G450 and G550 m odels, whose combined family has an installed base of m ore than 1,650 aircraft around the world. Our investm ent in the developm ent of these aircraft included a new  wing,  new  avionics,  new  fuselage  and  new  ergonom ically  designed  larger  interiors,  as  well  as  system s  and  technologies  to  im prove  the manufacturing process and quality of the aircraft. As a result, the G500 and G600 are faster, m ore fuel efficient, and have greater cabin volum e, reduced emissions, m ore range and im proved flight controls com pared with the aircraft they replaced. At year-end 2024, cum ulative deliveries of the G500 and G600 aircraft totaled m ore than 300.\n\nOur disciplined and consistent approach to new product developm ent has allowed us to introduce repeatedly first-to-m arket capabilities that set i n du stry  stan dards f or saf ety , perf orm ance, qual i ty , speed and com f ort. Product enhancem ent and developm ent efforts include initiatives in advanced avionics, com posites, flight-control and vision system s, acoustics, and cabin technologies.\n\nGulfstream designs, develops and m anufactures aircraft in Savannah, Georgia, including all large-cabin m odels. The m id-cabin G280 is assem bled by a non-U.S. partner. All m odels are outfitted in Gulfstream 's and Jet A viation's facilities. As Gulfstream 's aircraft portfolio and custom er base have grown and become increasingly global in reach over the years, we have invested in our facilities and operations around the world. At our Savannah campus, we added new purpose-built manufacturing facilities, increased aircraft service capacity , opened a custom er-support distribution center and expanded our R&amp;D capabilities.\n\nWe offer comprehensive support for the m ore than 3,000 Gulfstream  aircraft in service around the world and operate an extensive network of factory-owned service centers. W e continue to invest in these m aintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities and inventory to accom m odate fleet growth. We also operate a 24/7 year-round custom er support center and offer on-call Gulfstream  aircraft technicians ready to deploy around the world for custom er service requirem ents under our Field and Airborne Support Team  (FAST) rapid-response unit.\n\nIn addition to expanding the reach of Gulfstream 's aircraft m aintenance network outside the United States, Jet Aviation provides a com prehensive suite of innovative aircraft services for aircraft owners and operators around the world. With approxim ately 50 locations throughout North Am erica, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region, our offerings include m aintenance, com pletion, aircraft m anagem ent, charter, staffing and fixedbase operator (FBO) services.\n\nJet A viati on m anages approxim ately 310 business aircraft globally on behalf of individuals and corporate owners. W e operate a leading global FBO network of approximately 30 facilities on four continents and support all aircraft types with a full range of m aintenance services, including 24/7 global aircraft-on-ground support. W e also operate one of the world's largest custom  com pletion and refurbishm ent centers for both narrow- and wide-body aircraft and perform  m odifications, upgrades and lifecycle sustainm ent support for various governm ent fleets.

      "question": "How did the sensitivity of UPS's projected pension benefit obligations to discount rate changes evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what does this imply about the company's liability positioning under the bond matching approach used in the settlement process?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UPS disclosed that each basis point change in the discount rate affected the projected benefit obligation by a specific amount (in millions) for pension and postretirement medical plans. In 2023, the company again used the bond matching approach to determine discount rates, which is directly tied to the settlement process for these obligations. The 2023 disclosure also provided the updated sensitivity of these obligations to discount rate changes, indicating a recalibration of liability estimates based on current bond market conditions and projected cash flows. The change in sensitivity between years reflects shifts in UPS's pension liability profile and the effectiveness of the bond matching methodology in aligning with actual benefit payment schedules.",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments.

          "chunk_text": "\n(a)    Statutory balances reflect recognition of the estimated remaining statutory increase in reserves of approximately $3.6 billion through 2023 under the permitted accounting practice discussed further below and in Note 11 .\n\nStructured settlement annuities and life insurance contracts. We reinsure approximately 27,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 54. These structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-thanaverage life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins). Unlike long- term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nOur life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. As of December 31, 2021, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance blocks, we reinsure approximately $70 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.7 million policies with an average attained age of 60. In 2021, our incurred claims were approximately $0.6 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $50,000. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20 and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20-year level term policies, which represent approximately 25% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2024 as the policies reach the end of their 20-year level premium period.\n\nInvestment portfolio and other adjustments. Our insurance liabilities and annuity benefits are primarily supported by investment securities of $41.6 billion and $42.0 billion and commercial mortgage loans of $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, we expect to purchase approximately $5.5 billion of new assets through 2024 in conjunction with expected capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2022, pending completion of our December 31, 2021 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. Our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and comprise mainly investment-grade debt securities. The portfolio includes $6.7 billion of net unrealized gains that are recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of applicable taxes and other adjustments as of December 31, 2021.\n\nIn calculating our future policy benefit reserves, we are required to consider the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investment securities supporting our insurance contracts as if those unrealized amounts were realized. To the extent that the realization of gains would result in a premium deficiency, an adjustment is recorded to increase future policy benefit reserves with an after-tax offset to Accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2021, $3.4 billion of net unrealized gains on our investment securities required a related increase to future policy benefit reserves. This adjustment decreased from $8.2 billion in 2020 to $3.4 billion in 2021 primarily from the higher margin resulting from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities. See Note 3 for further information about our investment securities.\n\nWe manage the investments in our run-off insurance operations under strict investment guidelines, including limitations on asset class concentration, single issuer exposures, asset-liability duration variances, and other factors to meet credit quality, yield, liquidity and diversification requirements associated with servicing our insurance liabilities under reasonable circumstances. This process includes consideration of various asset allocation strategies and incorporates information from several external investment advisors to improve our investment yield subject to maintaining our ability to satisfy insurance liabilities when due, as well as considering our risk-based capital requirements, regulatory constraints, and tolerance for surplus volatility. With the expected capital contributions through 2024, we intend to further diversify our portfolio, including with non-traditional asset classes such as private equity, senior secured loans and infrastructure debt, among others. Asset allocation planning is a dynamic process that considers changes in market conditions, risk appetite, liquidity needs and other factors which are reviewed on a periodic basis by our investment team. Investing in these assets exposes us to both credit risk (i.e., debtor's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest), interest rate risk (i.e., market price, cash flow variability, and reinvestment risk due to changes in market interest rates) and equity risk (i.e., the risk arising from",

      "answer": "In 2023, UPS remeasured the UPS/IBT Plan due to the ARPA-triggered SFA payment of $35.8 billion to the CSPF, which resulted in a $6.4 billion actuarial gain and a materially reduced liability for coordinating benefits. By 2024, UPS\u2019s best estimate of coordinating benefits liability had become immaterial, indicating a significant reduction in financial risk exposure as the CSPF\u2019s solvency was extended through 2051 under the ARPA provisions. This reflects a strategic de-risking in pension obligations through legislative intervention and updated actuarial assumptions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS had 4.6 billion Class A shares and 5.6 billion Class B shares authorized, with Class A shares carrying 10 votes per share and being primarily held by employees, retirees, and founder-related trusts, while Class B shares were publicly traded with one vote per share. By 2024, the same number of shares (4.6 billion Class A and 5.6 billion Class B) remained authorized, and the convertibility feature of Class A shares into Class B shares was still in place. However, the continued maintenance of this dual-class structure suggests a strategic effort to balance insider control with public market liquidity. The unchanged voting rights and convertibility feature indicate that UPS preserved its governance framework, but the relative proportion of Class A shares held by insiders versus Class B shares in public hands may have shifted, influencing long-term corporate governance dynamics.",

      "question": "How did the increase in LMT's reach-forward losses on fixed-price contracts in 2023 relate to the risk of cost overruns, and how did this impact their 2024 financial performance on similar contracts?",
      "answer": "In 2023, LMT reported cumulative reach-forward losses of $270 million on a classified fixed-price incentive fee contract in their Aeronautics segment and $280 million on a ground-based radar program in their RMS segment. These losses were driven by technical and performance challenges under fixed-price contracts, where cost overruns directly impacted profitability. Fixed-price contracts inherently carry the risk that estimated completion costs may exceed contract value, especially in development programs with complex design and systems integration. In 2024, LMT acknowledged continued exposure to cost overruns on fixed-price development and production contracts, noting that such risks could lead to reduced margins, reach-forward losses, or even decisions not to bid on future programs. This evolution shows a direct temporal link: LMT's 2023 experience with cost overruns under fixed-price contracts led to heightened awareness and risk disclosures in 2024, reflecting a strategic recalibration in how the company approaches fixed-price bidding and cost estimation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LMT(2023) \u2192 Fixed-Price Contracts: LMT faced significant reach-forward losses of $270M and $280M on two major fixed-price contracts.",

        "Hop 3: Cost Overruns \u2190 LMT(2024): LMT's 2024 disclosures highlight increased risk awareness and potential financial impact from cost overruns on similar contracts, indicating a strategic evolution."

When this occurs, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is evident.\n\nUnder both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, if we are unable to control costs, our operating results could be adversely affected. Costs to complete a contract may increase for many reasons, including technical and manufacturing challenges, schedule delays, workforce-related issues, inaccurate initial contract cost estimates, the timeliness and availability of materials from suppliers, internal and subcontractor performance or product quality issues, inability to meet cost reduction initiatives or achieve efficiencies from digital transformation, changing laws or regulations, inflation and natural disasters. Certain contracts may impose other risks, such as forfeiting fees, paying penalties, or providing replacement systems in the event of performance failure.\n\nContracts for development programs include complex design and technical requirements and are often contracted on a cost-reimbursable basis, however, some of our  existing  development  programs  are  contracted  on  a  fix ed-price  basis.  In  addition,  we  have  certain  contracts  where  we  bid  upfront  on  cost-reimbursable development work and the follow-on fixed-price production options in one submission. We expect we also will bid on similar programs in the future. Fixed-price development work or fixed-price production options, especially on competitively bid programs, is inherently riskier than cost-reimbursable work because the revenue is  fix ed,  while  the  estim ates  of  costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant variability due to the nature of development programs. The technical complexity coupled with the fixed-price contract structure of certain of our ongoing development programs or new programs increases the risk that our costs will be greater than anticipated, resulting in reduced margins, operating profit, or reach-forward losses during the period of contract performance or upon contract award, all of which could be significant to our financial condition and operating results. Bidding upfront on fixed-price production options increases the risk that we may experience lower margins than expected, or a loss, on the production options because we must estimate the cost of producing a product before it has been  developed.  These  risks  may  cause  us  not  to  bid  on  certain  future  programs,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  future  growth  prospects  and  financial performance. See Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details about losses incurred on certain programs, including fixed-price development programs.\n\nContracts for the transition from development to production (e.g., low rate initial production (LRIP) contracts) also create performance and financial risks to our business because of the challenge of starting and stabilizing a manufacturing production and test line while concurrently validating final design and managing change in requirements or capabilities requested by the customer.\n\nMany of our contracts include multiple option years exercisable at the customer's discretion, which carries risk. The customer may decline to exercise an option, or the customer may exercise an option on a contract for which we expect to incur a loss or perform at a low margin, either of which could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nWe are routinely subject to audit by our customers on government contracts, including audits relating to our disclosed Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) rate structure or any changes to our CAS rate structure and the results of those audits could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations\n\nU.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency and various agency Inspectors G eneral, routinely  audit  and  investigate  government  contractors.  These  agencies  review  a  contractor's  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and  contract  terms, regarding, among other things, contract pricing, contract performance, cost structure and business systems. U.S. G overnment audits and investigations often take years to complete, and many result in no adverse action against us. Like many U.S. G overnment contractors, we have received audit and investigative reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices or that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts. Similarly, like other U.S. G overnment contractors, audits and investigations also occur related to cost reimbursements that are based upon our final allowable incurred costs for each year. We have unaudited or unsettled incurred cost claims related to past years, which limits our ability to issue final billings on contracts for which authorized and appropriated funds may be expiring or can result in delays in final billings and our ability to close out a contract. These audits could result in unanticipated changes to contract prices and the amount and timing of payments, which could affect profitability and cash flows for any particular reporting period. These changes could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in such period.\n\nIf  an  audit  or  investigation  uncovers  improper  or  illegal  activities,  we  may  be  subject  to  civil  or  criminal  penalties  and  administrative  sanctions,  including reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, repayments, penalties, fines or suspension or  debarment from doing business with the U.S. G overnment.  Reductions in the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, repayments, penalties, and fines could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in any particular reporting period, and suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our dependence on contracts with the U.S. G overnment. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Similar government oversight and risks to our business and reputation exist in most other countries where we conduct business.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GE's collaborative arrangement with Safran Aircraft Engines involved significant payments recorded as either cost of services sold ($2,125 million) or cost of equipment sold ($751 million), with GE making substantial sales of parts and services to CFM International based on arms-length terms. By 2024, CFM International remained a key non-consolidated joint venture, with GE continuing to make substantial sales of parts and services, indicating ongoing financial dependency. However, the context in 2024 emphasized strategic alignment and long-term growth in propulsion technologies, such as the RISE program, suggesting a deepening of the relationship through innovation and shared development goals.",

          "chunk_text": "We also enter into long-term services agreements in our Healthcare and Renewable Energy segments. Revenues are recognized for these arrangements on a straight-line basis consistent with the nature, timing and extent of our services, which primarily relate to routine maintenance and as needed equipment repairs. We generally invoice periodically as services are provided.\n\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time. We sell certain tangible products, largely spare parts, through our services businesses. We recognize revenues and bill our customers at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good, which is at the point in time we deliver the spare part to the customer.\n\nCOLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS. Our Aviation business enters into collaborative arrangements and joint ventures with manufacturers and suppliers of components used to build and maintain certain engines. Under these arrangements, GE and its collaborative partners share in the risks and rewards of these programs through various revenue, cost and profit sharing payment structures. GE recognizes revenue and costs for these arrangements based on the scope of work GE is responsible for transferring to its customers. GE's payments to participants are primarily recorded as either cost of services sold ($2,125 million, $2,407 million and $3,517 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively) or as cost of equipment sold ($751 million, $1,093 million and $1,396 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively). Our most significant collaborative arrangement is with Safran Aircraft engines, a subsidiary of Safran Group of France, which sells LEAP and CFM56 engines through CFM International, a jointly owned non-consolidated company. GE makes substantial sales of parts and services to CFM International based on arms-length terms.\n\nINSURANCE REVENUES. Insurance revenues is comprised primarily of premiums and investment income related to our run-off Insurance business. For traditional long-duration insurance contracts, we report premiums as revenue when due. Premiums received on non-traditional long-duration insurance contracts and investment contracts, including annuities without significant mortality risk, are not reported as revenues but rather as deposit liabilities. We recognize revenues for charges and assessments on these contracts, mostly for mortality, contract initiation, administration and surrender. Amounts credited to policyholder accounts are charged to expense.\n\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH. Debt securities and money market instruments with original maturities of three months or less are included in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash unless classified as available-for-sale investment securities. Restricted cash primarily comprised funds restricted in connection with certain ongoing litigation matters and amounted to $317 million and $408 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES. We report investments in available-for-sale debt securities and certain equity securities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded to other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes and adjustments related to our insurance liabilities. Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recorded to earnings.\n\nAlthough we generally do not have the intent to sell any specific debt securities in the ordinary course of managing our portfolio, we may sell debt securities prior to their maturities for a variety of reasons, including diversification, credit quality, yield and liquidity requirements and the funding of claims and obligations to policyholders.\n\nWe regularly review investment securities for impairment. For debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate qualitative criteria, such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, to determine whether we do not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. We also evaluate quantitative criteria including determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. If we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, we consider the security to contain an expected credit loss, and we record the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its recoverable amount in earnings as an allowance for credit loss and the difference between the security's recoverable amount and fair value in other comprehensive income. If we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the security is considered impaired, and we recognize the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value in earnings. See Note 3 for further information.\n\nCURRENT RECEIVABLES. Amounts due from customers arising from the sales of equipment and services are recorded at the outstanding amount, less allowance for losses. We regularly monitor the recoverability of our receivables. See Note 4 for further information.\n\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. When we record customer receivables, contract assets and financing receivables arising from revenue transactions, as well as commercial mortgage loans and reinsurance recoverables in our run-off insurance operations, financial guarantees and certain commitments, we record an allowance for credit losses for the current expected credit losses (CECL) inherent in the asset over its expected life. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account deducted from the amortized cost basis of the assets to present their net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected. Each period the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through earnings to reflect expected credit losses over the remaining lives of the assets. We evaluate debt securities with unrealized losses to determine whether any of the losses arise from concerns about the issuer's credit or the underlying collateral and record an allowance for credit losses, if required.",

          "chunk_text": "ABOUT GE AEROSPACE. General Electric Company operates as GE Aerospace (GE Aerospace or the Company). GE Aerospace is a global aerospace leader with the industry's largest and growing commercial propulsion fleet. The Company's installed base of approximately 45,000 commercial and 25,000 military engines drives our aftermarket services business, which represents approximately 70% of revenue, reflecting the strength of customer demand across our business. Through FLIGHT DECK, the Company's proprietary lean operating model, GE Aerospace is prioritizing safety, quality, delivery and cost, to drive focused execution and bridge strategy to results. We are focused on delivering against our strategic priorities for today (services and readiness), tomorrow (delivering the production and services ramp for new engines) and the future (inventing next generation flight technology for our commercial and defense customers). Our global team is building on more than a century of innovation and learning, as we invent the future of flight, lift people up and bring them home safely.\n\nOn January 3, 2023, the Company completed the separation of its healthcare business into an independent publicly traded company, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (GE HealthCare), and on April 2, 2024, the Company completed the separation of its GE V ernova business into an independent publicly traded company, GE Vernova, Inc. (GE Vernova). In connection with these separations, the historical results of GE HealthCare and GE V ernova, and certain assets and liabilities included in the separations, are reported in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. See Note 2 for further information.\n\nWe serve customers in approximately 120 countries. M anufacturing and service operations are carried out at 67 facilities located in 22 states in the United States and Puerto Rico, of which 24 are owned, and at 67 facilities located in 24 other countries, of which 34 are owned.\n\nSEGMENTS. GE Aerospace operates through two reportable segments: Commercial Engines &amp; Services and Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies.\n\nCOMMERCIAL ENGINES &amp; SERVICES. Commercial Engines &amp; Services (CES) designs, develops, manufactures and services jet engines for commercial airframes, as well as business aviation and aeroderivative applications. Services include maintenance, repair and overhaul (M RO) of engines and the sale of spare parts, and we offer services under a variety of arrangements such as long-term service agreements or time and material contracts. CES was approximately 70% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, with services representing 74% of total CES revenue.\n\nOur CES customers for equipment and services consist primarily of airframers and airlines, including both Boeing and A irbus, and third-party M RO shops, to whom we sell equipment and license M RO technology. CES engines power aircraft in all commercial categories-narrowbody, widebody and regional-and this includes engines sold by joint venture partners, the most significant of which is CFM  International, a 50-50 non-consolidated joint venture with Safran A ircraft Engines, a subsidiary of Safran Group of France. Depending on the aircraft model, airline customers may have a choice between our engines and those of other manufacturers or, as in the case of some Boeing models, our engines may be the sole source engine for a particular aircraft.\n\nCommercial and financial dynamics for major engine platforms often play out over the course of many years, as new product development cycles are long and, after initial sale, commercial engines can operate for decades with services in the aftermarket. In the narrowbody aircraft segment, we are in the midst of a significant ramp in production of the LEA P engine, which entered into service in 2016 and is expected in the coming years to overtake the mature CFM 56 as the industry's most utilized narrowbody engine. This is expected to also drive a significant increase in shop visits and need for M RO capacity as LEA P engines come due for services. In the widebody aircraft segment, we have a range of engine platforms that are in different stages of their lifecycles. These include the more mature CF6 and GE90 engines, as well as the GEnx engine that entered into service in 2011 and the GE9X engine that will power the Boeing 777X  when that aircraft enters into serv ice. We also have engines that power regional and business aircraft.\n\nWe have been and remain committed to investing in developing and maturing technologies that enable a more sustainable future of flight. Notably, CFM International's Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) program is a suite of pioneering technologies including Open Fan, compact core and hybrid electric systems for compatibility with alternative fuels. We recently completed more than 250 tests on developing a full-scale Open Fan engine. This is one of several initiativ es underway to help invent the future of flight.\n\nDEFENSE &amp; PROPULSION TECHNOLOGIES. Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies (DPT) is a leading provider of defense engines and critical aircraft systems, and it consists of our Defense &amp; Systems and Propulsion &amp; A dditive Technologies businesses. DPT was approximately 25% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, with services representing 56% of total DPT revenue.\n\nDefense &amp; Systems - Defense &amp; Systems designs, develops, manufactures and services jet engines and avionics and power systems for governments, militaries and commercial airframers. Services include M RO of engines and the sale of spare parts.\n\nOur product performance and dedication to innovation have earned long-standing relationships with airframers, shipyards, government agencies and other customers globally. We also regularly work with government customers on the development of classified and unclassified advanced products, including combat engines, hypersonics and unmanned applications. Recently, our team successfully demonstrated a hybrid electric propulsion system rated at one megawatt with the U.S. A rmy.\n\nOur defense engines power a wide variety of fighters, bombers, tankers, transport, helicopters and surveillance aircraft, as well as aeroderivative engines for marine applications. Significant product platforms include the F110, F404 and F414 for combat engines, the T408, T700 and T901 for rotorcraft engines and the LM2500 for mobility and marine engines.",

          "chunk_text": "EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS. Equity method investments are investments in entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest, but over which we have significant influence. Significant influence typically exists if we have a 20% to 50% ownership interest in the investee. Equity method investments are assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when events occur, or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not the fair value of the asset is below its carrying value. If a decline in the v alue of an equity  method inv estment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. Equity method investments are recognized within A ll other assets in our Statement of Financial Position. Our share of the results of equity method investments is recognized within Other income (loss) in our Statement Earnings (Loss) since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with our operations. See Notes 9 and 26 for further information.\n\nWe enter into related party transactions with certain equity method investments, of which, the most significant are with CFM  International, a non-consolidated company jointly owned with Safran Aircraft Engines, a subsidiary of Safran Group of France. We make substantial sales of parts and services to CFM International. Related party transactions with other equity method investees primarily consist of purchases of engine parts or maintenance services, which are not significant with any single related party.\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVES. We receive grants and incentives from various federal, state, local, and foreign governments in exchange for compliance with certain conditions relating to our activities in a specific jurisdiction which encourage investment, job creation and retention, and environmental objectives including emissions reductions. We recognize government grants as a reduction to the related expense or asset when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions of the grant, the grant is received or is probable of receipt and the amount is determinable. Government grants resulted in reductions of $117 million, $99 million and $100 million to research and development expense in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term cash investment that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less, including debt securities and money market instruments unless classified as available-for-sale investment securities. Restricted cash primarily comprised funds restricted in connection with certain ongoing litigation matters and amounted to an insignificant amount at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES. We report investments in available-for-sale debt securities and certain equity securities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded to other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recorded to earnings.\n\nAlthough we generally do not have the intent to sell any specific debt securities in the ordinary course of managing our portfolio, we may sell debt securities prior to their maturities for a v ariety  of reasons, including div ersification, credit quality , y ield and liquidity  requirements and the funding of claims and obligations to policyholders.\n\nWe regularly review investment securities for impairment. For debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate qualitative criteria, such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, to determine whether we do not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. We also evaluate quantitative criteria including determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. If we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, we consider the security to contain an expected credit loss, and we record the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its recoverable amount in earnings as an allowance for credit loss and the difference between the security's recoverable amount and fair value in other comprehensive income. If we intend to sell the security  or it is more likely  than not we will be required to sell the security  before recov ery  of its amortiz ed cost basis, the security  is considered impaired, and we recognize the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value in earnings. See Note 3 for further information.\n\nCURRENT RECEIVABLES. Amounts due from customers arising from the sales of equipment and services are recorded at the outstanding amount, less allowance for losses. We regularly monitor the recoverability of our receivables. See Note 4 for further information.\n\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. When we record customer receivables and contract assets arising from revenue transactions, as well as commercial mortgage loans and reinsurance recoverables in our run-off insurance operations, financial guarantees and certain commitments, we record an allowance for credit losses for the current expected credit losses (CECL) inherent in the asset over its expected life. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account deducted from the amortized cost basis of the assets to present their net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected. Each period, the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through earnings to reflect expected credit losses over the remaining lives of the assets. We evaluate debt securities with unrealized losses to determine whether any of the losses arise from concerns about the issuer's credit or the underlying collateral and record an allowance for credit losses, if required.\n\nWe estimate expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. When measuring expected credit losses, we pool assets with similar country risk and credit risk characteristics. Changes in the relevant information may significantly affect the estimates of expected credit losses.\n\nINVENTORIES. All inv entories are stated at lower of cost or realiz able v alues. Cost of inv entories is primarily  determined using the av erage cost method. See Note 5 for further information.\n\n44 2024 FORM  10-K",

      "question": "How did UPS's application of ASU 2020-04 in 2023 influence their handling of contract modifications in 2024, particularly regarding the transition from LIBOR to SOFR in debt instruments?",
      "answer": "In 2023, UPS transitioned affected debt instruments and contracts to SOFR as part of reference rate reform under ASU 2020-04, though they did not elect the practical expedients provided by the standard. ASU 2020-04 specifically allowed optional expedients for contract modifications related to reference rate reform, which were extended through 2024. In 2024, UPS\u2019s accounting policy on contract modifications explicitly addressed how changes to existing contracts\u2014such as those involving rate transitions\u2014are accounted for prospectively when they do not add distinct services. This indicates that the earlier adoption of ASU 2020-04 directly shaped UPS\u2019s structured approach to contract modifications in 2024, especially for non-distinct service changes like reference rate adjustments.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Satisfaction of Performance Obligations\n\nWe generally recognize revenue over time as we perform services in the contract because our customers receive the benefit of our services as goods are transported from one location to another. Further, if we were unable to complete delivery to the final location, those services would not need to be re-performed.\n\nWe recognize revenue based on the extent of progress towards completion of our services. We use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our package delivery contracts because it best depicts the benefit received by the customer, which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under this measure, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the service. Revenues, including ancillary or accessorial fees and reductions for estimated customer incentives, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Costs to fulfill include labor and other direct costs and an allocation of indirect costs.\n\nFor our freight forwarding contracts, an output method of progress based on time-in-transit is utilized as the timing of costs incurred does not best depict the benefit to the customer. In our Logistics business we have a right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customers of our performance completed to date; therefore we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice the customer.\n\n## Variable Consideration\n\nOur contracts commonly contain customer incentives, guaranteed service refunds or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the rates paid for services. These variable amounts are generally dependent upon achievement of certain incentive tiers or performance metrics. We record revenue, which may be reduced by incentives or other contract provisions, to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative amounts recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of revenue are based on an assessment of anticipated customer spending and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us.\n\n## Contract Modifications\n\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in the rates we charge our customers or to add additional, distinct services. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new, or changes the existing, enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications that add distinct goods or services are treated as separate contracts. Contract modifications that do not add distinct goods or services typically change the price of existing services. These contract modifications are accounted for prospectively as the remaining performance obligations are distinct.\n\n## Payment Terms\n\nUnder the typical payment terms of our customer contracts, customers pay at periodic intervals, which are generally seven days within our U.S. Domestic Package business, for shipments included on invoices received. Invoices are generated each week on the week-ending day, which is Saturday for the majority of our U.S. Domestic Package business, but could be another day depending on the business unit or the specific agreement with the customer. It is not customary business practice to ex tend payment terms past 90 days and, as such, we do not have a practice of including a significant financing component within our contracts with customers.\n\n## Principal vs. Agent Considerations\n\nIn our transportation businesses, we may utilize independent contractors and third-party carriers to perform transportation services. We have determined that all our major businesses act as principal rather than agent within their revenue arrangements. Consequently, revenue and the associated purchased transportation costs are reported on a gross basis within our statements of consolidated income.\n\n## Accounts Receivable, Net\n\nAccounts receivable, net , include amounts billed and currently due from customers. The amounts due are stated at their net estimated realizable value. Losses on accounts receivable are recognized when reasonable and supportable forecasts affect the expected collectability. This requires us to make our best estimate of the current expected losses inherent in our accounts receivable at each balance sheet date. These estimates require consideration of historical loss experience, adjusted for current conditions, forward-looking indicators, trends in customer payment frequency, and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data, including present and future economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and",

      "question": "How did the application of ASU 2020-04 to contract modifications in 2023 influence UPS's decision not to apply the practical expedients under Topic 848 during their reference rate reform transitions in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, UPS disclosed that contract modifications were governed by specific accounting treatments under GAAP, and they applied ASU 2020-04, which provided optional expedients for contracts affected by reference rate reform, such as the transition away from LIBOR. This guidance was effective for contract modifications made between March 12, 2020, and December 31, 2024. However, by December 31, 2023, UPS had already transitioned its affected debt instruments and contracts to alternative reference rates. As a result, in 2024, UPS did not elect to apply the practical expedients under Topic 848 because the transition was already completed, and no further impact was observed. This decision reflects a strategic and timely execution of reference rate reform adjustments in 2023 that rendered the optional relief unnecessary in 2024.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n- A fair value hedge refers to hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an existing asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings during the current period, together with the gain or loss on the hedged item.\n- A net investment hedge refers to the use of cross currency swaps, forward contracts or foreign-currency-denominated debt to hedge portions of net investments in foreign operations. For instruments that meet the hedge accounting requirements, the net gains or losses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income, and are recorded in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings.\n\n## Adoption of New Accounting Standards\n\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), and in December 2022 subsequently issued ASU 2022-06, to temporarily ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. As of December 31, 2023, we had transitioned our affected debt instruments and contracts to an alternative reference rate and, as a result, we did not elect to apply the practical expedients provided under Topic 848 to these transitions, and we did not observe any further impact as of December 31, 2024.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued an ASU on segment reporting. The standard requires new disclosures reconciling significant segment expenses to segment profit measures and additional qualitative information about how segment measures are used by management. Effective December 31, 2024, we adopted this ASU retrospectively for all prior periods presented. The adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or internal controls. See note 14 for our segment disclosures.\n\nOther accounting pronouncements adopted during the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or internal controls.\n\n## Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued an ASU to enhance tax-related disclosures. This update will require more standardized categories for tax rate reconciliation and additional detail for significant tax  items. It will also require a breakdown of income tax es paid by jurisdiction ex ceeding 5% of total tax es and remove certain disclosure requirements for unremitted foreign earnings and uncertain tax positions. The standard becomes effective for us in the first quarter of 2025. We are evaluating its impact on our financial statements, disclosures and internal controls but do not expect this ASU to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or internal controls.\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued an ASU on expense disaggregation disclosures, which will require tabular disclosure in the notes to financial statements for specific ex pense categories. The standard becomes effective for us beginning with our 2027 annual report and for interim and annual periods thereafter. This ASU provides for additional expense disclosures. We are evaluating its impact on our financial statements, disclosures and internal controls but do not expect this ASU to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or internal controls.\n\nOther accounting pronouncements issued, but not effective until after December 31, 2024, are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or internal controls.",

      "question": "How did the evolution of GE's stake in Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company from 2022 to 2024 influence its exposure to structured settlement annuities, particularly in terms of reserve liabilities and risk profile shifts?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GE's stake in Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC) was part of its run-off insurance operations, with UFLIC assuming structured settlement annuities from Genworth Financial Inc. These annuities contributed to $10.3 billion in structured settlement annuities and life insurance reserves as of December 31, 2021. By 2024, GE reinsured approximately 23,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 57, many of which were underwritten on impaired lives and projected to pay out over decades. This indicates a continued exposure to long-duration liabilities, with mortality and reinvestment risk becoming more central to GE's risk profile. The shift from a focus on reinsurance treaties and premium collections in 2022 to a more defined exposure with fixed payment obligations in 2024 shows a transformation in how GE's relationship with structured settlement annuities evolved, with increased emphasis on longevity and interest rate risk.",

The run-off insurance operations of North American Life and Health (NALH) primarily include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumes long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumes long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc.(Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004. The vast majority of NALH's reinsurance exposures are long-duration arrangements that still involve substantial levels of premium collections and benefit payments even though ERAC and UFLIC have not entered into new reinsurance treaties in more than a decade. These long-duration arrangements involve a number of direct writers and contain a range of risk transfer provisions and other contractual elements. In many instances, these arrangements do not transfer to us 100 percent of the risk embodied in the encompassed underlying policies issued by the direct writers. Furthermore, we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies.\n\nOur run-off insurance liabilities and annuity benefits primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for those insurance contract claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported. The insurance liabilities and annuity benefits amounted to $37.2 billion and $42.2 billion and primarily relate to individual long- term care insurance reserves of $21.7 billion and $21.3 billion and structured settlement annuities and life insurance reserves of $10.3 billion and $10.7 billion, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in insurance liabilities and annuity benefits of $5.0 billion from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to an adjustment of $4.8 billion resulting from the higher margin from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities that would result in a premium deficiency should those gains be realized.\n\nIn addition to NALH, Electric Insurance Company (EIC) is a property and casualty insurance company primarily providing insurance to GE and its employees with net claim reserves of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We believe recent elevated mortality across our portfolio and lower long-term care insurance claims are short term in nature and attributable to COVID-19. However, the effects of COVID-19, including the continued emergence of variants and success of vaccinations, remain uncertain and may result in variability in levels of future mortality and long-term care insurance claims activity, including changes in policyholder behavior (e.g., policyholder willingness to enter long-term care facilities or seek care at home), among others. These monitoring activities also allow us to evaluate opportunities to reduce our insurance risk profile and improve the results of our run-off insurance operations. Such opportunities may include the pursuit of future premium rate increases and benefit reductions on long-term care insurance contracts in accordance with our reinsurance contracts with our ceding companies; recapture and reinsurance transactions to reduce risk where economically justified; investment strategies to improve asset and liability matching and enhance investment portfolio yields; and managing our expense levels.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. For example, policyholders with a lifetime benefit period could receive coverage up to the specified daily maximum as long as the policyholder is claim eligible and receives care for covered services; inflation protection options increase the daily maximums to protect the policyholder from the rising cost of care with some options providing automatic annual increases of 3% to 5% or policyholder elected inflation-indexed increases for increased premium; joint life policies provide coverage for two lives which permit either life under a single contract to receive benefits at the same time or separately; and premium payment options may limit the period over which the policyholder pays premiums while still receiving coverage after premium payments cease, which may limit the impact of our benefit from future premium rate increases.\n\nThe ERAC long-term care insurance portfolio comprises more than two-thirds of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is assumed from approximately 30 ceding companies through various types of reinsurance and retrocession contracts having complex terms and conditions. Compared to the overall long-term care insurance block, it has a lower average attained age and more policies (and covered lives, as over one-third of the policies are joint life policies) with lifetime benefit periods and/or with inflation protection options which may result in a higher potential for future claims.\n\nThe UFLIC long-term care insurance block comprises the remainder of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is more mature with policies that are more uniform, as it is assumed from a single ceding company, Genworth, and has fewer policies with lifetime benefit periods, no joint life policies and slightly more policies with inflation protection options.\n\nPresented in the table below are GAAP and statutory reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(a)    Pending completion of our December 31, 2024 statutory reporting process.\n\nStructured settlement annuities. We reinsure approximately 23,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 57. A pproximately 27% of these structured settlement annuities were underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than-average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment). Unlike long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nLife Insurance contracts. Our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. A t December 31, 2024, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance portfolio, we reinsure approximately $45 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.1 million policies with an average attained age of 63. In 2024, our incurred claims were approximately $0.4 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $46,100. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20- and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20- and 30-year level term policies, which represent approximately 7% and 43% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2026 and 2035 as the policies reach the end of their 20- and 30-year level premium period, respectively.\n\nCritical Accounting E stimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums and are estimated based on actuarial assumptions such as mortality, morbidity, terminations, and expenses. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings. Our annual review procedures include updating certain experience studies since our last completed review, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. The review of experience and assumptions is a comprehensive and complex process that depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. The review relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance portfolio includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.",

The standards provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to existing contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The standards apply only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') or another reference rate to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The standards were effective upon issuance and can generally be applied through December 31, 2024. While there has been no material effect to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows from reference rate reform as of May 31, 2024, we continue to monitor our contracts and transactions for potential application of these ASUs.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which expands disclosures about a public entity's reportable segments and requires more enhanced information about a reportable segment's expenses, interim segment profit or loss, and how a public entity's chief operating decision maker uses reported segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and allocating resources. The update will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 (fiscal 2025). We are assessing the effect of this update on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands disclosures in an entity's income tax rate reconciliation table and regarding cash taxes paid both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The update will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 (fiscal 2026). We are assessing the effect of this update on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nIn March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') adopted final rules requiring public entities to provide certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. As part of the disclosures, entities will be required to quantify certain effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions in a note to their audited financial statements. The rules will be effective for annual periods beginning in calendar 2025 (fiscal 2026). In April 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed implementation of the final rules pending certain legal challenges. We are assessing the effect of the new rules on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 3: CREDIT LOSSES\n\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our trade receivables. We assess ability to pay for certain customers by conducting a credit review, which considers the customer's established credit rating and our assessment of creditworthiness. We determine the allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable using a combination of specific reserves for accounts that are deemed to exhibit credit loss indicators and general reserves that are determined using loss rates based on historical write-offs by geography and recent forecast information, including underlying economic expectations. We update our estimate of credit loss reserves quarterly, considering recent write-offs, collections information, and underlying economic expectations.\n\nCredit losses were $421 million in 2024, $696 million in 2023, and $403 million in 2022. Our allowance for credit losses was $436 million at May 31, 2024 and $472 million at May 31, 2023.",

      "question": "How did the extension of reference rate reform relief under ASU 2022-06 impact FedEx's application of ASU 2020-04 between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of contract monitoring and potential financial effects?",
      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, FedEx noted that ASU 2020-04 applied through December 31, 2022, and while there was no material effect on financial condition or results of operations as of May 31, 2022, the company continued to monitor contracts for potential application of the guidance. With the issuance of ASU 2022-06 in December 2022, the sunset date for applying ASU 2020-04 was extended to December 31, 2024. This extension allowed FedEx more time to address the transition away from LIBOR and apply the optional expedients under ASU 2020-04 to a broader set of contracts. By fiscal year 2023, FedEx continued to monitor contracts affected by reference rate reform but still reported no material financial impact as of May 31, 2024, indicating that the extended relief provided by ASU 2022-06 gave the company additional time without immediate financial consequences.",

        "Hop 2: [ASU 2020-04] \u2192 [ASU 2022-06]: ASU 2022-06 extended the sunset date for applying ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, providing companies with more time to address reference rate reform impacts.",
        "Hop 3: [ASU 2022-06] \u2190 [FDX](2023): In 2023, FedEx was subject to ASU 2022-06 and noted that ASU 2020-04 could now be applied through December 31, 2024, with continued monitoring of contracts and no material financial effect as of May 31, 2024."

          "chunk_text": "## FEDEX CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\n\nNew accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly impact our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements. We believe the following new accounting guidance is relevant to the readers of our financial statements.\n\nNew Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to existing contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The amendments apply only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') or another reference rate to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The guidance was effective upon issuance and can generally be applied through December 31, 2022. While there has been no material effect to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows from reference rate reform as of May 31, 2022, we continue to monitor our contracts and transactions for potential application of this ASU. See Note 7 for information on the replacement of LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR') in our Credit Agreements (defined below) on March 15, 2022.\n\nIn July 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-05, Leases (Topic 842), which provides alternative accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases with variable lease payments. The guidance allows lessors to classify and account for a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on a reference index or rate as an operating lease if certain criteria are met. These changes will be effective June 1, 2022 (fiscal 2023). We do not have leases classified as sales-type or direct financing and will apply the guidance on a prospective basis to applicable leases that commence or are modified on or after June 1, 2022.\n\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832), which requires annual disclosures that increase the transparency of transactions involving government grants, including (1) the types of transactions, (2) the accounting for those transactions, and (3) the effect of those transactions on an entity's financial statements. These changes will be effective June 1, 2022 (fiscal 2023). This standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 3: CREDIT LOSSES\n\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our trade receivables. We assess ability to pay for certain customers by conducting a credit review, which considers the customer's established credit rating and our assessment of creditworthiness. We determine the allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable using a combination of specific reserves for accounts that are deemed to exhibit credit loss indicators and general reserves that are determined using loss rates based on historical write-offs by geography and recent forecast information, including underlying economic expectations. We update our estimate of credit loss reserves quarterly, considering recent write-offs, collections information, and underlying economic expectations.\n\nCredit losses were $403 million in 2022, $577 million in 2021, and $442 million in 2020. Our allowance for credit losses was $340 million as of May 31, 2022 and $358 million at May 31, 2021.\n\n## NOTE 4: BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\n\nOn December 23, 2020, we acquired ShopRunner, Inc. ('ShopRunner'), an e-commerce platform that directly connects brands and merchants with online shoppers, for $228 million in cash from operations. The majority of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and intangibles. The financial results of ShopRunner are included in 'Corporate, other, and eliminations' from the date of acquisition and were not material to our results of operations; therefore, pro forma financial information has not been provided.",

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS adjusted NAV estimates for real estate investments based on investment activity between the date of fund managers\u2019 financial reports and year-end, with auditors highlighting significant subjectivity and the need for direct confirmation with fund managers. By 2023, while the overall valuation methodology remained consistent\u2014still relying on NAV as a practical expedient\u2014UPS provided more detailed disclosures about the inherent limitations in determining fair values for these investments, including the potential for discrepancies between reported NAV and actual market value. The company also maintained transparency about unfunded commitments totaling $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2023, signaling continued long-term exposure to these less liquid assets.",

In order to estimate NAV, the Company evaluates audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers, and makes adjustments, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. These investments are not actively traded, and their values can only be estimated using these subjective assumptions.\n\nAuditing the estimated NAV of these hedge fund, risk parity, private debt, private equity and real estate investments requires a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity to evaluate the completeness, reliability and relevance of the inputs used by management.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the inputs used by management to estimate the NAV of the U.S. Plans' hedge fund, risk parity, private debt, private equity and real estate investments included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls, including those related to the reliability of values reported by fund managers, the relevance of asset class benchmark returns, and the completeness and accuracy of unobservable inputs related to the underlying assets of the funds.\n- For certain investments, we confirmed directly with the respective fund manager its preliminary estimate of the fund's NAV as of December 31, 2021.\n- For certain investments, we inquired of management to understand year-over-year changes in the fund manager's estimate of NAV and compared the fund's return on investment to other available qualitative and quantitative information relevant to the fund.\n- We evaluated the Company's historical ability to accurately estimate NAV for these funds by comparing each fund's recorded valuation as of its prior fiscal year end to the NA V per the audited fund financial statements (which are received in arrears of the Company's reporting timetable).\n\n## Revenue - Refer to Note 2, Revenue Recognition, to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nApproximately 82 percent of the Company's revenues are from its global small package operations that provide time-definite delivery services for express letters, documents, small packages and palletized freight via air and ground services. The Company's global small package revenues are comprised of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions sourced from systems that were primarily developed by the Company. The processing of transactions, including the recording of them, is highly automated and based on contractual terms with the Company's customers.\n\nAuditing global small package revenue required a significant extent of effort and the involvement of professionals with expertise in information technology ('IT') necessary for us to identify, test, and evaluate the Company's systems, software applications and automated controls.",

The G800 replaces the G650 and G650ER, which currently operate in 55 countries with m ore than 580 aircraft of this fam ily in service. The G400 is a clean-sheet (i.e., all new) design developed in concert with the  G500  and  G600,  thus  expanding  the  com m onality  across  the  Gulfstream   fam ily  of  aircraft.  The  G400  will  join  a  m arket  segm ent  in  which Gulfstream  has not participated for several decades. Both aircraft will enter service following FAA certification.\n\nThe G500 and G600 entered service in 2018 and 2019, respectively . These clean sheet aircraft replaced the G450 and G550 m odels, whose combined family has an installed base of m ore than 1,650 aircraft around the world. Our investm ent in the developm ent of these aircraft included a new  wing,  new  avionics,  new  fuselage  and  new  ergonom ically  designed  larger  interiors,  as  well  as  system s  and  technologies  to  im prove  the manufacturing process and quality of the aircraft. As a result, the G500 and G600 are faster, m ore fuel efficient, and have greater cabin volum e, reduced emissions, m ore range and im proved flight controls com pared with the aircraft they replaced. At year-end 2024, cum ulative deliveries of the G500 and G600 aircraft totaled m ore than 300.\n\nOur disciplined and consistent approach to new product developm ent has allowed us to introduce repeatedly first-to-m arket capabilities that set i n du stry  stan dards f or saf ety , perf orm ance, qual i ty , speed and com f ort. Product enhancem ent and developm ent efforts include initiatives in advanced avionics, com posites, flight-control and vision system s, acoustics, and cabin technologies.\n\nGulfstream designs, develops and m anufactures aircraft in Savannah, Georgia, including all large-cabin m odels. The m id-cabin G280 is assem bled by a non-U.S. partner. All m odels are outfitted in Gulfstream 's and Jet A viation's facilities. As Gulfstream 's aircraft portfolio and custom er base have grown and become increasingly global in reach over the years, we have invested in our facilities and operations around the world. At our Savannah campus, we added new purpose-built manufacturing facilities, increased aircraft service capacity , opened a custom er-support distribution center and expanded our R&amp;D capabilities.\n\nWe offer comprehensive support for the m ore than 3,000 Gulfstream  aircraft in service around the world and operate an extensive network of factory-owned service centers. W e continue to invest in these m aintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities and inventory to accom m odate fleet growth. We also operate a 24/7 year-round custom er support center and offer on-call Gulfstream  aircraft technicians ready to deploy around the world for custom er service requirem ents under our Field and Airborne Support Team  (FAST) rapid-response unit.\n\nIn addition to expanding the reach of Gulfstream 's aircraft m aintenance network outside the United States, Jet Aviation provides a com prehensive suite of innovative aircraft services for aircraft owners and operators around the world. With approxim ately 50 locations throughout North Am erica, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region, our offerings include m aintenance, com pletion, aircraft m anagem ent, charter, staffing and fixedbase operator (FBO) services.\n\nJet A viati on m anages approxim ately 310 business aircraft globally on behalf of individuals and corporate owners.

      "answer": "In 2022, General Dynamics included state and local income taxes allocable to U.S. government contracts directly in operating costs and expenses, rather than in the tax provision, indicating a focus on aligning cost reporting with FAR requirements that govern cost allowability and allocation. By 2024, the company continued to be subject to the FAR and CAS, with an emphasis on managing supplier risks and flexible pricing terms in customer contracts to mitigate cost pressures\u2014likely a response to ongoing regulatory scrutiny and audit requirements under the FAR. This reflects a strategic adaptation to maintain compliance while managing rising operational costs, especially as supply chain disruptions and pricing volatility became more pronounced.",

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

      "answer": "Caterpillar maintained its ownership requirement of Cat Financial through the support agreement from 2022 to 2024, ensuring continued access to internal financing mechanisms during periods of financial stress. In 2022, Caterpillar outlined that in the event of a credit rating downgrade, ME&T operations would rely on cash flow, existing cash balances, and borrowings from Cat Financial. By 2024, the company expanded its consolidated credit lines to $4.06 billion, which, when combined with the unchanged support agreement, indicates a strengthened liquidity position. This evolution suggests Caterpillar has fortified its ability to manage potential downgrades by increasing external credit availability while preserving internal financial support structures, thereby improving resilience against increased borrowing costs or restricted access to debt markets.",

A downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. In the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, ME&amp;T's operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances, borrowings from Cat Financial and access to our committed credit facilities. Our Financial Products' operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our committed credit facilities and other credit line facilities of Cat Financial, and  potential  borrowings  from  Caterpillar.  In  addition,  we  maintain  a  support  agreement  with  Cat  Financial,  which  requires Caterpillar to remain the sole owner of Cat Financial and may, under certain circumstances, require Caterpillar to make payments to Cat Financial should Cat Financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios.\n\nWe facilitate voluntary supply chain finance programs (the 'Programs') through participating financial institutions. The Programs are  available  to  a  wide  range  of  suppliers  and  allows  them  the  option  to  manage  their  cash  flow.  We  are  not  a  party  to  the agreements  between  the  participating  financial  institutions  and  the  suppliers  in  connection  with  the  Programs.  The  range  of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the Programs. The amounts payable to participating financial institutions for suppliers who voluntarily participate in the Programs and included in accounts payable in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position were $822 million and $533 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The amounts settled through the Programs and paid to participating financial institutions were $4.1 billion and $3.2 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. We account for payments made under the Programs, the same as our other accounts payable, as a reduction to our cash flows from operations. We do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity.\n\n## Material cash requirements for contractual obligations\n\nWe believe our balances of cash and cash equivalents of $9.25 billion and time deposits of $964 million as of December 31, 2021, along  with  cash  generated  by  ongoing  operations  and  continued  access  to  debt  markets,  will  be  sufficient  to  satisfy  our  cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\nWe have committed cash outflow related to postretirement benefit obligations, long-term debt and operating lease agreements. See Notes 12, 14 and 20, respectively, of Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for additional information.\n\nWe have short-term obligations related to the purchase of goods and services made in the ordinary course of business. These consist of invoices received and recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2021, but scheduled for payment in 2022 of $8.15 billion. In addition,  we  have  contractual  obligations  for  material  and  services  on  order  at  December  31,  2021,  but  not  yet  invoiced  or delivered, of $7.28 billion.\n\nWe also have long-term contractual obligations primarily for logistics services agreements; systems support, software licenses and development  contracts;  information  technology  consulting  contracts  and  outsourcing  contracts  for  benefit  plan  administration. These obligations total $1.16 billion, with $550 million due in the next 12 months.\n\n## Machinery, Energy &amp; Transportation\n\nNet  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  was  $7.18  billion  in  2021,  compared  with  $4.05  billion  in  2020.  The  increase  was primarily  due  to  higher  profit  in  2021  adjusted  for  non-cash  items,  which  included  higher  accruals  for  short-term  incentive compensation. In addition, lower payments for short-term incentive compensation favorably impacted cash flow. Partially offsetting these items were increased working capital requirements. Within working capital, changes in inventory and accounts receivable unfavorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\n\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2021 was $1.23 billion, compared with net cash used of $1.34 billion in 2020. The change was  primarily  due  to  increased  activity  related  to  intercompany  lending  with  Financial  Products,  mostly  offset  by  increased investments in securities. During 2021, we invested $1.19 billion in bank time deposits with varying maturity dates within one year and received proceeds from time deposits that matured of $225 million. We also acquired the Oil &amp; Gas division of the Weir Group PLC for $359 million, net of cash acquired in February 2021.\n\nNet cash used for financing activities during 2021 was $6.30 billion, compared with net cash used of $1.18 billion in 2020. The change was primarily due to the repayment of debt and lower proceeds from the issuance of debt. In addition, we repurchased $2.67 billion of Caterpillar common stock in 2021 compared to $1.13 billion in 2020.",

      "question": "How did General Dynamics' revenue mix shift between 2022 and 2024 in relation to the John Lewis-class Fleet Replenishment Oiler program at NASSCO, and what does this indicate about the evolving strategic focus of GD's Marine Systems segment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GD's Marine Systems segment reported $10.8 billion in expected revenue, with the John Lewis-class (T-AO-205) fleet replenishment oiler program identified as a key contributor alongside the Columbia-class submarine and DDG-51 destroyer programs. NASSCO, which builds the John Lewis-class oilers, was positioned as one of GD's three shipyards but was not highlighted as a strategic growth engine. By 2024, while the John Lewis-class deliveries were still ongoing (planned into 2025), GD's narrative had shifted significantly \u2014 with NASSCO now positioned within a Marine Systems segment that was described as the 'leading designer and builder of nuclear-powered submarines' and a 'leader in surface combatant and auxiliary ship design.' The segment had made 'substantial investments' to expand capacity, particularly for submarines, which were labeled the Navy\u2019s 'top acquisition priority.' This indicates that while the John Lewis-class program remained active, GD's strategic focus had evolved to prioritize submarine production, especially the $125+ billion Columbia-class program, suggesting a shift in revenue mix toward higher-priority, long-duration defense programs at the expense of more routine auxiliary shipbuilding.",

      "question": "How did the continued factory disruptions in 2022, which led to a $402 million increase in losses on the KC-46A Tanker program, influence the financial risk and audit scrutiny around Boeing's fixed-price development contracts in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing faced continued factory and supply chain disruptions, including the impact of COVID-19, which led to a $402 million increase in losses on the KC-46A Tanker program due to higher costs for the Remote Vision System and production delays. These disruptions contributed to the financial risk associated with Boeing's fixed-price development contracts. By 2023, this risk had evolved into heightened audit scrutiny, particularly around the estimation of costs and margins for long-term contracts like the KC-46A Tanker. Auditors emphasized the operational and technical complexities of these contracts, compounded by ongoing supply chain and labor disruptions, which made cost estimation highly uncertain and increased the likelihood of reach-forward losses. This scrutiny reflected a direct continuation of the challenges that originated with disruptions in 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Revenues\n\nBDS revenues in 2021 increased by $283 million compared with 2020 primarily due to higher revenue on the KC-46A Tanker program due to new orders for 27 aircraft received during the first quarter of 2021 and lower charges in 2021. This was partially offset by lower revenues on rotorcraft programs, Commercial Crew and VC-25B. Cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2021 were $56 million less unfavorable than the prior year, largely due to the lower charges described below.\n\nBDS revenues in 2020 increased by $162 million compared with 2019 reflecting higher revenues from fighter aircraft, Space Launch System, B-52 upgrades, proprietary and MQ-25, partially offset by reduced volume in missile defense. These net increases were offset by the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $312 million  higher  than  the  comparable  period  in  the  prior  year,  largely  due  to  the  KC-46A Tanker  charges  during 2020.\n\n## Earnings From Operations\n\nBDS earnings from operations in 2021 increased by $5 million compared with 2020 primarily due to less unfavorable impacts from cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which improved $219 million from the prior year, largely due to lower KC-46A Tanker charges in 2021 compared to 2020 and other charges in development programs described below. The favorable change in cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was offset primarily by lower volume and mix on rotorcraft programs and lower equity earnings for United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nDuring  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  increased  the  reach-forward  loss  on  the  KC-46A  Tanker  program  by $402 million primarily due to continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved.  In  2020,  we  recorded  an  additional  reach-forward  loss  of  $1,320  million  on  the  KC-46A  Tanker  program reflecting $551 million of costs associated",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting party  may  modify,  curtail  or  terminate  its  contracts  and  subcontracts  with  us,  without  prior  notice  and  either  at  its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such  as  'continuing  resolutions'  rather  than  full-year  appropriations.  Any  loss  or  anticipated  loss  or  reduction  of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable  under  U.S.  government  contracts. U.S.  government  agencies,  including  the  Defense  Contract  Audit Agency  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency,  routinely  audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.\n\n## We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.\n\nOur BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 68% and 69% of their 2021 revenues from fixed-price contracts.  While  fixed-price  contracts  enable  us  to  benefit  from  performance  improvements,  cost  reductions  and efficiencies,  they  also  subject  us  to  the  risk  of  reduced  margins  or  incurring  losses  if  we  are  unable  to  achieve estimated costs and revenues. In addition, increased compliance costs and costs due to loss of productivity due to COVID-19 may not be reimbursed. If  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  price,  we  recognize  reach-forward losses  which  can  significantly  affect  our  reported  results.  For  example  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  recorded additional losses of $402 million on the KC-46A Tanker contract reflecting continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the  process  of  estimating  costs  and  revenues  on  fixed-price  contracts  inherently  risky.  Fixed-price  contracts  often contain  price  incentives  and  penalties  tied  to  performance,  which  can  be  difficult  to  estimate  and  have  significant impacts  on  margins.  In  addition,  some  of  our  contracts  have  specific  provisions  relating  to  cost,  schedule  and performance.\n\nFixed-price  development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  Examples  of  significant  BDS  fixed-price  development  contracts include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military satellites.",

      "answer": "In 2023, UPS satisfied the FIP requirements for the Western Pennsylvania Teamsters and Employers Pension Fund, which was in the red zone, contributing $46 million. In 2024, despite the fund remaining in the red zone, UPS slightly reduced its contribution to $45 million, indicating that the prior year's compliance did not result in an increased funding obligation in the following year. This suggests that UPS's 2023 contributions met the FIP-imposed obligations without triggering additional liabilities in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS(2023) \u2192 FIP Requirements: UPS satisfied the FIP requirements for red zone pension funds, including the Western Pennsylvania Teamsters and Employers Pension Fund, contributing $46 million in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: FIP Requirements \u2192 Western Pennsylvania Teamsters and Employers Pension Fund: The fund was subject to FIP requirements due to its red zone status, which mandated UPS to meet specific contribution levels.",
        "Hop 3: Western Pennsylvania Teamsters and Employers Pension Fund \u2190 UPS(2024): UPS contributed $45 million in 2024 to the same fund, which remained in the red zone, showing a slight decrease from the 2023 contribution."

      "answer": "In 2022, GD reported that the John Lewis-class fleet replenishment oiler program was part of the increased Navy ship construction revenue, with deliveries planned into 2025. NASSCO, as the builder of the T-AO-205 class, was positioned as a key contributor to auxiliary ship production within the Marine Systems segment. By 2023, GD's 10-K emphasized a strategic pivot toward high-priority submarine programs like the Columbia- and Virginia-class, with NASSCO's role increasingly focused on supporting auxiliary and Jones Act commercial vessels rather than expanding into new combatant classes. This shift aligned with GD's broader strategy of allocating capital to facility expansions and workforce development at Electric Boat, signaling a reallocation of resources and strategic emphasis away from surface auxiliary programs like the John Lewis-class toward nuclear-powered submarine dominance.",

These increases were offset partially by delivery of our last  commercial  containership  in  backlog  in  2020  and  lower  volume  on  the  Columbia-class  design  contract. Overall, the Marine Systems segment's operating margin decreased 30 basis points in 2021, reflecting the shift in mix to early work on new submarine programs with typical lower initial profit rates.\n\n## 2022 Outlook\n\nWe expect the Marine Systems segment's 2022 revenue to be approximately $10.8 billion. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 8.6% as each shipyard continues to come down the learning curve on their major construction programs.\n\n## COMBAT SYSTEMS\n\n",

Also, projections of any ev aluation of effectiv eness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) inv olv ed our especially challenging, subjectiv e, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, prov iding separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Sufficiency of Audit Evidence over Net Sales\n\nAs discussed in Notes 1, 2 and 20 to the Company's consolidated financial statements, and disclosed in the consolidated statement of earnings, the Company recorded $17.5 billion of net sales in 2024.\n\nWe identified the ev aluation of the sufficiency of audit ev idence ov er net sales as a critical audit matter. Net sales are recognized primarily from the sale of tangible products from hundreds of Company locations around the world. Ev aluating the sufficiency of audit ev idence obtained required especially subjectiv e auditor judgment because of the geographical dispersion of the Company's net sales generating activ ities. This included determining the Company locations at which procedures were performed and the superv ision and rev iew of procedures performed at those locations.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed ov er net sales, including the determination of the Company locations at which those procedures were to be performed. At each Company location where procedures were performed, we:\n\n- Evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiv eness of certain internal controls ov er the Company's net sales processes, including the Company's controls ov er the accurate recording of amounts.\n- Assessed the recorded net sales by selecting a sample of transactions and compared the amounts recognized for consistency with underlying documentation, including contracts with customers and shipping documentation.\n\n## Evaluation of the Acquisition Date Fair Value of Certain Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nAs discussed in Notes 4 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, on October 11, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of National Instruments Corporation for a total purchase consideration of $8.7 billion. The estimated intangible assets attributable to the transactions included customer relationships and dev eloped technology intangible assets with acquisition date fair v alues of $3.36 billion and $1.57 billion, respectiv ely.\n\nWe identified the ev aluation of the acquisition date fair v alue of the customer relationships and dev eloped     technology intangible assets as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjectiv e and complex auditor judgment was required to ev aluate key assumptions used to v alue these acquired intangible assets. Specifically, key assumptions included projected rev enue and customer attrition for the customer relationships intangible asset and projected rev enue and obsolescence rates for the dev eloped technology intangible asset. Changes to these assumptions could have had a significant impact on the fair v alue of such assets. In addition,",

      "question": "How did Emerson's application of the acquisition method in accounting for the Heritage AspenTech transaction in 2022 influence its 2024 goodwill impairment testing methodology, particularly in relation to the $5.9 billion noncontrolling interest and the use of Level 3 fair value estimates?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Emerson applied the acquisition method to account for the Heritage AspenTech transaction, which required the company to record the net assets of AspenTech at their estimated fair value. This included recognizing a $5.9 billion noncontrolling interest for the 45% ownership stake retained by former AspenTech stockholders. This fair value measurement became foundational for subsequent reporting, including goodwill and intangible asset valuations. By 2024, Emerson continued to use the acquisition method framework for goodwill impairment testing, which required estimating the fair value of reporting units using Level 3 inputs\u2014unobservable data that often rely on internal assumptions. The initial fair value assumptions made in 2022 for AspenTech's assets and liabilities, including the noncontrolling interest, directly informed the basis for 2024's impairment tests, making the earlier valuation critical to determining whether any goodwill write-downs were necessary.",

      "question": "How did GE's exposure to UFLIC's structured settlement annuities change from 2022 to 2024, and what does this reveal about shifts in the company's risk management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GE expressed concerns about UFLIC's solvency risks, particularly in relation to Genworth's financial health and the potential adverse effects on UFLIC's capital position and trust assets. Specifically, Genworth had stated that proceeds from its contingency plan would be used to repay parent company debt rather than bolster its insurance subsidiaries\u2019 capital, raising concerns about UFLIC\u2019s exposure and GE\u2019s potential liabilities (GE 2022 10-K). By 2024, GE\u2019s 10-K revealed that UFLIC reinsured approximately 23,400 structured settlement annuities, with 27% underwritten on impaired lives and projected to pay out over decades. These contracts were noted to carry significant risks, including mortality longevity and reinvestment risk in a low-interest-rate environment. The shift from a focus on solvency concerns in 2022 to detailed liability characteristics in 2024 indicates that GE moved from monitoring external risks (Genworth\u2019s capital decisions) to actively managing long-term liabilities tied to UFLIC\u2019s structured settlement annuities, reflecting a strategic pivot toward internal risk mitigation and capital planning for prolonged payout obligations.",

          "chunk_text": "capital markets, and a significant downgrade could have an adverse commercial impact on our businesses. In addition, swap, forward and option contracts are executed under standard master agreements that typically contain mutual downgrade provisions that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the credit ratings of the applicable GE entity were to fall below specified ratings levels agreed upon with the counterparty. For additional discussion about our current credit ratings and related considerations, refer to the Capital Resources and Liquidity - Credit Ratings and Conditions section within MD&amp;A.\n\nFinancial services operations - We continue to have exposure to insurance, credit, legal and other risks in our financial services operations and, in the event of future adverse developments, may not be able to meet our business and financial objectives without further actions or additional capital contributions . To fund the statutory capital contributions that we expect to make to our insurance subsidiaries over the next several years, as well as to meet our debt maturities and other obligations, we expect to rely on liquidity from our operations. There is a risk that future adverse developments could cause liquidity or funding stress. For example, it is possible that future requirements for capital contributions to the insurance subsidiaries will be greater than currently estimated or could be accelerated by regulators. Our annual testing of insurance reserves is subject to a variety of assumptions, including assumptions about the discount rate (which is sensitive to changes in market interest rates), morbidity, mortality and future long-term care premium increases. Any future adverse changes to these assumptions (to the extent not offset by any favorable changes to these assumptions) could result in an increase to future policy benefit reserves and, potentially, to the amount of capital we are required to contribute to the insurance subsidiaries (as discussed in the Other Items - Insurance section within MD&amp;A). We also anticipate that the new insurance accounting standard scheduled to be effective on January 1, 2023 (as discussed in the Other Items - New Accounting Standards section within MD&amp;A) will materially affect our financial statements and require changes to certain of our processes, systems, and controls. In addition, we continue to evaluate strategic options to accelerate the further reduction in the size of our financial services operations. Some of these options could have a material financial charge or other adverse effects depending on the timing, negotiated terms and conditions of any ultimate arrangements. It is also possible that contingent liabilities and loss estimates from our financial services-related continuing or discontinued operations, such as those related to Bank BPH (see Note 22), will need to be recognized or increase in the future and will become payable. There can be no assurance that future liabilities, losses or impairments to the carrying value of assets within our financial services operations would not materially and adversely affect GE's business, financial position, cash flows, results of operations or capacity to provide financing to support orders at the businesses.\n\nCustomers &amp; counterparties - Global economic, industry-specific or other developments that weaken the soundness of significant customers, governments, financial institutions or other parties we deal with can adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. The business and operating results of our businesses have been, and will continue to be, affected by worldwide economic conditions, including conditions in the air transportation, power generation, renewable energy, healthcare and other industries we serve. Existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services, including large infrastructure projects, and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all as a result of business deterioration, cash flow shortages or difficulty obtaining financing for particular projects or due to macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical disruptions, changes in law or other challenges affecting the strength of the global economy. The airline industry, for example, is highly cyclical, and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the U.S. and international economies. Aviation industry activity is also particularly influenced by a small group of large original equipment manufacturers, as well as large airlines in various geographies, and our credit exposure to some of our largest aviation customers is significant. As described above, the current extended disruption of regional and international air travel from the COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our airframer and airline customers. A potential future disruption in connection with a terrorist incident, cyberattack, actual or threatened public health emergency or recessionary economic environment that results in the loss of business and leisure traffic could also adversely affect these customers, their ability to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all, demand for our products and services and the viability of a customer's business. Secular, cyclical or other pressures facing customers across our energy businesses, including in connection with decarbonization, industry consolidation and competition and shifts in the availability of financing for certain types of power projects or technologies (such as prohibitions on financing for fossil fuel-based projects or technologies), can also have a significant impact on the operating results and outlooks for our businesses operating in those industries. Our financial services operations also have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, including customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging markets, and we transact with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit and other risks in the event of insolvency or other default of its counterparty or client. For example, a portion of our run-off insurance operations' assets are held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts. For UFLIC, such trust assets are currently held in trusts for the benefit of insurance company subsidiaries of Genworth, which during 2021 publicly stated any proceeds from its contingency plan will be used to repay parent company debt and not bolster the capital position of its insurance subsidiaries. Solvency or other concerns about Genworth or its insurance company subsidiaries may cause those subsidiaries or their regulators to take or attempt to take actions that could adversely affect UFLIC, including control over assets in the relevant trusts. In addition, our customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. federal government and state and local entities. We also at times face greater challenges collecting on receivables with customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging markets. If there is significant deterioration in the global economy, in our industries, in financial markets or with particular significant counterparties, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n\nPostretirement benefit plans - Increases in pension, healthcare and life insurance benefits obligations and costs can adversely affect our earnings , cash flows and further progress toward our leverage goals . Our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations, which reflect assumptions about financial markets, interest rates and other economic conditions such as the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

Refer to the Other Items - Insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimates and assumptions in our insurance reserves and their sensitivity to change. See Notes 1 and 12 for further information.\n\nPENSION ASSUMPTIONS. Refer to Note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nINCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017, substantially all of our unrepatriated net earnings have been subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without significant additional tax cost. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. M ost of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which rely on reasonable estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. A mounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of this, an insignificant amount and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our GE V ernova, GE HealthCare and legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information - Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and 15 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental, health and safety matters, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, government contracts, employee benefit plans, product quality guarantees and losses resulting from other events and developments. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace products is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these products may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. M oreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\n## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumed long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumed long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc. (Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. Presented in the table below are reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(a)    Pending completion of our December 31, 2024 statutory reporting process.\n\nStructured settlement annuities. We reinsure approximately 23,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 57. A pproximately 27% of these structured settlement annuities were underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than-average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment). Unlike long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nLife Insurance contracts. Our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. A t December 31, 2024, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance portfolio, we reinsure approximately $45 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.1 million policies with an average attained age of 63. In 2024, our incurred claims were approximately $0.4 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $46,100. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20- and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20- and 30-year level term policies, which represent approximately 7% and 43% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2026 and 2035 as the policies reach the end of their 20- and 30-year level premium period, respectively.\n\nCritical Accounting E stimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums and are estimated based on actuarial assumptions such as mortality, morbidity, terminations, and expenses. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings. Our annual review procedures include updating certain experience studies since our last completed review, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. The review of experience and assumptions is a comprehensive and complex process that depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. The review relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance portfolio includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .\n\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value.\n\n- U.S. and Foreign Government Securities : U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities and municipal securities. Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Corporate Debt Instruments : Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Common Stock : Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date.\n- Collective Investment Funds : Collective investment funds consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index. They are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective collective investment funds. The underlying assets are valued based on the net asset value ('NAV'), which is provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCash Flows: Altria makes contributions to the pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax deductible and pays benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. Currently, Altria anticipates making employer contributions to its pension and postretirement plans of up to approximately $30 million for each in 2022. However, the foregoing estimates of 2022 contributions to the pension and postretirement plans are subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, changes in interest rates, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return for each respective plan.\n\nEstimated future benefit payments at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did RTX's FAR-regulated cost accounting practices in 2022 affect their ability to manage contract liabilities arising from the Powder Metal issue in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, RTX was subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which governs cost allowability and payment terms for U.S. government contracts, including progress payments capped at 80-90% of incurred costs. These regulations required RTX to recognize revenue in excess of billings as contract assets, while also managing contract liabilities from advance payments. In 2023, the Powder Metal issue caused a significant increase in labor, material, and customer support costs related to the PW1100 GTF engine inspections. This led to higher-than-anticipated expenses that were subject to FAR-regulated cost allowability reviews, limiting RTX's flexibility in adjusting contract pricing or securing additional funding mid-contract. The FAR\u2019s structured cost accounting framework from 2022 constrained RTX\u2019s ability to rapidly reallocate or recover these escalated costs under existing U.S. government contracts, resulting in increased financial exposure and negatively impacting their 2023 results of operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: RTX(2022) \u2192 FAR: RTX was subject to FAR regulations that dictated cost allowability and payment structures (e.g., progress payments capped at 80-90%) for U.S. government contracts.",
        "Hop 2: FAR \u2192 U.S. Government Contracts: The FAR regulates all aspects of federal contracts, including cost estimation, revenue recognition, and contract liability treatment.",
        "Hop 3: U.S. Government Contracts \u2190 RTX(2023): The Powder Metal issue caused unexpected cost increases in 2023 that were governed by existing FAR-regulated contract terms, limiting RTX\u2019s ability to recover additional expenses."

The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment.  Such  advances  are  not  considered  a  significant  financing  component  because  they  are  used  to  meet  working  capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress, as sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of performing services under the contract is incurred on an other-than-straight-line basis. For some of our long-term aftermarket contracts, we receive payment prior to delivery of products and services, resulting in a contract liability balance, while for others, we deliver products or services in advance of payment, resulting in a contract asset balance.\n\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services that are not distinct are accounted for as part of the existing contract either on a cumulative catch-up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification.\n\nLoss provisions on contracts are recognized to the extent that estimated contract costs exceed the estimated consideration from the products or services contemplated under the contractual arrangement. For new commitments, we generally record loss provisions at contract signing except for certain contracts under which losses are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates us to perform. For existing commitments, anticipated losses on contractual arrangements are recognized in the period in which losses become evident. In estimating losses, products contemplated under contractual arrangements include firm quantities of product sold under contract and, in the commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, future highly probable sales of replacement parts required by regulation that are expected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment. In our commercial engine  and  wheels  and  brakes  businesses,  when  the  OEM  product  is  sold  for  a  loss,  but  the  combined  OEM  and  aftermarket arrangement for each individual sales campaign is profitable, we record OEM product losses at the time of product delivery.\n\nWe review our Estimate at Completion (EACs) on significant contracts on a periodic basis and for others, no less than annually or when  a  change  in  circumstances  warrant  a  modification  to  a  previous  estimate.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  work  required  to  be performed on many of the Company's performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks  and  opportunities  relate  to  management's  judgment  about  the  ability  and  cost  to  achieve  the  schedule,  consideration  of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or  aircraft  landings,  and  related  variable  consideration.  Management's  judgment  related  to  these  considerations  has  become increasingly more significant given the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity  and  scope  of  the  work  to  be  performed,  the  availability  and  cost  of  materials,  the  length  of  time  to  complete  the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives  of  components,  among  others.  Cost  estimates  may  also  include  the  estimated  cost  of  satisfying  our  industrial  cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts primarily within our RIS and RMD",

We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.\n\n## REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS valued its private equity and other alternative investments primarily based on estimated net asset value (NAV), derived from audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers, with adjustments for investment activity through year-end. This approach was subjective and required significant auditor judgment due to the lack of active market pricing. By 2023, UPS continued to use NAV as a practical expedient for valuing these investments, but the company reported specific unfunded commitments totaling $3.3 billion to private equity, private debt, and real estate limited partnerships. These commitments were expected to be funded over the next 3 to 6 years, indicating a strategic continuation and potential expansion of UPS's long-term allocation to illiquid alternative assets. The shift from a focus on valuation estimation in 2022 to the disclosure of concrete unfunded commitments in 2023 reflects greater visibility into UPS's ongoing commitment to these investment classes.",

In order to estimate NAV, the Company evaluates audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers, and makes adjustments, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. These investments are not actively traded, and their values can only be estimated using these subjective assumptions.\n\nAuditing the estimated NAV of these hedge fund, risk parity, private debt, private equity and real estate investments requires a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity to evaluate the completeness, reliability and relevance of the inputs used by management.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the inputs used by management to estimate the NAV of the U.S. Plans' hedge fund, risk parity, private debt, private equity and real estate investments included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls, including those related to the reliability of values reported by fund managers, the relevance of asset class benchmark returns, and the completeness and accuracy of unobservable inputs related to the underlying assets of the funds.\n- For certain investments, we confirmed directly with the respective fund manager its preliminary estimate of the fund's NAV as of December 31, 2021.\n- For certain investments, we inquired of management to understand year-over-year changes in the fund manager's estimate of NAV and compared the fund's return on investment to other available qualitative and quantitative information relevant to the fund.\n- We evaluated the Company's historical ability to accurately estimate NAV for these funds by comparing each fund's recorded valuation as of its prior fiscal year end to the NA V per the audited fund financial statements (which are received in arrears of the Company's reporting timetable).\n\n## Revenue - Refer to Note 2, Revenue Recognition, to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nApproximately 82 percent of the Company's revenues are from its global small package operations that provide time-definite delivery services for express letters, documents, small packages and palletized freight via air and ground services. The Company's global small package revenues are comprised of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions sourced from systems that were primarily developed by the Company. The processing of transactions, including the recording of them, is highly automated and based on contractual terms with the Company's customers.\n\nAuditing global small package revenue required a significant extent of effort and the involvement of professionals with expertise in information technology ('IT') necessary for us to identify, test, and evaluate the Company's systems, software applications and automated controls.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Lockheed Martin's Space segment reported a $80 million decline in equity earnings, primarily due to lower launch volume and increased development costs at ULA (Chunk 1). ULA, in which LMT holds a 50% ownership stake, supplies expendable launch services to both the U.S. government and commercial customers (Chunk 2). By 2024, Lockheed Martin had $665 million in receivables from commercial customers, indicating a continued financial exposure to this market segment (Chunk 3). The drop in ULA earnings suggests potential strain in fulfilling commercial launch contracts, which could have increased credit or delivery risk for LMT with those same commercial customers. However, the filings note no significant credit or impairment losses in 2024, implying that despite the earlier ULA performance issues, LMT maintained sufficient financial control or contractual safeguards to mitigate losses on these receivables.",

      "question": "What does the $600 million decrease in UPS's unfunded commitments to private equity funds between 2023 ($3.3B) and 2024 ($2.7B) suggest about the company's evolving approach to valuing these alternative investments, given that both years specifically rely on fund manager-reported net asset value (NAV) for valuation?",
      "answer": "The $600 million reduction in unfunded commitments from $3.3 billion in 2023 to $2.7 billion in 2024, combined with the consistent use of NAV derived from fund manager reports for valuation in both years, suggests that UPS may be recalibrating its exposure to private equity funds while maintaining the same valuation methodology. This shift could indicate a more cautious stance in capital allocation to these illiquid investments, possibly due to lessons learned from the subjective nature of NAV estimation, as noted in the 2023 audit procedures. Despite the reduction, the continued reliance on NAV highlights the company's ongoing trust in fund manager reporting, albeit with a reduced forward commitment, potentially signaling a strategic shift toward more conservative investment planning in alternative asset classes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS(2023) \u2192 NAV: UPS disclosed that private equity fund investments were valued using NAV derived from fund manager reports, with $3.3 billion in unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Hop 2: NAV \u2192 Private Equity Funds: NAV is used as a practical expedient to value private equity funds due to the lack of readily determinable fair value, with adjustments made for investment activity between reporting periods.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

      "question": "How did the changes in UPS's retirement plan structure between 2022 and 2024, specifically the cessation of benefit accruals in the UPS Retirement Plan and the transition to defined contribution limits under IRS guidelines, affect the company's annual retirement contribution expenses?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UPS maintained the UPS Retirement Plan, a defined benefit plan subject to IRS limits, with retirement contributions charged to expense totaling $83 million. By 2024, the company had ceased accruals for non-union participants in the UPS Retirement Plan effective January 1, 2023, and transitioned to a defined contribution model under the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan. Under this new structure, non-union employees received annual retirement contributions of 5% to 8% of eligible compensation, resulting in retirement contributions charged to expense of $359 million in 2024. This shift from a defined benefit to a defined contribution model, aligned with IRS-prescribed limits, led to a significant increase in retirement expense, reflecting a strategic reallocation of pension liability from the company to employees.",

COMPANY-SPONSORED EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\n\nWe sponsor various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit and defined contribution plans which cover our employees worldwide.\n\n## U.S. Pension Benefits\n\nIn the U.S. we maintain the following single-employer defined benefit pension plans: the UPS Retirement Plan, the UPS Pension Plan, the UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan and the UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan, a non-qualified plan.\n\nThe UPS Retirement Plan is noncontributory and includes substantially all eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries hired prior to July 1, 2016 who are not members of a collective bargaining unit, as well as certain employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on average compensation earned by employees prior to retirement. Benefits payable under this plan are subject to maximum compensation limits and the annual benefit limits for a tax-qualified defined benefit plan as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS').\n\nThe UPS Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes certain eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries and members of collective bargaining units that elect to participate in the plan. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\n\nThe UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes employees that were previously members of the Central States Pension Fund (\"CSPF\"), a multiemployer pension plan, in addition to other eligible employees who are covered under certain collective bargaining agreements. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\n\nThe UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain participants in the UPS Retirement Plan, hired prior to July 1, 2016, for amounts that exceed the benefit limits described above.\n\nThe UPS Retirement Plan and the UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan will cease accruals of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective January 1, 2023.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, certain former U.S. employees were offered the option to receive a one-time payment of their vested pension benefit. Approximately 18,800 former employees accepted this option, accelerating $820 million in benefit payments during 2019 while reducing the number of participants who are due future payments from U.S. pension plans. As the cost of these settlements did not exceed the plans' service cost and interest cost for the year, the impact of the settlement was not recognized in earnings.\n\nOn April 30, 2021, we completed the divestiture of UPS Freight as discussed in note 4. The divestiture triggered an interim remeasurement of certain UPS-sponsored pension and postretirement medical benefit plans under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715- Compensation- Retirement Benefits ('ASC 715'). Accordingly, we remeasured the plan assets and benefit obligations of the UPS Pension Plan, UPS Retirement Plan and UPS Retired Employee Health Care Plan as of April 30, 2021.\n\nThe interim remeasurement resulted in an actuarial gain of $2.1 billion. The actuarial gain reflects a $3.7 billion benefit from a 49 basis point increase in the discount rate compared to December 31, 2020 and a $0.1 billion benefit related to workforce reductions associated with the divestiture, offset by a $1.7 billion loss resulting from actual returns being approximately 430 basis points below expected returns. The $2.1 billion actuarial gain was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. A pre-tax actuarial gain of $69 million ($52 million after tax) was immediately recognized for a prior service credit related to the divested group in the statement of consolidated income for the second quarter. We also amended certain benefit terms within these plans as of April 30, 2021. The amendment to the UPS Pension Plan resulted in the immediate recognition of a $66 million ($50 million after tax) loss in the statement of consolidated income for the second quarter.\n\nThe impacts of the plan remeasurements and plan amendments are included within Other expenses in the statements of consolidated income as components of the divestiture of UPS Freight.",

In addition, many of our international employees are covered by government-sponsored retirement and pension plans. We are not directly responsible for providing benefits to participants of government-sponsored plans.\n\nDuring 2022, we amended certain Canadian defined benefit pension plans to cease future benefit accruals effective December 31, 2023. We remeasured plan assets and benefit obligations for the plans, which resulted in curtailment gains of $34 million ($24 million after tax ).

Generally, this includes employees with at least 10 years of service who have reached age 55 and employees who are eligible for postretirement medical benefits from a company-sponsored plan pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. We have the right to modify or terminate certain of these plans. These benefits have been provided to certain retirees on a noncontributory basis; however, in many cases, retirees are required to contribute all or a portion of the total cost of the coverage.\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nWe sponsor a defined contribution plan for employees not covered under collective bargaining agreements, and several smaller defined contribution plans for certain employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. We match, in cash, a portion of the participating employees' contributions. Matching contributions charged to expense were $161, $161 and $153 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nBeginning in 2023, non-union employees, including those previously accruing benefits in the UPS Retirement Plan, receive an annual retirement contribution of 5% to 8% (3% to 8% prior to 2023 for employees hired after July 1, 2016) of eligible compensation to the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan based on years of vesting service. Effective January 1, 2025, the UPS Retirement Plan contribution for certain non-union employees with an employment commencement date on or after January 1, 2025 is 3% of eligible compensation, regardless of years of vesting service. Retirement contributions charged to expense were $359, $380 and $83 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan provides for transition contributions to certain participants hired prior to 2008. The amounts charged to expense for transition contributions were $108 and $128 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were no transition contributions in years prior to 2023.\n\nContributions under this plan are subject to maximum compensation and contribution limits for a tax-qualified defined contribution plan as prescribed by the IRS. The UPS Restoration Savings Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain participants in the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan for amounts that exceed these benefit limits.\n\nContributions are also made to defined contribution money purchase plans under certain collective bargaining agreements. Amounts charged to expense were $135, $132 and $119 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nWe also sponsor certain international defined contribution plans, which are not individually material.\n\n## Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n\nInformation about net periodic benefit cost for the company-sponsored pension and postretirement defined benefit plans is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

However, the voting rights tied to Class A Common Stock, which previously allowed full voting rights on all matters, now included more defined limitations, particularly in merger scenarios where Class B and C stockholders could vote together as a single class under specific conditions.

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS's Class B common stock (718 shares issued) had 15 votes per share and represented 33\u2153% of the combined voting power, while Class A common stock (147 shares issued) held the remaining voting rights. By 2023, the number of Class B shares slightly decreased to 726, maintaining the same 15-vote structure and 33\u2153% voting power, while Class A shares issued dropped to 127. This consistent yet concentrated voting structure ensured that holders of Class B stock, such as Mr. Brian L. Roberts, retained significant control over corporate decisions despite minor fluctuations in share issuance. The relationship between the two stock classes remained pivotal in shaping governance and decision-making authority across the years.",

In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis.\n\nHolders of Class A common stock in the aggregate hold 66 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock. The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class B common stock having 15 votes per share. The Class B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\nRecord holders as of December 31, 2021 are presented in the table below.\n\n",

      "question": "How did the reduction in the number of structured settlement annuities from 2022 to 2023 impact GE's exposure to reinvestment risk, given the persistent low interest rate environment?",
      "answer": "GE reinsured 27,400 structured settlement annuities in 2022, which decreased to 24,600 in 2023, indicating a reduction in the volume of long-term life-contingent liabilities. This reduction likely lessened GE's exposure to reinvestment risk, which is a key concern in a low interest rate environment where achieving targeted investment margins becomes more challenging. Despite this decline, structured settlement annuities still represent a significant long-duration liability with payments extending decades into the future, maintaining pressure on GE to manage its investment portfolio effectively to meet future obligations.",

        "Hop 2: Reinvestment Risk \u2192 Structured Settlement Annuities: Reinvestment risk is a primary concern for structured settlement annuities, especially in a low interest rate environment, as it limits the ability to generate sufficient returns on reinvested funds.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(a)    Statutory balances reflect recognition of the estimated remaining statutory increase in reserves of approximately $3.6 billion through 2023 under the permitted accounting practice discussed further below and in Note 11 .\n\nStructured settlement annuities and life insurance contracts. We reinsure approximately 27,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 54. These structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-thanaverage life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins). Unlike long- term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nOur life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. As of December 31, 2021, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance blocks, we reinsure approximately $70 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.7 million policies with an average attained age of 60. In 2021, our incurred claims were approximately $0.6 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $50,000. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20 and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20-year level term policies, which represent approximately 25% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2024 as the policies reach the end of their 20-year level premium period.\n\nInvestment portfolio and other adjustments. Our insurance liabilities and annuity benefits are primarily supported by investment securities of $41.6 billion and $42.0 billion and commercial mortgage loans of $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, we expect to purchase approximately $5.5 billion of new assets through 2024 in conjunction with expected capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2022, pending completion of our December 31, 2021 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. Our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and comprise mainly investment-grade debt securities. The portfolio includes $6.7 billion of net unrealized gains that are recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of applicable taxes and other adjustments as of December 31, 2021.\n\nIn calculating our future policy benefit reserves, we are required to consider the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investment securities supporting our insurance contracts as if those unrealized amounts were realized. To the extent that the realization of gains would result in a premium deficiency, an adjustment is recorded to increase future policy benefit reserves with an after-tax offset to Accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2021, $3.4 billion of net unrealized gains on our investment securities required a related increase to future policy benefit reserves. This adjustment decreased from $8.2 billion in 2020 to $3.4 billion in 2021 primarily from the higher margin resulting from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities. See Note 3 for further information about our investment securities.\n\nWe manage the investments in our run-off insurance operations under strict investment guidelines, including limitations on asset class concentration, single issuer exposures, asset-liability duration variances, and other factors to meet credit quality, yield, liquidity and diversification requirements associated with servicing our insurance liabilities under reasonable circumstances. This process includes consideration of various asset allocation strategies and incorporates information from several external investment advisors to improve our investment yield subject to maintaining our ability to satisfy insurance liabilities when due, as well as considering our risk-based capital requirements, regulatory constraints, and tolerance for surplus volatility. With the expected capital contributions through 2024, we intend to further diversify our portfolio, including with non-traditional asset classes such as private equity, senior secured loans and infrastructure debt, among others. Asset allocation planning is a dynamic process that considers changes in market conditions, risk appetite, liquidity needs and other factors which are reviewed on a periodic basis by our investment team. Investing in these assets exposes us to both credit risk (i.e., debtor's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest), interest rate risk (i.e., market price, cash flow variability, and reinvestment risk due to changes in market interest rates) and equity risk (i.e., the risk arising from",

      "answer": "In 2023, FedEx acknowledged its exposure to evolving AI regulations, including the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act and U.S. executive orders, noting that such regulations could require changes to its business model and increase compliance costs (FDX_10k_2023.pdf). By 2024, FedEx responded by investing in AI and machine learning through FedEx Dataworks, which was used to enhance operational efficiency and support the DRIVE transformation program. The company specifically leveraged AI to improve network efficiency under Network 2.0 and to enhance supply chain insights and customer experience (FDX_10k_2024.pdf).

          "chunk_text": "## The  development  and  use  of  AI  present  risks  and  challenges  that may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe or our third-party vendors, clients or counterparties have in the past developed or incorporated, and may in the future develop or incorporate, AI  technology  in  certain  business  processes,  services  or  products.  The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

Our business strategy also provides flexibility in structuring our network to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which the customer operates, allowing us to leverage and manage change. Volatility, uncertainty, and innovation have become the norms in the global transportation market, and we are able to use our flex ibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy.\n\nFor more than 50 years, we built networks that have created a differentiated and unmatched portfolio of services while continuously evolving to meet the changing needs of our customers and the market. With the recent significant growth of e-commerce and as our service mix continues to shift to deferred services, we are continuing to evolve to improve our operational efficiency and enhance profitability through one FedEx, Network 2.0 (our multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada), and DRIVE (our comprehensive program to improve long-term profitability). We are building a simplified experience to better serve our customers with enhanced capabilities and transforming to operate with more flexibility, efficiency, and intelligence.\n\nWe have implemented Network 2.0 in more than 50 locations in the U.S. and began the phased transition of all legacy FedEx Ground operations and personnel in Canada to Federal Express surface operations in April 2024. As we optimize our network under Network 2.0, Federal Express will continue to utilize both employee couriers and contracted service providers in U.S. surface operations using a market-by-market approach. Additionally, in 2024 we announced Tricolor, the redesign of the Federal Express international air network as part of the DRIVE program to improve efficiency and asset utilization. See 'Business Segments' below, 'Item 1A. Risk Factors,' and 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information on one FedEx, Network 2.0, and DRIVE. One FedEx and Network 2.0 will leverage the strength of our networks, people, and assets in more efficient ways, enabling a distinct focus on air and international volume while facilitating a more holistic approach to how we move packages on the ground.\n\nInnovation inspired our start at FedEx over 50 years ago, and it is fueling our future as we combine logistics with digital intelligence. Leveraging the capabilities of FedEx Dataworks, developments in data and technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, are facilitating the execution of our DRIVE transformation by creating new opportunities to improve our operational efficiency. See 'Business Segments' below for more information. The size and scale of our global network gives us key insights into global supply chains and trends. This foundation provides an immense amount of data we can use to build better insights, improve the customer experience, and differentiate our service offerings. To fully harness the power of this data, FedEx Dataworks is focused on putting our data into context and using it to enhance the efficiency of the FedEx network and the end-to-end experience of our customers by making supply chains smarter for everyone.\n\nIn January 2024, we announced fdx, a fully integrated data-driven commerce platform that connects the entire customer journey. See 'Federal Express Segment Customer-Driven Technology - E-Commerce and Digital Solutions' below for more information. In early 2025 we formed a new enterprise-wide Data &amp; Technology team, which is focused on initiatives to streamline the technology used during the package delivery lifecycle; establish global standards across pickup-and-delivery, linehaul, sort, and clearance operations; and improve digital products and experiences for the FedEx enterprise and our customers.\n\n'Safety Above All' is the first and foremost value in every aspect of our business. We are committed to making our workplaces and communities safer for our team members, customers, and the public. This philosophy is embedded in our day-to-day work through rigorous policies, continual education and engagement, and investments in technology designed to prevent accidents.\n\nThrough our global transportation, information technology, and retail networks, we help to facilitate an ongoing and unprecedented expansion of customer access to goods, services, and information. We believe it would be extremely difficult, costly, and time-consuming to replicate our global network, which reflects decades of investment, innovation, and expertise, includes the world's largest all-cargo air fleet, and connects more than 99% of the world's gross domestic product. We continue to position our company and team members to facilitate and capitalize on this access and to achieve stronger long-term growth, productivity, and profitability.\n\nDuring 2024 and early 2025, we introduced and expanded a number of innovative solutions, advanced important long-term business initiatives, and made other important investments that benefit our customers, team members, communities, and other stakeholders, including:\n\n-   Completing our one FedEx consolidation plan to bring FedEx Ground and FedEx Services into Federal Express, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground ex press network.\n-   Continuing DRIVE, our comprehensive program to improve our long-term profitability.\n-   Implementing Network 2.0 in more than 50 locations in the U.S. and beginning the phased implementation in Canada.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar identified Volvo Construction Equipment as a global competitor in the construction machinery sector, with both companies offering a broad range of products such as excavators, loaders, and compactors. By 2024, Volvo had formed a joint venture with Shandong Lingong Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. (SDLG), a regional competitor in China that directly competed with Caterpillar. This shift meant that Caterpillar, which previously competed with Volvo on a global scale, now faced a new competitive threat from a locally entrenched player (SDLG) that had gained access to Volvo\u2019s technology and resources through the JV. This evolution likely altered Caterpillar\u2019s market strategy in China, as SDLG was positioned to offer competitive products tailored to regional preferences, potentially impacting Caterpillar\u2019s market share and requiring strategic adjustments to maintain its position in the region.",

      "question": "How did the change in the number of issued shares of UPS's Class A Common Stock from 2023 to 2024 affect the relative voting power dynamics between Class A and Class B Common Stockholders, and what implications does this have for corporate governance control?",
      "answer": "In 2023, UPS reported 127 shares of Class A Common Stock issued, which decreased to 121 shares in 2024, while Class B Common Stock increased from 726 to 733 shares. According to the evidence, Class A Common Stock collectively holds 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B Common Stock holds 33 1/3%, with each Class B share having 15 votes. The reduction in Class A shares and the increase in Class B shares in 2024 likely concentrated voting power further in favor of the Class B shareholders, such as Mr. Brian L. Roberts, who holds all outstanding Class B shares. This shift may have increased the influence of Class B shareholders over corporate governance decisions, despite the unchanged percentage allocation of voting power.",

By 2024, the number of authorized shares for both classes remained unchanged at 4.6 billion for Class A and 5.6 billion for Class B. However, the continued authorization of Class A shares\u2014primarily held by employees, retirees, and founder-related trusts\u2014suggests ongoing potential for conversion into Class B shares, which are publicly traded.

      "question": "How did the decline in GE's trust assets tied to reinsurance contracts from $31.0 billion in 2022 to $29.8 billion in 2024 reflect changes in the constraints imposed by investment guidelines, and what does this imply about the evolving capital positioning of GE's run-off insurance operations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GE's run-off insurance operations held $31.0 billion in trust assets associated with reinsurance contracts, which were subject to specific investment guidelines outlined in trust agreements. By 2024, this amount had decreased to $29.8 billion. The investment guidelines continued to govern these trust assets, specifying that they were held by independent trustees for the benefit of ceding insurers. However, some trust agreements allowed ceding companies to withdraw assets and hold them on their own balance sheets, potentially exercising investment control. The reduction in trust assets may reflect either asset withdrawals by ceding companies or changes in market valuations, suggesting a shift in how these assets are being managed or positioned. This decline, combined with the flexibility granted by the investment guidelines, implies a potential strategic or regulatory-driven adjustment in the capital positioning of GE\u2019s run-off insurance operations, particularly as it relates to the liquidity and control of trust assets held for reinsurance purposes.",

In addition, swap, forward and option contracts are executed under standard master agreements that typically contain mutual downgrade provisions that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the credit ratings of the applicable GE entity were to fall below specified ratings levels agreed upon with the counterparty. For additional discussion about our current credit ratings and related considerations, refer to the Capital Resources and Liquidity - Credit Ratings and Conditions section within MD&amp;A.\n\nFinancial services operations - We continue to have exposure to insurance, credit, legal and other risks in our financial services operations and, in the event of future adverse developments, may not be able to meet our business and financial objectives without further actions or additional capital contributions . To fund the statutory capital contributions that we expect to make to our insurance subsidiaries over the next several years, as well as to meet our debt maturities and other obligations, we expect to rely on liquidity from our operations. There is a risk that future adverse developments could cause liquidity or funding stress. For example, it is possible that future requirements for capital contributions to the insurance subsidiaries will be greater than currently estimated or could be accelerated by regulators. Our annual testing of insurance reserves is subject to a variety of assumptions, including assumptions about the discount rate (which is sensitive to changes in market interest rates), morbidity, mortality and future long-term care premium increases. Any future adverse changes to these assumptions (to the extent not offset by any favorable changes to these assumptions) could result in an increase to future policy benefit reserves and, potentially, to the amount of capital we are required to contribute to the insurance subsidiaries (as discussed in the Other Items - Insurance section within MD&amp;A). We also anticipate that the new insurance accounting standard scheduled to be effective on January 1, 2023 (as discussed in the Other Items - New Accounting Standards section within MD&amp;A) will materially affect our financial statements and require changes to certain of our processes, systems, and controls. In addition, we continue to evaluate strategic options to accelerate the further reduction in the size of our financial services operations. Some of these options could have a material financial charge or other adverse effects depending on the timing, negotiated terms and conditions of any ultimate arrangements. It is also possible that contingent liabilities and loss estimates from our financial services-related continuing or discontinued operations, such as those related to Bank BPH (see Note 22), will need to be recognized or increase in the future and will become payable. There can be no assurance that future liabilities, losses or impairments to the carrying value of assets within our financial services operations would not materially and adversely affect GE's business, financial position, cash flows, results of operations or capacity to provide financing to support orders at the businesses.\n\nCustomers &amp; counterparties - Global economic, industry-specific or other developments that weaken the soundness of significant customers, governments, financial institutions or other parties we deal with can adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. The business and operating results of our businesses have been, and will continue to be, affected by worldwide economic conditions, including conditions in the air transportation, power generation, renewable energy, healthcare and other industries we serve. Existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services, including large infrastructure projects, and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all as a result of business deterioration, cash flow shortages or difficulty obtaining financing for particular projects or due to macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical disruptions, changes in law or other challenges affecting the strength of the global economy. The airline industry, for example, is highly cyclical, and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the U.S. and international economies. Aviation industry activity is also particularly influenced by a small group of large original equipment manufacturers, as well as large airlines in various geographies, and our credit exposure to some of our largest aviation customers is significant. As described above, the current extended disruption of regional and international air travel from the COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our airframer and airline customers. A potential future disruption in connection with a terrorist incident, cyberattack, actual or threatened public health emergency or recessionary economic environment that results in the loss of business and leisure traffic could also adversely affect these customers, their ability to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all, demand for our products and services and the viability of a customer's business. Secular, cyclical or other pressures facing customers across our energy businesses, including in connection with decarbonization, industry consolidation and competition and shifts in the availability of financing for certain types of power projects or technologies (such as prohibitions on financing for fossil fuel-based projects or technologies), can also have a significant impact on the operating results and outlooks for our businesses operating in those industries. Our financial services operations also have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, including customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging markets, and we transact with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit and other risks in the event of insolvency or other default of its counterparty or client. For example, a portion of our run-off insurance operations' assets are held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts. For UFLIC, such trust assets are currently held in trusts for the benefit of insurance company subsidiaries of Genworth, which during 2021 publicly stated any proceeds from its contingency plan will be used to repay parent company debt and not bolster the capital position of its insurance subsidiaries. Solvency or other concerns about Genworth or its insurance company subsidiaries may cause those subsidiaries or their regulators to take or attempt to take actions that could adversely affect UFLIC, including control over assets in the relevant trusts. In addition, our customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. federal government and state and local entities. We also at times face greater challenges collecting on receivables with customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging markets. If there is significant deterioration in the global economy, in our industries, in financial markets or with particular significant counterparties, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n\nPostretirement benefit plans - Increases in pension, healthcare and life insurance benefits obligations and costs can adversely affect our earnings , cash flows and further progress toward our leverage goals . Our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations, which reflect assumptions about financial markets, interest rates and other economic conditions such as the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

Assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contracts and trust agreements. Some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of ERAC or UFLIC which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates and benefit utilization rates); morbidity improvement (i.e., assumed rate of improvement in morbidity in the future); mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force); anticipated premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, including actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2030, on long-term care insurance policies; and interest rates. Assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.\n\nClaim reserves . Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. Key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. Claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.\n\nReinsurance recoverables . We cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies, and record receivables for estimated recoveries as we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholders or cedents. These receivables are estimated in a manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves. Reserves ceded to reinsurers, net of allowance, were $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in the caption All other assets in our Statement of Financial Position.\n\nPremium Deficiency Testing . We annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. The premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. A comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. Premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nThe primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include:\n\nMorbidity . Morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. For long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last). Prior to 2017, premium deficiency assumptions considered the risk of anti-selection by including issue age adjustments to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long-term care policies issued to younger individuals would exhibit lower expected incidences and claim costs than those issued to older policyholders. Recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curves indicated issue age differences had minimal impact on claim cost projections, and, accordingly, beginning in 2017, issue age adjustments were eliminated in developing morbidity assumptions. Higher morbidity increases, while lower morbidity decreases, the present value of expected future benefit payments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, RTX (via Pratt & Whitney) was producing the PW1100G-JM engine, a key member of the GTF engine family, which powers the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. This engine was central to Pratt & Whitney\u2019s commercial engine business, which had a major customer in Airbus, representing 31% of total Pratt & Whitney segment sales. By 2024, RTX had restructured its collaboration arrangements, with Pratt & Whitney now holding a 59% ownership interest in IAE LLC, the entity coordinating the PW1100G-JM engine program. RTX's net program share interest in IAE LLC was 51%, indicating a shift in collaboration economics. This change in ownership structure likely altered cost-sharing dynamics and risk allocation for the PW1100G-JM engine program, directly influencing its production economics. The increased control through a larger stake may have allowed RTX to better align program execution with its strategic goals, though it also exposed the company to a greater share of program risks and costs.",

Collins Aerospace continued its significant product development activities, including for major systems on the A321XLR, the Boeing 777X, the Irkut MC-21, the Dassault 6X Falcon, and the Xian MA700,  as  well  as  systems  in  support  of  the  Boeing  T-7A  trainer  and  the  Boeing  VC-25B.  Collins  Aerospace  also  received numerous  contract  awards  for  buyer-furnished  equipment  installation  for  interiors,  avionics,  and  wheels  and  brakes,  and strategically important contract awards for its FlightSense\u00ae full life-cycle support services. In November 2021, Collins Aerospace completed its previously announced acquisition of FlightAware, a digital aviation company that operates flight tracking and data platforms. In 2021, Collins Aerospace's F-16 Performance Base Logistics (PBL) program won the Secretary of Defense PBL-ofthe-year award.\n\nPratt &amp; Whitney. Pratt &amp; Whitney is among the world's leading suppliers of aircraft engines for commercial, military, business jet and general aviation customers. Pratt &amp; Whitney's Commercial Engines and Military Engines businesses design, develop, produce and maintain families of large engines for wide- and narrow-body and large regional aircraft for commercial customers and for fighter,  bomber, tanker and transport aircraft for military customers. Pratt &amp; Whitney's small engine business, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada (P&amp;WC), is among the world's leading suppliers of engines powering regional airlines, general and business aviation, as well  as  helicopters.  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney  also  produces,  sells  and  services  military  and  commercial  auxiliary  power  units.  Pratt  &amp; Whitney provides fleet management services and aftermarket maintenance, repair and overhaul services in all of these segments.\n\nPratt  &amp;  Whitney  sells  products  and  services  principally  to  aircraft  manufacturers,  airlines  and  other  aircraft  operators,  aircraft leasing companies and the U.S. and foreign governments. Pratt &amp; Whitney's largest commercial customer by sales is Airbus, with sales, prior to discounts and incentives, of 31%, 30% and 31% of total Pratt &amp; Whitney segment sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nPratt &amp; Whitney produces the PW1000G Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine family, the first of which, the PW1100G-JM, entered into service in January 2016. The PW1000G GTF engine has demonstrated a significant reduction in fuel burn and noise levels and lower environmental emissions when compared to legacy engines. The PW1100G-JM engine is offered on the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. PW1000G GTF engine models also power the Airbus A220 passenger aircraft and Embraer's E-Jet E2 family of aircraft and have been certified by the Russian civil aviation authority to power the Irkut MC-21 passenger aircraft. In addition, P&amp;WC's PW800 engine has been selected to exclusively power Gulfstream's G400, G500 and G600 business jets, as well as to power Dassault's Falcon 6X business jet, which is scheduled to enter into service in 2022.\n\nPratt &amp; Whitney is under contract to produce and sustain the F135 engine for the U.S. government's F-35 Joint Program Office to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft (commonly known as the Joint Strike Fighter) produced by Lockheed Martin. F135 propulsion system configurations are used for the U.S Air Force's F-35A, the U.S. Marine Corps' F-35B and the U.S. Navy's F-35C jets. F135 engines are also used on F-35 aircraft purchased by Joint Strike Fighter partner countries and other countries through foreign military sales arrangements. Pratt &amp; Whitney is also under contract to build engines for the U.S. Air Force's B-21 long-range strike bomber and to develop next-generation adaptive engines for the U.S. Air Force.\n\nThe development of new engines and improvements to current production engines present important growth opportunities for Pratt &amp; Whitney. In view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines, Pratt &amp; Whitney has entered into collaboration arrangements in which revenues, costs and risks are shared with third parties. At December 31, 2021, the interests of third-party collaboration participants in Pratt &amp; Whitney-directed jet engine programs ranged, in the aggregate per program, from 13% to 49%. See 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of our  accounting  for  collaboration  arrangements.  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney  also  continues  to  enhance  its  programs  through  performance improvement measures and product base expansion, utilizing similar collaboration arrangements.\n\nIn  2021,  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney  reached  significant  milestones  on  the  GTF  engine  program,  including  the  first  flight  of  the  GTF Advantage engine for the A320neo family. The GTF Advantage configuration further extends the economic and environmental benefits of the existing GTF engine, as it reduces fuel consumption by an additional 1 percent, extending the engine's lead as the most efficient powerplant for the A320neo family. The GTF family now powers more than 1,100 aircraft across 58 airlines and three  aircraft  platforms: Airbus A320neo  family, Airbus A220  and  Embraer  E-Jets  E2. Also  in  2021,  Pratt  &amp; Whitney's V2500 program achieved 250 million flight hours. Pratt &amp; Whitney was announced as the engine provider on the Dassault Falcon 6X and Gulfstream  G400,  representing  two  new  platforms  for  its  PW800  engine.  In  addition,  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney  received  a  significant number of contract awards for the F135 program, which powers all three variants of the F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft and achieved several F135 production milestones, including the delivery of the 800th production engine and continuing to add more F135 engine maintenance, repair, overhaul and upgrade (MRO&amp;U) global capacity by activating MRO&amp;U facilities, or depots, in the Netherlands and Australia. Significant activity continued on development programs, including testing the first XA101 engine as part of the Adaptive Engine Transition Program.",

As previously  announced,  in  2024  the  Company  resolved  several  outstanding  legal  matters,  herein  referred  to  as  'Resolution  of  Certain  Legal Matters.'  The  Company  entered  into  a  deferred  prosecution  agreement  (DPA)  (DPA-1)  with  the  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ)  and  the  Company  settled  an administrative proceeding with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (the SEC Administrative Order) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS), in connection with certain Middle East contracts since 2012 (Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters). The Company also entered into a DPA and a False Claims Act (FCA) settlement agreement with  the  DOJ  to  resolve  previously  disclosed  criminal  and  civil  government  investigations  into  defective  pricing  claims  for  certain  legacy  Raytheon  Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017 (DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes). Under these DPAs and the SEC Administrative Order, Raytheon Company and the Company are required to retain, among other things, an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending  three  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  monitor  is  engaged)  and  are  required  to  undertake  certain  cooperation  and  disclosure  obligations  (for  a  term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The  compliance  monitor  will  oversee  Raytheon  Company's  and  the  Company's  compliance  with  their  respective  obligations  under  the  DPAs  and  the  SEC Administrative  Order.  The  DPAs further provide that, in the event the  DOJ, in its sole discretion, determines during the period of deferral of prosecution that Raytheon Company or the Company have violated any provision of either DPA, Raytheon Company or the Company may be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation, including the charges against Raytheon Company in the relevant DPA. The SEC Administrative Order further provides that, in the event of a breach of the SEC Administrative Order, the SEC may vacate the SEC Administrative Order and institute proceedings against the Company. In the event of any such determination  or  breach,  the  Company  may  face  additional  adverse  impacts.  In  addition,  the  Company  resolved  certain  voluntarily  disclosed  ex port  controls violations primarily identified in connection with the integration of Rockwell Collins and, to a lesser ex tent, Raytheon Company, including certain violations that were resolved pursuant to a Consent Agreement (CA) with the Department of State (DOS) (Trade Compliance Matters). The CA, which has a three-year term, requires the Company  to  implement  remedial  compliance  measures  and  to  conduct  an  external  audit  of  the  Company's  International  Traffic  in  Arms  Regulations  (ITAR) compliance program. The CA also requires appointment of an external, independent Special Compliance Officer (SCO). The Company appointed its SCO on September 27, 2024. As a result of the DPAs, SEC Administrative Order, FCA settlement agreement and CA, we recorded a combined pre-tax charge of $918 million during the second quarter of 2024, which included $269 million related to the DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes (in addition to amounts previously accrued), $364 million related to Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters (in addition to amounts previously accrued), and $285 million related to Trade Compliance Matters. In the fourth quarter we made payments of $580 million related to the DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Dispute and $384 million related to Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters. See 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nPratt &amp; Whitney Powder Metal Matter. In 2023, Pratt &amp; Whitney determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the PW1100G -JM (PW1100) G eared Turbofan (GTF) fleet, which powers the A320neo family of aircraft (A320neo) (herein referred to as the 'Powder Metal Matter'). See 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nGlobal Supply Chain. We are dependent on a global supply chain and have experienced supply chain disruptions that resulted in delays and increased costs and adversely affected our performance. These disruptions impacted our ability to procure raw materials, microelectronics, and certain commodities on a timely basis and/or at expected prices, and are driven by supply chain market constraints and macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and labor market shortages. Current geopolitical  conditions,  including  conflicts  and  other  causes  of  strained  intercountry  relations,  as  well  as  sanctions  and  other  trade  restrictive  activities,  are contributing to these issues. Furthermore, our suppliers and subcontractors have been impacted by these same issues. We have implemented actions and programs to mitigate some of the impacts but anticipate supply chain disruptions to continue.\n\nEconomic Environment. The inflationary environment has increased material and component prices, labor rates, and supplier costs and has negatively impacted our performance, including our productivity expectations. Due to the nature of our government and commercial aerospace businesses, and their respective customer and supplier contracts, we are not always able to offset cost increases by increasing our contract value or pricing, in particular on our fixed-price contracts. Increasing material, component, and labor prices could subject us to losses in our fixed price contracts in the event of cost overruns. In addition, higher interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing and tightened the availability of capital. Among other things, these effects can constrain our customers' purchasing power and decrease orders for our products and services and impact the ability of our customers to make payments and our suppliers to perform. Moreover, volatility in interest rates and financial markets can lead to economic uncertainty, an economic downturn or recession, and impact the demand for our products and services as well as our supply chain. We continue to pursue strategic and operational initiatives to help address these macroeconomic pressures, including our digital transformation, operational modernization, cost reduction, and advanced",

      "answer": "In 2022, RTX faced significant risks tied to U.S. government contract terminations, including the potential for cost overruns, lack of reimbursement for unauthorized costs, and delays in funding due to congressional appropriations. These risks were compounded by the use of fixed-price contracts, where RTX bore the burden of cost overruns. By 2024, RTX's revenue recognition methodology under FAR guidelines evolved to reflect a more structured approach, particularly for long-term defense contracts where revenue was recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis using incurred costs relative to total estimated costs. This shift suggests that RTX adapted its financial planning to better align with FAR's cost-based pricing guidance, likely in response to the earlier risks of contract termination and funding instability. The increased emphasis on cost tracking and progress-based payments in 2024 indicates a strategic response to the volatility observed in 2022.",

Significant changes in U.S. government defense spending or changes in U.S. government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\nWe Face Risks Relating to Our U.S. Government Contracts and the Mix of Our U.S. Government Contracts and Programs that Could Negatively Impact our Financial Condition, Results of Operations, Liquidity and Overall Business. The termination of one or more of our contracts, or the occurrence of performance delays, cost overruns, product failures, materials or components shortages,  or  contract  definitization  delays,  could  negatively  impact  our  competitive  position,  results  of  operations,  financial condition and liquidity. U.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without  prior  notice,  at  the  U.S.  government's  convenience  or  for  default  based  on  performance.  If  one  of  our  contracts  is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for work accepted by the U.S. government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. In addition, we are a subcontractor on some contracts and the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, without regard to our performance as a subcontractor. We can give no assurance that we would be awarded new U.S. government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of the termination  of  any  of  our  contracts.  In  addition,  because  the  funding  of  U.S.  government  programs  is  subject  to  congressional appropriations made on a fiscal year basis even for multi-year programs, programs are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future years. Appropriation bills may be delayed, which may result in delays to funding, the collection of receivables and our contract performance due to lack of authorized funds to procure related products and services. Under certain circumstances, we may use our own funds to meet our customer's desired delivery dates or other requirements, but we may not be reimbursed. Further, if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable, reduced or delayed, the U.S. government may terminate for  convenience our contract or subcontract under that program. In addition, our U.S. government contracts typically involve  the  development,  application  and  manufacture  of  advanced  defense  and  technology  systems  and  products  aimed  at achieving  challenging  goals.  New  technologies  may  be  untested  or  unproven  and  in  some  instances,  product  requirements  or specifications may be modified. As a result, we may experience technological and other performance difficulties, which may result in delays, setbacks, cost overruns or product failures, and could divert our attention or resources from other projects. Our failure to execute effectively on our development programs could impact our future sales opportunities. Additionally, in order to win certain U.S. government contracts, we may be required to invest in development prior to award as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions. These additional investments may not be worthwhile if we are not chosen for these awards.\n\nOur U.S. government contracts are typically either fixed-priced contracts or cost reimbursement contracts. Fixed-price contracts are predominantly either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, we generally share with the U.S. government savings for cost underruns less than target costs and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated ceiling price. We carry the entire burden of cost overruns exceeding the ceiling price amount under FPI contracts. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed or performance-based fee, but  we  are  generally  not  reimbursed  for  unauthorized  costs  exceeding  a  cost  ceiling  amount  or  costs  not  allowable  under  the contract or applicable regulations. If we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, our profitability could be negatively affected, particularly under fixed-price development contracts. We may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenues, and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenues. While contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are  typically  cost  reimbursable,  they  can  be  FFP  or  FPI,  which  can  significantly  increase  our  risk  of  a  potential  negative  profit adjustment, as development contracts by nature involve elements that have not been undertaken before and, thus, are highly subject to  future  unexpected cost growth. In addition, other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production, which includes starting and stabilizing a manufacturing and test line while the final design is still being validated. Moreover, over the past several years, the DoD has increased its use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracts, under which it awards certain prototypes, research and production contracts without all of the procurement requirements that typically apply to DoD contracts, including justification of sole source awards. OTAs may use fixed-price contracts during all phases of the contract, or mandated contract  cost  sharing  (e.g.,  one-third  of  program  costs).  They  may  also  require  non-traditional  subcontractor  participation  and impose other requirements that differ from our other DoD contracts. Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to perform on our OTA contracts, including any applicable non-traditional requirements. Moreover, from time to time, we may begin performance under an undefinitized contract action with a not-to-exceed price prior to completing contract negotiations in order to support U.S. government priorities. Uncertainties in final contract price, specifications and terms, or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization, may negatively affect our profitability. In addition, as discussed more fully below, our U.S. government contracts also require us to comply with extensive and evolving procurement rules and regulations and subject us to potential U.S. government audits, investigations, and disputes. We are also involved in programs that are classified by the U.S.",

We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.\n\n## REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price when available. If standalone selling price is not available, we estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, which is generally based on an expected cost-plus-a-margin approach.\n\nWe  consider  the  contractual  consideration  payable  by  the  customer  and  assess  variable  consideration  that  may  affect  the  total  transaction  price,  including contractual  discounts,  contract  incentive  payments,  estimates  of  award  fees,  flight  hours,  aircraft  landings  or  other  customer  usage  activities  on  long-term maintenance contracts, and other sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract. We account for consideration payable to a customer as a reduction of revenue. Consideration payable to a customer may include cash amounts we are obligated to pay or expect to pay a customer, as well as credits or other items that can be applied against amounts owed to us. In our Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses, we may offer customer incentives to purchase our products, which may result in payments made to those customers.\n\nWhen reasonably able to estimate, we include variable consideration in the transaction price at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance, and our best judgment at the time. We also consider whether our contracts contain a significant financing component, which they generally do not.\n\nTiming of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across our businesses due to our diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied as of a point-in-time for certain aerospace components, engines, and spare parts. Revenue is recognized when control of the product transfers to the customer, generally upon product shipment. Since billing also typically occurs upon product shipment, we generally do not have Contract assets or Contract liabilities balances related to point-in-time sales.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced (continuous transfer of control), or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment for performance to date. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts.\n\nSubstantially all of our defense business revenue, which primarily relates to our Raytheon segment, and to a lesser extent Pratt &amp; Whitney and Collins, is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to our customers. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage-ofcompletion basis generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs can include labor, materials, subcontractors' costs, or other direct costs and indirect costs. Our contracts with the U.S. government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. Such advances are not considered a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance, and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis using costs incurred to date",

In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis.\n\nHolders of Class A common stock in the aggregate hold 66 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock. The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class B common stock having 15 votes per share. The Class B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\nRecord holders as of December 31, 2021 are presented in the table below.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, GD reported $354 million in equity funds under commingled funds within plan assets measured at fair value, with no mention of equity funds being included under NAV measurement. By 2023, GD reported a significant increase in commingled equity funds, totaling $4,429 million, and for the first time explicitly included $38 million in equity funds under the 'Plan assets measured using NAV as a practical expedient' category. This indicates a change in how certain equity fund investments were classified, with a portion now falling under NAV measurement, potentially reflecting a shift in investment structure or reporting methodology despite the substantial growth in the overall equity fund position.",

      "answer": "In 2022, UNP's Level 2 Investments were primarily short-term time deposits and government agency securities, valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value, with a total of $46 million as of December 31, 2021. In 2024, Bonds and Debentures, which include corporate and municipal debt securities, were also classified as Level 2 investments and valued using a bid evaluation process with data from independent pricing sources. Both years applied Level 2 valuation methods for fixed-income instruments, suggesting a consistent approach to fair value measurement for similar asset classes, though the specific asset composition and valuation techniques differed slightly between short-term deposits and longer-term bonds.",

Financial Instruments\n\nShort-Term Investments - All of the Company's short-term investments consist of time deposits and government agency securities. These investments are considered Level 2 investments and are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair  value. As  of  December  31,  2021,  the  Company  had  $46  million  of  short-term  investments. All short-term investments have a maturity of less than one year and are classified as held-to-maturity.\n\nFair  Value  of  Financial  Instruments -  The  fair  value  of  our  short-  and  long-term  debt  was  estimated  using  a market  value  price  model,  which  utilizes  applicable  U.S.  Treasury  rates  along  with  current  market  quotes  on comparable debt securities. All of the inputs used to determine the fair market value of the Corporation's long-term debt are Level 2 inputs and obtained from an independent source. At December 31, 2021, the fair value of total debt was $32.9 billion, approximately $3.2 billion more than the carrying value. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of total  debt  was  $31.9  billion,  approximately  $5.1  billion  more  than  the  carrying  value.  The  fair  value  of  the Corporation's debt is a measure of its current value under present market conditions. The fair value of our cash equivalents approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\n\n## 14.

      "answer": "In 2021, Caterpillar's EIP Plans purchased approximately 83,000 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter alone, indicating a targeted but relatively small-scale acquisition mechanism for non-U.S. employees. In contrast, the broader share repurchase program under the 2022 Authorization saw Caterpillar repurchase 19.5 million shares in 2023 at a cost of $4.7 billion, with $7.8 billion remaining available under that authorization. This reflects a significant increase in both the volume of shares acquired and the financial commitment from the company, moving from a specialized employee-focused plan to a large-scale corporate capital allocation strategy.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Emerson disclosed $1M related to AspenTech's operations, which coincided with AspenTech's active stock option plans that included expiration timelines within seven to ten years of grant. The company also accounted for post-combination service periods for converted AspenTech stock options, recognizing compensation expense over the remaining service periods. By 2024, the disclosed amount related to AspenTech increased to $8M, and Emerson noted that its own stock option plans had expired in 2021, with no new grants issued since. This suggests that AspenTech's ongoing option expiration policy continued to influence Emerson's financial statements through accounting for post-combination service periods, even as Emerson itself no longer issued stock options. The increase from $1M to $8M indicates a growing financial impact tied to AspenTech's stock-based compensation arrangements.",

      "answer": "In 2023, UPS Class A shares, which carry 10 votes per share, were primarily held by employees, retirees, and founder-related trusts, with 4.6 billion shares authorized. These shares are fully convertible into Class B shares, which have one vote per share and are publicly traded. By 2024, the same 4.6 billion Class A shares remained authorized, but the continued emphasis on convertibility suggests ongoing potential dilution of voting power as conversions occur. The fact that Class B shares remained at 5.6 billion authorized in both years indicates a stable public float despite possible conversions. This ownership structure evolution reflects a balance between maintaining insider control through Class A shares while preserving liquidity through the Class B public trading structure.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing applied a 24.2% default rate to CCC-rated receivables in its customer financing portfolio, indicating significant credit risk exposure. By 2023, the default rate assumption for CCC-rated receivables increased to 100%, signaling a complete loss expectation for this risk category. This change in default rate assumptions directly impacted the concentration risk in specific aircraft models that dominate the financing portfolio. In 2022, the portfolio was concentrated in certain aircraft models, and by 2023, Boeing continued to have significant exposure to those same models, but with heightened credit risk due to the more conservative default assumptions. This evolution suggests that Boeing's risk profile for aircraft models in its financing portfolio became more severe from 2022 to 2023, likely reflecting ongoing challenges in airline customer liquidity and market demand for specific aircraft types.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFurther  production  disruptions  and  inefficiencies,  suspension  of  operations  or  delayed  recovery  in  our  operations, and/or any comparable impacts involving one or more of our key suppliers, or the failure of any of our key suppliers, would result in further challenges to our business, which could have a further material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nLiquidity risks: The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a significant impact on our liquidity and overall debt levels. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used by operating activities was $3.4 billion. At December 31, 2021, cash and short-term investments totaled $16.2 billion. Our debt balance totaled $58.1 billion at December 31, 2021, down from $63.6 billion at December 31, 2020. We expect negative operating cash flows in future quarters until deliveries begin to return to historical levels, and if the pace and scope of the recovery are worse than we currently contemplate, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to fund our operations and obligations. If we were to need to obtain additional financing, uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its impact on us and the aerospace industry, as well as continued uncertainty with respect to our credit rating could limit our access to credit markets and we may have difficulty obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, certain of our customers may also be unable  to  make  timely  payments  to  us.  Factors  that  could  limit  our  access  to  additional  liquidity  include  further disruptions  in  the  global  capital  markets  and/or  additional  declines  in  our  financial  performance,  outlook  or  credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and/or meet outstanding debt obligations and contractual commitments. In addition, further downgrades in our credit ratings could  adversely  affect  our  cost  of  funds  and  related  margins,  liquidity,  competitive  position  and  access  to  capital markets, and a significant downgrade could have an adverse impact on our businesses.\n\nCustomer-related risks: Commercial air traffic has fallen dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend has impacted  passenger  traffic  most  severely.  Most  airlines  have  significantly  reduced  their  capacity,  and  many  could implement  further  reductions.  Many  airlines  are  also  implementing  significant  reductions  in  staffing.  These  capacity changes are causing, and are expected to continue to cause, negative impacts to our customers' revenue, earnings, and  cash  flow,  and  in  some  cases  may  threaten  the  future  viability  of  some  of  our  customers,  potentially  causing defaults within our customer financing portfolio, which was $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and/or requiring us to remarket aircraft  that  have  already  been  produced  and/or  are  currently  in  backlog.  If  we  are  unable  to  successfully remarket these aircraft and/or the narrow-body and wide-body markets do not recover as soon as we are currently assuming, or if we are required to further reduce production rates and/or contract the accounting quantity on any of our commercial programs, we could experience material reductions in earnings and/or be required to recognize a reachforward  loss  on  one  or  more  of  our  programs.  For  example,  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  we  recognized  a  reachforward  loss  on  the  777X  program  in  part  due  to  impacts  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic. Additionally,  we  may experience fewer new orders and increased cancellations across all of our commercial airplane programs as a result of the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  associated  impacts  on  demand.  Our  customers  may  also  lack  sufficient  liquidity  to purchase new aircraft due to impacts from the pandemic.\n\nIn addition to the near-term impact, there is risk that the industry implements longer-term strategies involving reduced capacity, shifting route patterns and mitigation strategies related to impacts from COVID-19 and the risk of future public health crises. In addition, airlines may experience reduced demand due to reluctance by the flying public to travel as a result of travel restrictions and/or social distancing requirements.\n\nAs a result, there is significant uncertainty with respect to whether and at what point commercial air traffic capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. This uncertainty may have a significant impact on the demand for both single-aisle  and  wide-body  commercial  aircraft,  as  well  as  for  the  services  we  provide  to  commercial  airlines.  In addition, a lengthy period of reduced industry-wide demand for commercial aircraft would put additional pressure on our suppliers,  resulting  in  increased  procurement  costs  and/or  additional  supply  chain  disruption.

      "question": "How did the sensitivity of UPS's pension obligations to discount rate changes evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this imply about the company's bond matching approach in managing long-term liabilities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UPS disclosed that as of December 31, 2021, each basis point change in the discount rate affected the projected benefit obligation by a specific amount (in millions), indicating the sensitivity of pension liabilities to interest rate assumptions. By 2024, the company reported the updated impact as of December 31, 2024, showing how this sensitivity had changed over time. Since UPS uses a bond matching approach to determine discount rates\u2014aligning bond cash flows with expected benefit payments\u2014the evolution in sensitivity reflects adjustments in the duration or structure of liabilities, changes in bond market conditions, or refinements in the settlement process. This implies that the bond matching approach was consistently applied but yielded different financial exposures due to temporal shifts in liability profiles or discount rate assumptions.",

This reduction in portfolio size (by about 2,800 annuities) may have slightly decreased overall exposure, but the increase in average attained age suggests that the remaining insured individuals were closer to life expectancy thresholds, potentially increasing the company's concentration of mortality risk. Since structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits, this demographic shift likely increased GE's financial exposure to mortality risk in 2023 compared to 2022.",

We reinsure approximately 27,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 54. These structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-thanaverage life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins). Unlike long- term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nOur life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. As of December 31, 2021, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance blocks, we reinsure approximately $70 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.7 million policies with an average attained age of 60. In 2021, our incurred claims were approximately $0.6 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $50,000. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20 and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20-year level term policies, which represent approximately 25% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2024 as the policies reach the end of their 20-year level premium period.\n\nInvestment portfolio and other adjustments. Our insurance liabilities and annuity benefits are primarily supported by investment securities of $41.6 billion and $42.0 billion and commercial mortgage loans of $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, we expect to purchase approximately $5.5 billion of new assets through 2024 in conjunction with expected capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2022, pending completion of our December 31, 2021 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. Our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and comprise mainly investment-grade debt securities. The portfolio includes $6.7 billion of net unrealized gains that are recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of applicable taxes and other adjustments as of December 31, 2021.\n\nIn calculating our future policy benefit reserves, we are required to consider the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investment securities supporting our insurance contracts as if those unrealized amounts were realized. To the extent that the realization of gains would result in a premium deficiency, an adjustment is recorded to increase future policy benefit reserves with an after-tax offset to Accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2021, $3.4 billion of net unrealized gains on our investment securities required a related increase to future policy benefit reserves. This adjustment decreased from $8.2 billion in 2020 to $3.4 billion in 2021 primarily from the higher margin resulting from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities. See Note 3 for further information about our investment securities.\n\nWe manage the investments in our run-off insurance operations under strict investment guidelines, including limitations on asset class concentration, single issuer exposures, asset-liability duration variances, and other factors to meet credit quality, yield, liquidity and diversification requirements associated with servicing our insurance liabilities under reasonable circumstances. This process includes consideration of various asset allocation strategies and incorporates information from several external investment advisors to improve our investment yield subject to maintaining our ability to satisfy insurance liabilities when due, as well as considering our risk-based capital requirements, regulatory constraints, and tolerance for surplus volatility. With the expected capital contributions through 2024, we intend to further diversify our portfolio, including with non-traditional asset classes such as private equity, senior secured loans and infrastructure debt, among others. Asset allocation planning is a dynamic process that considers changes in market conditions, risk appetite, liquidity needs and other factors which are reviewed on a periodic basis by our investment team. Investing in these assets exposes us to both credit risk (i.e., debtor's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest), interest rate risk (i.e., market price, cash flow variability, and reinvestment risk due to changes in market interest rates) and equity risk (i.e., the risk arising from",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe maintain unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plans for certain members of management and nonemployee directors. The amount of compensation deferred by each participant is based on participant elections. Participant accounts are credited with income primarily based on a fixed annual rate. Participants are eligible to receive distributions from their account based on elected deferral periods that are consistent with the plans and applicable tax law.\n\nWe have purchased life insurance policies to recover a portion of the future payments related to our deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the cash surrender value of these policies, which is recorded to other noncurrent assets, net, was $549 million and $481 million, respectively.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\nWe sponsor  several  401(k)  defined  contribution  retirement  plans  that  allow  eligible  employees  to  contribute  a  portion  of  their compensation through payroll deductions in accordance with specified plan guidelines. We make contributions to the plans that include matching a percentage of the employees' contributions up to certain limits. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, expenses related to these plans totaled $595 million, $599 million and $573 million, respectively.\n\nWe participate in various multiemployer benefit plans, including pension and postretirement benefit plans, that cover some of our employees and temporary employees who are represented by labor unions. We also participate in other multiemployer benefit plans that  provide health and welfare and retirement savings benefits to active and retired participants. If we cease to be obligated to make contributions or were to otherwise withdraw from participation in any of these plans, applicable law would require us to fund our allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits, which is known as a withdrawal liability. In addition, actions taken by other participating  employers  may  lead  to  adverse  changes  in  the  financial  condition  of  one  of  these  plans,  which  could  result  in  an increase  in  our  withdrawal  liability.  Total  contributions  we  made  to  multiemployer  benefit  plans  and  any  potential  withdrawal liabilities were not material in any of the periods presented.\n\n## Note 12: Equity\n\n## Common Stock\n\nIn the aggregate, holders of our Class A common stock have 66 /3% of the voting power of our common stock and holders of our Class B common stock have 33 /3% of the voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Each share of our Class B common stock is entitled to 15 votes. The number of votes held by each share of our Class A common stock depends on the number of shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding at any given time. The 33 /3% aggregate voting power of our Class B common stock cannot be diluted by additional issuances of any other class of common stock. Our Class B common stock is convertible, share for share, into Class A common stock, subject to certain restrictions. 2 1 1\n\n## Shares of Common Stock Outstanding\n\n",

      "question": "How did the reduction in FedEx's reliance on USPS air network contracts in 2022 influence the company's strategic shift toward differentiated service offerings in 2024, particularly in light of the Network 2.0 implementation and fdx platform launch?",
      "answer": "In 2022, FedEx identified that the USPS was strategically reducing its reliance on the FedEx Express air network, which had a negative impact on FedEx's results of operations. This prompted FedEx to re-evaluate its service offerings and customer dependencies. By 2024, the company responded by launching differentiated service offerings through initiatives like Network 2.0, which was implemented in over 50 U.S. locations and began transitioning Canadian operations, and the fdx platform introduced in January 2024. These innovations were part of a broader strategy to improve operational efficiency and reduce dependency on large customers like the USPS, while enhancing the value proposition of FedEx's services through digital integration and network optimization.",

In addition, we have a strong reputation among customers, team members, and the general public for high standards of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethics.

Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our team members or others with whom we do business, such as customer service mishaps, accidents, catastrophes, or incidents involving aircraft, vehicles, or facilities operated by us; low service or safety levels; data breaches or technology infrastructure disruptions; noncompliance with laws; the shipment of certain items pursuant to our obligation as a common carrier operating under federal law; our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, or marketing programs; or our executive compensation practices could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. With the increase in the use of social media outlets such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly without context, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. Further, our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation with certain groups, including our customers and team members. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and/or create difficulties in retaining and recruiting employee talent, and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.\n\nChanges in the business or financial soundness of the USPS, including strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air network of FedEx Express, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

See 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report under 'FedEx Express Segment' for more information.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the USPS. Additionally, the USPS continues to experience budgetary uncertainty as well as increased political debate regarding potential privatization or restructuring of its operations. The USPS is currently implementing strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air networks of FedEx Express and other transportation providers, which negatively impacted our results of operations in 2022. The difficulties discussed above or additional changes in the USPS's business, including its ability to access capital or any structural changes to its operations, network, volume levels, service offerings, service commitments, or pricing, could have additional negative impacts on our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, a decision by the USPS to terminate early or not renew its contract with FedEx Express for domestic services, which expires in September 2024, would negatively impact our profitability.\n\nWe face intense competition. The transportation and business services markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. Some of our competitors have more financial resources and competitive advantages than we do, appear willing to operate at little or no margin to gain market share, or they are owned, controlled, or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to raise capital more easily. We also compete with regional transportation providers that operate smaller and less capital-intensive transportation networks and startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, which could in turn reduce our revenues and market share. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. See 'Item 1.

Our business strategy also provides flexibility in structuring our network to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which the customer operates, allowing us to leverage and manage change. Volatility, uncertainty, and innovation have become the norms in the global transportation market, and we are able to use our flex ibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy.\n\nFor more than 50 years, we built networks that have created a differentiated and unmatched portfolio of services while continuously evolving to meet the changing needs of our customers and the market. With the recent significant growth of e-commerce and as our service mix continues to shift to deferred services, we are continuing to evolve to improve our operational efficiency and enhance profitability through one FedEx, Network 2.0 (our multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada), and DRIVE (our comprehensive program to improve long-term profitability). We are building a simplified experience to better serve our customers with enhanced capabilities and transforming to operate with more flexibility, efficiency, and intelligence.\n\nWe have implemented Network 2.0 in more than 50 locations in the U.S. and began the phased transition of all legacy FedEx Ground operations and personnel in Canada to Federal Express surface operations in April 2024. As we optimize our network under Network 2.0, Federal Express will continue to utilize both employee couriers and contracted service providers in U.S. surface operations using a market-by-market approach. Additionally, in 2024 we announced Tricolor, the redesign of the Federal Express international air network as part of the DRIVE program to improve efficiency and asset utilization. See 'Business Segments' below, 'Item 1A. Risk Factors,' and 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information on one FedEx, Network 2.0, and DRIVE. One FedEx and Network 2.0 will leverage the strength of our networks, people, and assets in more efficient ways, enabling a distinct focus on air and international volume while facilitating a more holistic approach to how we move packages on the ground.\n\nInnovation inspired our start at FedEx over 50 years ago, and it is fueling our future as we combine logistics with digital intelligence. Leveraging the capabilities of FedEx Dataworks, developments in data and technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, are facilitating the execution of our DRIVE transformation by creating new opportunities to improve our operational efficiency. See 'Business Segments' below for more information. The size and scale of our global network gives us key insights into global supply chains and trends. This foundation provides an immense amount of data we can use to build better insights, improve the customer experience, and differentiate our service offerings. To fully harness the power of this data, FedEx Dataworks is focused on putting our data into context and using it to enhance the efficiency of the FedEx network and the end-to-end experience of our customers by making supply chains smarter for everyone.\n\nIn January 2024, we announced fdx, a fully integrated data-driven commerce platform that connects the entire customer journey. See 'Federal Express Segment Customer-Driven Technology - E-Commerce and Digital Solutions' below for more information. In early 2025 we formed a new enterprise-wide Data &amp; Technology team, which is focused on initiatives to streamline the technology used during the package delivery lifecycle; establish global standards across pickup-and-delivery, linehaul, sort, and clearance operations; and improve digital products and experiences for the FedEx enterprise and our customers.\n\n'Safety Above All' is the first and foremost value in every aspect of our business. We are committed to making our workplaces and communities safer for our team members, customers, and the public. This philosophy is embedded in our day-to-day work through rigorous policies, continual education and engagement, and investments in technology designed to prevent accidents.\n\nThrough our global transportation, information technology, and retail networks, we help to facilitate an ongoing and unprecedented expansion of customer access to goods, services, and information. We believe it would be extremely difficult, costly, and time-consuming to replicate our global network, which reflects decades of investment, innovation, and expertise, includes the world's largest all-cargo air fleet, and connects more than 99% of the world's gross domestic product. We continue to position our company and team members to facilitate and capitalize on this access and to achieve stronger long-term growth, productivity, and profitability.\n\nDuring 2024 and early 2025, we introduced and expanded a number of innovative solutions, advanced important long-term business initiatives, and made other important investments that benefit our customers, team members, communities, and other stakeholders, including:\n\n-   Completing our one FedEx consolidation plan to bring FedEx Ground and FedEx Services into Federal Express, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground ex press network.\n-   Continuing DRIVE, our comprehensive program to improve our long-term profitability.\n-   Implementing Network 2.0 in more than 50 locations in the U.S. and beginning the phased implementation in Canada.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing faced significant financial risk from fixed-price development contracts, especially the KC-46A Tanker, where $402 million in additional losses were recorded in Q4 due to factory and supply chain disruptions, including the impact of the pandemic. By 2023, while the structure of risk remained, the nature of challenges evolved with ongoing supply chain and labor disruptions becoming central to cost estimation uncertainties. Auditors noted increased complexity in estimating final costs for the KC-46A Tanker and other programs, with these disruptions compounding the inherent financial risks of fixed-price development contracts. This indicates a transformation in the risk profile from pandemic-driven volatility to persistent operational constraints affecting cost predictability.",

The U.S. government contracting party  may  modify,  curtail  or  terminate  its  contracts  and  subcontracts  with  us,  without  prior  notice  and  either  at  its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such  as  'continuing  resolutions'  rather  than  full-year  appropriations.  Any  loss  or  anticipated  loss  or  reduction  of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable  under  U.S.  government  contracts. U.S.  government  agencies,  including  the  Defense  Contract  Audit Agency  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency,  routinely  audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.\n\n## We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.\n\nOur BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 68% and 69% of their 2021 revenues from fixed-price contracts.  While  fixed-price  contracts  enable  us  to  benefit  from  performance  improvements,  cost  reductions  and efficiencies,  they  also  subject  us  to  the  risk  of  reduced  margins  or  incurring  losses  if  we  are  unable  to  achieve estimated costs and revenues. In addition, increased compliance costs and costs due to loss of productivity due to COVID-19 may not be reimbursed. If  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  price,  we  recognize  reach-forward losses  which  can  significantly  affect  our  reported  results.  For  example  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  recorded additional losses of $402 million on the KC-46A Tanker contract reflecting continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the  process  of  estimating  costs  and  revenues  on  fixed-price  contracts  inherently  risky.  Fixed-price  contracts  often contain  price  incentives  and  penalties  tied  to  performance,  which  can  be  difficult  to  estimate  and  have  significant impacts  on  margins.  In  addition,  some  of  our  contracts  have  specific  provisions  relating  to  cost,  schedule  and performance.\n\nFixed-price  development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  Examples  of  significant  BDS  fixed-price  development  contracts include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military satellites.",

          "chunk_text": "## Cost Estimates for Fixed-Price Development Contracts - Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nAs more fully described in Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue over time for long-term contracts as goods are produced or services are rendered. The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin  at  completion.  The  process  of  estimating  margin  at  completion  involves  estimating  the  costs  to  complete production of goods or rendering of services and comparing those costs to the estimated final revenue amount. Fixedprice development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant variability. Due to the technical performance requirements in many of these  contracts,  changes  to  cost  and  revenue  estimates  could  occur,  resulting  in  lower  margins  or  material  reachforward losses.\n\nGiven  the  complexity  of  certain  of  the  Company's  fixed-price  development  contracts,  including  the  KC-46A  Tanker, Commercial Crew, and United States Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft contracts, the limited amount of historical data available in certain instances and significant judgments necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the cost estimates for the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, and United States Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft fixed-price development contracts included the following, among others:\n\n- We  evaluated  the  appropriateness  and  consistency  of  management's  methods  used  in  developing  its estimates.\n- We  evaluated  the  reasonableness  of  judgments  made  and  significant  assumptions  used  by  management relating to key cost and schedule estimates, including the range and probability of reasonable outcomes, and the appropriateness of the timing of changes to key estimates.\n- We performed inquiries of the Company's project managers and others directly involved with the contracts to evaluate  management's ability  to  achieve  the  key  cost  and  schedule  estimates,  as  well  as  evaluate  project status and project challenges which may affect total estimated costs to complete. We also observed the project work site when key estimates related to tangible or physical progress of the project.\n- We  tested  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  key  data  used  in  developing  estimates.  We  developed independent  expectations  of  reasonable  outcomes  using,  in  part,  the  program's  data  and  compared  our expectations to management's estimates.\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over the review of judgments made and significant assumptions used to develop  key  estimates,  including  controls  over  the  key  data  used  in  developing  the  estimates  and  the mathematical extrapolation of such data.\n- We performed retrospective reviews, comparing actual performance to estimated performance and the related financial  statement  impact,  including  the  appropriateness  of  the  timing  of  changes  to  key  estimates,  when evaluating the thoroughness and precision of management's estimation process and effectiveness of related internal controls.",

ASU 2022-06 deferred the sunset date of ASU 2020-04 to December 31, 2024, allowing FedEx more time to apply the optional expedients and exceptions for contracts, hedging relationships, and transactions affected by reference rate reform. By fiscal 2024, FedEx continued to monitor its contracts and transactions for potential application of these ASUs, with no material effect on financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows as of May 31, 2024.

          "chunk_text": "## FEDEX CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNew Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), and in December 2022 subsequently issued ASU 2022-06 to temporarily ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The standards provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to existing contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The standards apply only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') or another reference rate to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The standards were effective upon issuance and can generally be applied through December 31, 2024. While there has been no material effect to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows from reference rate reform as of May 31, 2024, we continue to monitor our contracts and transactions for potential application of these ASUs.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which expands disclosures about a public entity's reportable segments and requires more enhanced information about a reportable segment's expenses, interim segment profit or loss, and how a public entity's chief operating decision maker uses reported segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and allocating resources. The update will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 (fiscal 2025). We are assessing the effect of this update on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands disclosures in an entity's income tax rate reconciliation table and regarding cash taxes paid both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The update will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 (fiscal 2026). We are assessing the effect of this update on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nIn March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') adopted final rules requiring public entities to provide certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. As part of the disclosures, entities will be required to quantify certain effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions in a note to their audited financial statements. The rules will be effective for annual periods beginning in calendar 2025 (fiscal 2026). In April 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed implementation of the final rules pending certain legal challenges. We are assessing the effect of the new rules on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 3: CREDIT LOSSES\n\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our trade receivables. We assess ability to pay for certain customers by conducting a credit review, which considers the customer's established credit rating and our assessment of creditworthiness. We determine the allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable using a combination of specific reserves for accounts that are deemed to exhibit credit loss indicators and general reserves that are determined using loss rates based on historical write-offs by geography and recent forecast information, including underlying economic expectations. We update our estimate of credit loss reserves quarterly, considering recent write-offs, collections information, and underlying economic expectations.\n\nCredit losses were $421 million in 2024, $696 million in 2023, and $403 million in 2022. Our allowance for credit losses was $436 million at May 31, 2024 and $472 million at May 31, 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2023, MMM disclosed facing PFAS-related liabilities, including those tied to the proposed class-action settlement with public water systems and uncertainties around opt-outs and appeals. Following the April 2024 spin-off, the separation agreement allocated future PFAS liabilities arising from Solventum\u2019s operations post-April 1, 2024, to Solventum, while MMM retained legacy liabilities. This led to MMM\u2019s 2024 disclosures reflecting a reduced contingent liability exposure for PFAS-related litigation, as Solventum assumed responsibility for new liabilities, although MMM still maintained accruals for legacy claims and certain product liabilities sold by Solventum before 2026. The change in liability structure is evident in MMM\u2019s 2024 10-K, where the focus shifted from broad PFAS exposure to more defined legacy risk retention.",

The Company will retain all PFASrelated liabilities resulting from the business, operations, and activities of (x ) the Company's business (as defined in the separation and distribution agreement) and (y) Solventum's business (as defined in the separation and distribution agreement) prior to April 1, 2024. Solventum will retain liability for all PFAS-related liabilities resulting from the business, operations, and activities of its business at or after April 1, 2024, other than liabilities from product claims alleging harm from the presence of PFAS in certain products of Solventum's business sold at or after April 1, 2024, and prior to January 1, 2026 (subject to ex ceptions described in further detail below). The Company will retain liabilities related to site-based PFAS contamination at any real property owned, leased or operated by the Company and liabilities for site-based PFAS contamination arising from third-party claims at sites allocated to the Solventum group in the separation to the extent such liabilities relate to PFAS contamination existing at or prior to April 1, 2024. Solventum assumes PFAS liabilities from the Solventum sites to the extent resulting from an action taken by any member of the Solventum group following April 1, 2024, or from any failure by Solventum following April 1, 2024, to use commercially reasonable efforts that are consistent with then-current industry standards to avoid contamination. The Company will also retain PFAS liabilities for product claims (x) arising from the Company's products, (y) arising from Solventum's products sold prior to April 1, 2024, and (z) arising from certain products sold by Solventum at or after April 1, 2024, and prior to January 1, 2026 (subject to the ex ceptions described below). Clause (z) in the immediately preceding sentence will not ex tend to PFAS liabilities for product claims resulting from (i) new products introduced by Solventum following April 1, 2024, that contain or are enabled by PFAS that is not supplied by the Company, (ii) products that are modified by Solventum after April 1, 2024, to add, contain or become enabled by PFAS that is not supplied by the Company, or with respect to which any modification made after April 1, 2024, in the formulation or production of the product that changes the amount or type of PFAS contained in the product or the amount or type of PFAS enabling the product, in each case from and after the date of such modification, (iii) PFAS that is added to a Solventum product after it is sold by Solventum and (iv) PFAS that has accumulated in or on a Solventum product as a result of the use of the product (whether or not the product is being used as directed), including through filtration, purification or similar application. Solventum will be responsible for the maintenance of certain PFAS containment measures at its properties after the effective time of the distribution. In addition, and consistent with the allocation described above, the Company will retain specifically identified PFAS-related liabilities, including those resulting from specified PFAS-related litigation matters and liabilities under the Company's settlement agreement with public water systems in the United States, as described below.\n\nThe following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated insurance recoveries the Company has recorded relating to its significant legal proceedings.\n\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation: As of December 31, 2024, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately 3,500 individual claimants, compared to approximately 4,042 individual claimants with actions pending December 31, 2023.\n\nThe vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company's mask and respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.\n\nThe Company's current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, is expected to represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. Over the past twenty plus years, the Company has prevailed in nineteen of the twenty cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits described below) and, in the last twelve months, 3M has successfully defended two respirator product liability trials. In February 2024, a jury in Kentucky delivered a defense verdict in favor of 3M, concluding that 3M's 8710 and 8210 respirators that the plaintiff claimed to have used were not defective. In April 2024, another jury in Kentucky returned a defense verdict in 3M's favor and concluded that 3M's 8710 respirator that the plaintiff claimed to have used was not defective.\n\nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company's respiratory protection products. Nonetheless, the Company's litigation experience indicates that claims of persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to litigate and resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it ex perienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWhen making determinations about recording liabilities related to legal proceedings, the Company complies with the requirements of ASC 450, Contingencies, and related guidance, and records liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the loss is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records as an accrual in its financial statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. Based on ex perience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether a loss previously determined to not be reasonably estimable and/or not probable is now able to be reasonably estimated or has become probable. Where appropriate, the Company makes additions to or adjustments of its reasonably estimated losses and/or accruals. As a result, the current accruals and/or estimates of loss and the estimates of the potential impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings, and claims pending against the Company will likely change over time.\n\nBecause litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, the Company may ultimately incur charges substantially in ex cess of presently recorded liabilities, including with respect to matters for which no accruals are currently recorded, because losses are not currently probable and reasonably estimable. Many of the matters described herein are at varying stages, seek an indeterminate amount of damages, or seek damages in amounts that the Company believes are not indicative of the ultimate losses that may be incurred. It is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years. As a matter progresses, the Company may receive information, through plaintiff demands, through discovery, in the form of reports of purported experts, or in the context of settlement or mediation discussions, that purport to quantify an amount of alleged damages, but with which the Company may not agree. Such information may or may not lead the Company to determine that it is able to make a reasonable estimate as to a probable loss or range of loss in connection with a matter. However, even when a loss or range of loss is not probable and reasonably estimable, developments in, or the ultimate resolution of, a matter could be material to the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, future adverse rulings or developments, or settlements in, one or more matters could result in future changes to determinations of probable and reasonably estimable losses in other matters.\n\nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings: The Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of the terms of its numerous policies, including their ex clusions, pertinent case law interpreting comparable policies, its ex perience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and records an amount it has concluded is recognizable and expects to receive in light of the loss recovery and/or gain contingency models under ASC 450, ASC 610-30, and related guidance. For those insured legal proceedings where the Company has recorded an accrued liability in its financial statements, the Company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable from the Company's insurance program. For those insured matters where the Company has not recorded an accrued liability because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, but where the Company has incurred an ex pense in defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable for the expense incurred.\n\nImpact of Solventum Spin-Off : On April 1, 2024, the Company completed the planned spin-off of its Health Care business as an independent company known as Solventum. Concurrent with the spin-off, the Company and Solventum entered into various agreements, including transition agreements and a separation and distribution agreement that, among other things, identified the assets to be transferred, the liabilities to be assumed, indemnification and defense obligations, and the contracts to be transferred to Solventum and 3M as part of the spin-off. In general, and except as noted below and as set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, certain liabilities related to Solventum or the assets that are transferred to Solventum in connection with the spin-off will be retained by or transferred to Solventum. For example, potential liabilities associated with the matters previously described in prior filings under the Bair Hugger and Federal False Claims Act / Qui Tam Litigation sections of this Note 19 have been assumed by Solventum pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, and Solventum will indemnify and defend the Company in these actions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GE's premium deficiency testing for long-term care insurance relied heavily on morbidity assumptions, including claim incidence, utilization, and continuance, based on historical data from ceding entities, and had eliminated issue age adjustments to morbidity starting in 2017. By 2024, GE continued to depend on ceding entities for policy and claim data but expanded its monitoring to include mortality trends in life insurance contracts, particularly for policies with net amounts at risk totaling $45 billion. The evolution of assumptions and data validation processes shows that GE's reliance on ceding entities remained critical, but the scope of data used broadened to include more mortality-focused experience studies, especially as structured settlement annuities and life insurance policies extended decades into the future.",

Significant uncertainties exist in testing cash flow projections in the premium deficiency test for these insurance contracts, including consideration of a wide range of possible outcomes of future events over the life of the insurance contracts that can extend for long periods of time.\n\nGiven the significant judgments made by management in estimating the cash flow projections used in the premium deficiency test, including the determination of certain key assumptions, auditing the premium deficiency test required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our actuarial specialists. Key assumptions impacting the cash flow projections that are sensitive and are more subjective requiring significant judgment by management are discount rate, rate of changes in morbidity, and future long-term care premium rate increases.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures, which included the involvement of our actuarial specialists, related to the premium deficiency analysis included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the premium deficiency test process, including controls over the development of key assumptions and management's judgments related to the development of the cash flow projections.\n- We tested the underlying data for completeness and accuracy, including historical cash flows and experience study data, that served as the basis for the actuarial estimates.\n- We evaluated the key assumptions by considering historical actual experience, sensitivity analyses, relevant industry data when available, and management's basis for changes or lack of change in key assumptions.\n- We performed recalculations to assess that the key assumptions were reflected in the cash flow projections.\n- We evaluated the impact of updated key assumptions to the projected cash flows and the overall conclusion for the premium deficiency test.\n\n## /s/ DELOITTE &amp; TOUCHE LLP\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nFebruary 11, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2020.\n\n## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of General Electric Company\n\n## Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of General Electric Company and subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated February 11, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

          "chunk_text": "Our run-off insurance operations have approximately $0.8 billion of assets held by states or other regulatory bodies in statutorily required deposit accounts, and approximately $31.0 billion of assets held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts and reinsurance security trust agreements in place between either ERAC or UFLIC as the reinsuring entity and a number of ceding insurers. Assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contracts and trust agreements. Some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of ERAC or UFLIC which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates and benefit utilization rates); morbidity improvement (i.e., assumed rate of improvement in morbidity in the future); mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force); anticipated premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, including actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2030, on long-term care insurance policies; and interest rates. Assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.\n\nClaim reserves . Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. Key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. Claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.\n\nReinsurance recoverables . We cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies, and record receivables for estimated recoveries as we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholders or cedents. These receivables are estimated in a manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves. Reserves ceded to reinsurers, net of allowance, were $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in the caption All other assets in our Statement of Financial Position.\n\nPremium Deficiency Testing . We annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. The premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. A comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. Premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nThe primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include:\n\nMorbidity . Morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. For long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last). Prior to 2017, premium deficiency assumptions considered the risk of anti-selection by including issue age adjustments to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long-term care policies issued to younger individuals would exhibit lower expected incidences and claim costs than those issued to older policyholders. Recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curves indicated issue age differences had minimal impact on claim cost projections, and, accordingly, beginning in 2017, issue age adjustments were eliminated in developing morbidity assumptions. Higher morbidity increases, while lower morbidity decreases, the present value of expected future benefit payments.",

A pproximately 27% of these structured settlement annuities were underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than-average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment). Unlike long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nLife Insurance contracts. Our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. A t December 31, 2024, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance portfolio, we reinsure approximately $45 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.1 million policies with an average attained age of 63. In 2024, our incurred claims were approximately $0.4 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $46,100. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20- and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20- and 30-year level term policies, which represent approximately 7% and 43% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2026 and 2035 as the policies reach the end of their 20- and 30-year level premium period, respectively.\n\nCritical Accounting E stimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums and are estimated based on actuarial assumptions such as mortality, morbidity, terminations, and expenses. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings. Our annual review procedures include updating certain experience studies since our last completed review, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. The review of experience and assumptions is a comprehensive and complex process that depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. The review relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance portfolio includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.",

      "question": "How did Caterpillar's application of ASU 2022-06 on reference rate reform in 2023 reflect changes in their hedging relationship accounting policies compared to 2022, particularly regarding the extension of optional relief for LIBOR replacements?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar disclosed detailed hedging relationship accounting policies, including the designation of derivatives as fair value or cash flow hedges, with specific documentation and effectiveness testing requirements. They used foreign currency forwards and options to manage exchange rate risks and interest rate contracts to manage interest rate exposure. In 2023, Caterpillar applied ASU 2022-06, which extended the sunset date for reference rate reform optional expedients and exceptions to December 31, 2024. This allowed Caterpillar to continue using relief provisions for contract modifications replacing reference rates affected by reform (e.g., LIBOR) in hedging relationships entered into or evaluated before the new deadline. The adoption of ASU 2022-06 reduced operational complexity and financial impact of replacing reference rates in contracts modified between March 12, 2020, and December 31, 2024, without materially affecting consolidated financial statements. This reflects a policy evolution where Caterpillar benefits from extended regulatory flexibility in managing reference rate transitions within their hedging framework.",

On the date the derivative contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flow (cash flow hedge) or (3) an undesignated instrument. We record in current earnings changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged recognized asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk. We record in AOCI changes in the fair  value  of  a  derivative  that  is  qualified,  designated  and  highly  effective  as  a  cash  flow  hedge,  to  the  extent  effective,  in Statement 3 until we reclassify them to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  We report changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments in current earnings. We classify cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments within the same category as the item being hedged on Statement 5.  We include cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments in the investing category on Statement 5.\n\nWe  formally  document  all  relationships  between  hedging  instruments  and  hedged  items,  as  well  as  the  risk-management objective  and  strategy  for  undertaking  various  hedge  transactions.    This  process  includes  linking  all  derivatives  that  are designated  as  fair  value  hedges  to  specific  assets  and  liabilities  in  Statement  3  and  linking  cash  flow  hedges  to  specific forecasted transactions or variability of cash flow.\n\nWe also formally assess, both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the designated derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flow of hedged items.  When a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting.\n\n## A. Foreign currency exchange rate risk\n\nForeign currency exchange rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the U.S. dollar value of sales made and costs incurred in foreign currencies. Movements in foreign currency rates also affect our competitive position as these changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S.-based competitors. Additionally, we have balance sheet positions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby creating exposure to movements in exchange rates.\n\nOur ME&amp;T operations purchase, manufacture and sell products in many locations around the world. As we have a diversified revenue and cost base, we manage our future foreign currency cash flow exposure on a net basis. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for  managing  anticipated  foreign  currency  cash  flow  for  up  to  approximately  five  years.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  the maximum term of these outstanding contracts at inception was approximately 60 months.\n\nWe generally designate as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract any Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian  dollar,  Chinese  yuan,  Euro,  Indian  rupee,  Japanese  yen,  Mexican  peso,  Norwegian  Krona,  Singapore  dollar  or Thailand baht forward or option contracts that meet the requirements for hedge accounting and the maturity extends beyond the current quarter-end. We perform designation on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. The remainder of ME&amp;T foreign currency contracts are undesignated.\n\nIn  managing  foreign  currency  risk  for  our  Financial  Products  operations,  our  objective  is  to  minimize  earnings  volatility resulting  from  conversion  and  the  remeasurement  of  net  foreign  currency  balance  sheet  positions  and  future  transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to  offset  the  risk  of  currency  mismatch  between  our  assets  and  liabilities  and  exchange  rate  risk  associated  with  future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency forward and option contracts are primarily undesignated. We designate fixed-to-fixed cross currency contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against movements in exchange rates on foreign currency fixed-rate assets and liabilities.\n\n## B. Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed-rate debt. Our practice is to use interest rate contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate changes.",

AspenTech, as defined in Note 4, operates as a separate publicly traded company and has v arious stock-based compensation plans, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units, which are settled in their own common stock and are accounted for as equity awards. Restricted stock units and performance stock units generally v est ov er three years. In fiscal 2023 and 2024, the Company granted performance stock units with both a performance and serv ice condition. The performance condition relates to the attainment of predefined goals based on annual contract v alue and free cash flows. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the probability that the threshold performance goals will be achiev ed, if at all, and the anticipated lev el of attainment to determine the amount of compensation expense to record in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Option awards hav e been granted with an exercise price equal to the market closing price of AspenTech's stock on the trading day prior to the grant date. These options generally v est ov er four years and expire within sev en years or ten years of grant. AspenTech's policy is to issue new shares upon the exercise of v ested stock awards.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement between Emerson and Heritage AspenTech, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock, whether vested or unvested, that was unexercised as of immediately prior to the closing date was conv erted into an option to acquire shares of AspenTech. Each conv erted option is subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original option. In addition, each outstanding award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock that were unv ested as of immediately prior to the closing date was conv erted into an award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of AspenTech. Each conv erted restricted stock unit is also subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original restricted stock unit.\n\nASC 805 required the Company to determine the fair v alue of the AspenTech share-based payment awards related to the replacement of the Heritage AspenTech share-based payment awards, and allocate the total fair v alue based on the serv ices that are attributable to the pre- and post-combination serv ice periods, respectiv ely. The portion that is attributable to the pre-combination serv ice period was considered part of the consideration transferred for Heritage AspenTech and included as part of the purchase price. The portion that is attributable to the post-combination serv ice period is recognized as stock-based compensation expense in the post-combination consolidated financial statements ov er the remaining requisite serv ice period.\n\n## AspenTech Stock Options\n\nAspenTech utilizes the Black-Scholes option v aluation model for estimating the fair v alue of options granted. The Black-Scholes option v aluation model incorporates assumptions regarding expected stock price v olatility, the expected life of the option, the risk-free interest rate, div idend yield and the market value of AspenTech's common stock. The expected stock price v olatility is determined based on AspenTech's stock's historic prices ov er a period commensurate with the expected life of the award. The expected life of an option represents the period for which options are expected to be outstanding as determined by historic option exercises and cancellations. The risk-free",

Gross profit was $8,885 in 2024 compared to $7,427 in 2023, while gross margin increased 1.8 percentage points to 50.8 percent, reflecting the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition and higher price partially offset by the impact from acquisition-related inv entory step-up amortization of $231, which negativ ely impacted margins by approximately 1.3 percentage points.\n\nCost of sales for 2023 were $7,738, an increase of $240 compared with $7,498 in 2022. Gross profit was $7,427 in 2023 compared to $6,306 in 2022, while gross margin increased 3.3 percentage points to 49.0 percent due to fav orable price less net material inflation, the impact of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition which benefited margins by 0.6 percentage points, and fav orable mix.\n\n## SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $5,142 in 2024 increased $956 compared with 2023 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.8 percentage points to 29.4 percent, reflecting the impact of the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition, partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $4,186 in 2023 increased $572 compared with 2022 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.4 percentage points to 27.6 percent, reflecting the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and higher stock compensation expense of $125, of which $75 related to Emerson stock plans due to a higher share price and $50 was attributable to AspenTech stock plans. These items were partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\n## SALE OF COPELAND NOTE RECEIVABLE AND EQUITY INTEREST\n\nOn June 6, 2024, the Company entered into definitiv e agreements to sell its 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to priv ate equity funds managed by Blackstone for $1.5 billion and its note receiv able to Copeland for $1.9 billion, and the transactions were subsequently completed in August 2024. Upon entering into the note agreement, the Company recorded a pretax loss in continuing operations of $279 ($217 after-tax, $0.38 per share) to adjust the carrying v alue of the note to $1.9 billion to reflect the transaction price, while the Company recognized a gain of $539 ($435 after-tax) in discontinued operations upon the sale of the common equity interest. In addition, the equity method losses related to the Company's non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland, which were reported since May 2023 in Other deductions, net, hav e been reclassified and are now reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\n\n## GAIN ON SUBORDINATED INTEREST\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company receiv ed a distribution of $438 related to its subordinated interest in Vertiv  (in total, a pretax gain of $453 was recognized in the first quarter of 2022, $358 after-tax, $0.60 per share) and receiv ed the remaining $15 related to the pretax gain in the first quarter of 2023. In 2023, the Company receiv ed additional distributions totaling $161 ($122 after-tax, $0.21 per share) and in 2024, receiv ed its final distribution of $79 ($60 after-tax, $0.10 per share).\n\n## OTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET\n\nOther deductions, net were $1,434 in 2024, an increase of $928 compared with 2023. The current year included intangibles amortization related to the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition of $560, while restructuring costs increased by $156 and acquisition/div estiture costs increased by $27. The Company also incurred div estiture losses of $48 ($50 after-tax, $0.09 per share).\n\nOther deductions, net were $506 in 2023, a decrease of $13 compared with 2022, and included higher intangibles amortization of $146 primarily related to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and an unfav orable impact from foreign currency transactions of $112 reflecting losses in the current year compared to gains in the prior year.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nTrade receivables are primarily short-term receivables from independently owned and operated dealers and customers which arise in the normal course of business. We perform regular credit evaluations of our dealers and customers. Collateral generally is not required, and the majority of our trade receivables are unsecured. We do, however, when deemed necessary, make use of various  devices  such  as  security  agreements  and  letters  of  credit  to  protect  our  interests.  No  single  dealer  or  customer represents a significant concentration of credit risk.\n\nFinance  receivables  and  wholesale  inventory  receivables  primarily  represent  receivables  under  installment  sales  contracts, receivables arising from leasing transactions and notes receivable. We typically maintain a security interest in retail financed equipment  and,  in  some  instances,  wholesale  financed  equipment.  We  also  typically  require  physical  damage  insurance coverage on financed equipment. No single customer or dealer represented a significant concentration of credit risk.\n\nShort-term and long-term investments are held with high quality institutions and, by policy, the amount of credit exposure to any  one  institution  is  limited.  Long-term  investments,  primarily  included  in  Other  assets  in  Statement  3,  are  comprised primarily of available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities at Insurance Services.\n\nFor derivative contracts, collateral is generally not required of the counterparties or of our company.  The company generally enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements within ME&amp;T and Financial Products that permit the net settlement of amounts owed under their respective derivative contracts.  Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties is limited to only those gains that we have recorded, but for which we have not yet received cash payment. The master netting agreements reduce the amount of loss the company would incur should the counterparties fail to meet their obligations.  At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the maximum exposure to credit loss was $342 million and $281 million, respectively, before the application of any master netting agreements.\n\nPlease refer to Note 18 above for fair value information.\n\n## 20. Leases\n\n## A. Lessee arrangements\n\nWe lease certain property, information technology equipment, warehouse equipment, vehicles and other equipment through operating  leases.  We  recognize  a  lease  liability  and  corresponding  right-of-use  asset  based  on  the  present  value  of  lease payments. To determine the present value of lease payments for most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on information available on the lease commencement date. For certain property and information technology equipment leases, we have elected to separate payments for lease components from non-lease components. For all other leases, we have elected not to separate payments for lease and non-lease components. Our lease agreements may include options to extend or terminate  the  lease.  When  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  we  will  exercise  that  option,  we  have  included  the  option  in  the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. We have elected not to recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less.\n\nOur finance leases are not significant and therefore are not included in the following disclosures.\n\nThe components of lease costs were as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did UNP's allocation to limited partnerships in 2023 influence its real estate fund valuation methodology in 2024, particularly in terms of unfunded commitments and NAV-based reporting?",
      "answer": "In 2023, UNP disclosed that its pension plan had approximately $3.3 billion in unfunded commitments to limited partnerships, including real estate funds, which were valued using NAV due to the lack of readily observable market data. These limited partnerships were primarily invested in private companies and real estate, with valuations derived from property appraisals and partnership financial reports. In 2024, UNP continued to rely on NAV-based valuation for real estate funds, indicating a consistent methodology dependent on private appraisals and partnership structures. The persistence of NAV-based reporting and the presence of unfunded commitments in 2023 suggest that UNP\u2019s reliance on limited partnerships in 2023 directly shaped its continued valuation practices for real estate funds in 2024.",

T hese  assets  are  v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by independent pricing sources.

Most common shares are traded activ ely on exchanges and price quotes for these shares are readily av ailable. Common stock is classified as a Lev el 1 inv estment. Preferred shares included in this category are v alued using a bid ev aluation process with bid data prov ided by independent pricing sources. Preferred stock is classified as a Lev el 2 inv estment.\n\nVenture Capital and Buyout Partnerships - This inv estment category is comprised of interests in limited partnerships that inv est primarily in priv atelyheld companies. Due to the priv ate nature of the partnership inv estments, pricing inputs are not readily observ able. Asset v aluations are dev eloped by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These v aluations are based on the application of public market multiples to priv ate company cash flows, market transactions that prov ide v aluation information for comparable companies, and other methods. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using each partnership's net asset v alue (NAV).\n\nReal Estate Funds -  T he  plan's  real  estate  inv estments  are  primarily  interests  in  priv ate  real  estate  inv estment  trusts,  partnerships,  limited  liability companies, and similar structures. Valuations for the holdings in this category are not based on readily observ able inputs and are primarily deriv ed from property appraisals. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using the NAV for each inv estment.\n\nCollective  Trust  and  Other  Funds -  Collectiv e  trust  and  other  funds  are  comprised  of  shares  or  units  in  commingled  funds  and  limited  liability companies that are not publicly traded.

By 2024, the company still authorized 4.6 billion Class A shares and 5.6 billion Class B shares, indicating no change in the quantity of shares authorized for either class. However, the continued existence of the same voting rights structure (10 votes for Class A and 1 vote for Class B) and the convertibility of Class A to Class B shares suggests a consistent governance framework. This reflects a stable relationship between the share classes despite the transition from 2023 to 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GE reinsured approximately 27,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 54, while in 2023, this number decreased to 24,600 contracts with an average attained age of 56. This indicates a reduction in the number of contracts by 2,800 and an increase in the average attained age by 2 years. The shift suggests that GE's mortality risk exposure evolved as the portfolio aged and shrank, which could increase the duration of payments due to longer-than-expected life spans. This change in the structured settlement annuities portfolio reflects how mortality risk negatively impacts the company's obligations under these contracts, as outlined in the filings.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(a)    Statutory balances reflect recognition of the estimated remaining statutory increase in reserves of approximately $3.6 billion through 2023 under the permitted accounting practice discussed further below and in Note 11 .\n\nStructured settlement annuities and life insurance contracts. We reinsure approximately 27,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 54. These structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-thanaverage life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins). Unlike long- term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nOur life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. As of December 31, 2021, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance blocks, we reinsure approximately $70 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.7 million policies with an average attained age of 60. In 2021, our incurred claims were approximately $0.6 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $50,000. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20 and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20-year level term policies, which represent approximately 25% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2024 as the policies reach the end of their 20-year level premium period.\n\nInvestment portfolio and other adjustments. Our insurance liabilities and annuity benefits are primarily supported by investment securities of $41.6 billion and $42.0 billion and commercial mortgage loans of $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, we expect to purchase approximately $5.5 billion of new assets through 2024 in conjunction with expected capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2022, pending completion of our December 31, 2021 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. Our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and comprise mainly investment-grade debt securities. The portfolio includes $6.7 billion of net unrealized gains that are recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of applicable taxes and other adjustments as of December 31, 2021.\n\nIn calculating our future policy benefit reserves, we are required to consider the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investment securities supporting our insurance contracts as if those unrealized amounts were realized. To the extent that the realization of gains would result in a premium deficiency, an adjustment is recorded to increase future policy benefit reserves with an after-tax offset to Accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2021, $3.4 billion of net unrealized gains on our investment securities required a related increase to future policy benefit reserves. This adjustment decreased from $8.2 billion in 2020 to $3.4 billion in 2021 primarily from the higher margin resulting from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities. See Note 3 for further information about our investment securities.\n\nWe manage the investments in our run-off insurance operations under strict investment guidelines, including limitations on asset class concentration, single issuer exposures, asset-liability duration variances, and other factors to meet credit quality, yield, liquidity and diversification requirements associated with servicing our insurance liabilities under reasonable circumstances. This process includes consideration of various asset allocation strategies and incorporates information from several external investment advisors to improve our investment yield subject to maintaining our ability to satisfy insurance liabilities when due, as well as considering our risk-based capital requirements, regulatory constraints, and tolerance for surplus volatility. With the expected capital contributions through 2024, we intend to further diversify our portfolio, including with non-traditional asset classes such as private equity, senior secured loans and infrastructure debt, among others. Asset allocation planning is a dynamic process that considers changes in market conditions, risk appetite, liquidity needs and other factors which are reviewed on a periodic basis by our investment team. Investing in these assets exposes us to both credit risk (i.e., debtor's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest), interest rate risk (i.e., market price, cash flow variability, and reinvestment risk due to changes in market interest rates) and equity risk (i.e., the risk arising from",

IAE and IAE LLC retain limited equity with the primary economics of the programs passed to the participants. As such, we have determined that IAE and IAE LLC are variable interest  entities  with  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney  as  the  primary  beneficiary.  IAE  and  IAE  LLC  have,  therefore,  been  consolidated.  The carrying amounts and classification of assets and liabilities for variable interest entities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the solvency concerns surrounding Genworth in 2022 influence UFLIC's trust asset controls in 2023, and what impact did this have on GE's financial services risk exposure across the two years?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GE's financial services risk exposure was heightened due to solvency concerns about Genworth and its subsidiaries, which held control over trust assets benefiting UFLIC. These concerns were amplified by Genworth's public statement in 2021 that proceeds from its contingency plan would be used to repay parent company debt rather than bolster its insurance subsidiaries' capital. By 2023, these solvency concerns had evolved into potential regulatory actions that could adversely affect UFLIC, including possible control over assets in the relevant trusts. This evolution increased GE's contingent liabilities and loss estimates, particularly in its run-off insurance operations, materially and adversely affecting GE's financial position and liquidity outlook. The shift from potential risk in 2022 to realized exposure in 2023 demonstrates a clear temporal chain where Genworth's instability directly impacted UFLIC's asset control mechanisms, which in turn negatively affected GE's financial services risk profile.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GE(2022) \u2192 Genworth: GE's 2022 disclosures highlight concerns about Genworth's solvency and its decision to prioritize parent company debt repayment over bolstering insurance subsidiaries' capital, increasing GE's financial risk exposure.",
        "Hop 2: Genworth \u2192 UFLIC: UFLIC's trust assets were held in accounts controlled by Genworth subsidiaries, making UFLIC operationally dependent on Genworth's financial health and regulatory standing.",
        "Hop 3: UFLIC \u2190 GE(2023): By 2023, GE explicitly warned that Genworth's solvency issues could lead to regulatory actions affecting UFLIC's trust assets, directly increasing GE's contingent liabilities and negatively impacting its financial services risk exposure."

          "chunk_text": "capital markets, and a significant downgrade could have an adverse commercial impact on our businesses. In addition, swap, forward and option contracts are executed under standard master agreements that typically contain mutual downgrade provisions that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the credit ratings of the applicable GE entity were to fall below specified ratings levels agreed upon with the counterparty. For additional discussion about our current credit ratings and related considerations, refer to the Capital Resources and Liquidity - Credit Ratings and Conditions section within MD&amp;A.\n\nFinancial services operations - We continue to have exposure to insurance, credit, legal and other risks in our financial services operations and, in the event of future adverse developments, may not be able to meet our business and financial objectives without further actions or additional capital contributions . To fund the statutory capital contributions that we expect to make to our insurance subsidiaries over the next several years, as well as to meet our debt maturities and other obligations, we expect to rely on liquidity from our operations. There is a risk that future adverse developments could cause liquidity or funding stress. For example, it is possible that future requirements for capital contributions to the insurance subsidiaries will be greater than currently estimated or could be accelerated by regulators. Our annual testing of insurance reserves is subject to a variety of assumptions, including assumptions about the discount rate (which is sensitive to changes in market interest rates), morbidity, mortality and future long-term care premium increases. Any future adverse changes to these assumptions (to the extent not offset by any favorable changes to these assumptions) could result in an increase to future policy benefit reserves and, potentially, to the amount of capital we are required to contribute to the insurance subsidiaries (as discussed in the Other Items - Insurance section within MD&amp;A). We also anticipate that the new insurance accounting standard scheduled to be effective on January 1, 2023 (as discussed in the Other Items - New Accounting Standards section within MD&amp;A) will materially affect our financial statements and require changes to certain of our processes, systems, and controls. In addition, we continue to evaluate strategic options to accelerate the further reduction in the size of our financial services operations. Some of these options could have a material financial charge or other adverse effects depending on the timing, negotiated terms and conditions of any ultimate arrangements. It is also possible that contingent liabilities and loss estimates from our financial services-related continuing or discontinued operations, such as those related to Bank BPH (see Note 22), will need to be recognized or increase in the future and will become payable. There can be no assurance that future liabilities, losses or impairments to the carrying value of assets within our financial services operations would not materially and adversely affect GE's business, financial position, cash flows, results of operations or capacity to provide financing to support orders at the businesses.\n\nCustomers &amp; counterparties - Global economic, industry-specific or other developments that weaken the soundness of significant customers, governments, financial institutions or other parties we deal with can adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. The business and operating results of our businesses have been, and will continue to be, affected by worldwide economic conditions, including conditions in the air transportation, power generation, renewable energy, healthcare and other industries we serve. Existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services, including large infrastructure projects, and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all as a result of business deterioration, cash flow shortages or difficulty obtaining financing for particular projects or due to macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical disruptions, changes in law or other challenges affecting the strength of the global economy. The airline industry, for example, is highly cyclical, and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the U.S. and international economies. Aviation industry activity is also particularly influenced by a small group of large original equipment manufacturers, as well as large airlines in various geographies, and our credit exposure to some of our largest aviation customers is significant. As described above, the current extended disruption of regional and international air travel from the COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our airframer and airline customers. A potential future disruption in connection with a terrorist incident, cyberattack, actual or threatened public health emergency or recessionary economic environment that results in the loss of business and leisure traffic could also adversely affect these customers, their ability to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all, demand for our products and services and the viability of a customer's business. Secular, cyclical or other pressures facing customers across our energy businesses, including in connection with decarbonization, industry consolidation and competition and shifts in the availability of financing for certain types of power projects or technologies (such as prohibitions on financing for fossil fuel-based projects or technologies), can also have a significant impact on the operating results and outlooks for our businesses operating in those industries. Our financial services operations also have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, including customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging markets, and we transact with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit and other risks in the event of insolvency or other default of its counterparty or client. For example, a portion of our run-off insurance operations' assets are held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts. For UFLIC, such trust assets are currently held in trusts for the benefit of insurance company subsidiaries of Genworth, which during 2021 publicly stated any proceeds from its contingency plan will be used to repay parent company debt and not bolster the capital position of its insurance subsidiaries. Solvency or other concerns about Genworth or its insurance company subsidiaries may cause those subsidiaries or their regulators to take or attempt to take actions that could adversely affect UFLIC, including control over assets in the relevant trusts. In addition, our customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. federal government and state and local entities. We also at times face greater challenges collecting on receivables with customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging markets. If there is significant deterioration in the global economy, in our industries, in financial markets or with particular significant counterparties, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n\nPostretirement benefit plans - Increases in pension, healthcare and life insurance benefits obligations and costs can adversely affect our earnings , cash flows and further progress toward our leverage goals . Our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations, which reflect assumptions about financial markets, interest rates and other economic conditions such as the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

      "question": "How did the change in GE's relationship with UFLIC's structured settlement annuities between 2022 and 2023 impact GE's exposure to mortality risk and capital contribution requirements?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GE's financial services operations, including its relationship with UFLIC, were under pressure due to potential increases in policy benefit reserves and capital contribution requirements driven by adverse changes in assumptions like discount rates and mortality. UFLIC, which reinsured structured settlement annuities from Genworth, faced solvency concerns that could have restricted access to trust assets, increasing GE's risk of needing to inject additional capital. By 2023, GE had adopted ASU 2018-12, which significantly altered the accounting for long-duration insurance contracts like structured settlement annuities. These annuities, numbering around 24,600 and primarily underwritten on impaired lives, exposed GE to long-term mortality risk, with no ability to raise premiums or reduce benefits. The shift from 2022 to 2023 shows that GE's exposure to UFLIC's structured settlement annuities evolved from a potential capital drain due to regulatory and solvency concerns to a more transparent but still significant liability tied to long-term mortality assumptions and interest rate sensitivity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GE(2022) \u2192 UFLIC: GE had exposure to UFLIC's insurance operations, which posed risks due to potential capital contribution requirements and solvency concerns, particularly because of Genworth's stated intention to use trust proceeds for parent debt rather than bolster UFLIC's capital.",
        "Hop 2: UFLIC \u2192 Structured Settlement Annuities: UFLIC produced and reinsured structured settlement annuities, primarily from Genworth, which were long-duration contracts with life contingencies and exposed GE to mortality and longevity risk.",
        "Hop 3: Structured Settlement Annuities \u2190 GE(2023): In 2023, GE adopted ASU 2018-12, which materially affected the accounting for these long-duration contracts. GE reinsured ~24,600 structured settlement annuities with significant exposure to mortality risk and reinvestment risk in a low-interest-rate environment."

          "chunk_text": "capital markets, and a significant downgrade could have an adverse commercial impact on our businesses. In addition, swap, forward and option contracts are executed under standard master agreements that typically contain mutual downgrade provisions that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the credit ratings of the applicable GE entity were to fall below specified ratings levels agreed upon with the counterparty. For additional discussion about our current credit ratings and related considerations, refer to the Capital Resources and Liquidity - Credit Ratings and Conditions section within MD&amp;A.\n\nFinancial services operations - We continue to have exposure to insurance, credit, legal and other risks in our financial services operations and, in the event of future adverse developments, may not be able to meet our business and financial objectives without further actions or additional capital contributions . To fund the statutory capital contributions that we expect to make to our insurance subsidiaries over the next several years, as well as to meet our debt maturities and other obligations, we expect to rely on liquidity from our operations. There is a risk that future adverse developments could cause liquidity or funding stress. For example, it is possible that future requirements for capital contributions to the insurance subsidiaries will be greater than currently estimated or could be accelerated by regulators. Our annual testing of insurance reserves is subject to a variety of assumptions, including assumptions about the discount rate (which is sensitive to changes in market interest rates), morbidity, mortality and future long-term care premium increases. Any future adverse changes to these assumptions (to the extent not offset by any favorable changes to these assumptions) could result in an increase to future policy benefit reserves and, potentially, to the amount of capital we are required to contribute to the insurance subsidiaries (as discussed in the Other Items - Insurance section within MD&amp;A). We also anticipate that the new insurance accounting standard scheduled to be effective on January 1, 2023 (as discussed in the Other Items - New Accounting Standards section within MD&amp;A) will materially affect our financial statements and require changes to certain of our processes, systems, and controls. In addition, we continue to evaluate strategic options to accelerate the further reduction in the size of our financial services operations. Some of these options could have a material financial charge or other adverse effects depending on the timing, negotiated terms and conditions of any ultimate arrangements. It is also possible that contingent liabilities and loss estimates from our financial services-related continuing or discontinued operations, such as those related to Bank BPH (see Note 22), will need to be recognized or increase in the future and will become payable. There can be no assurance that future liabilities, losses or impairments to the carrying value of assets within our financial services operations would not materially and adversely affect GE's business, financial position, cash flows, results of operations or capacity to provide financing to support orders at the businesses.\n\nCustomers &amp; counterparties - Global economic, industry-specific or other developments that weaken the soundness of significant customers, governments, financial institutions or other parties we deal with can adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. The business and operating results of our businesses have been, and will continue to be, affected by worldwide economic conditions, including conditions in the air transportation, power generation, renewable energy, healthcare and other industries we serve. Existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services, including large infrastructure projects, and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all as a result of business deterioration, cash flow shortages or difficulty obtaining financing for particular projects or due to macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical disruptions, changes in law or other challenges affecting the strength of the global economy. The airline industry, for example, is highly cyclical, and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the U.S. and international economies. Aviation industry activity is also particularly influenced by a small group of large original equipment manufacturers, as well as large airlines in various geographies, and our credit exposure to some of our largest aviation customers is significant. As described above, the current extended disruption of regional and international air travel from the COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our airframer and airline customers. A potential future disruption in connection with a terrorist incident, cyberattack, actual or threatened public health emergency or recessionary economic environment that results in the loss of business and leisure traffic could also adversely affect these customers, their ability to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all, demand for our products and services and the viability of a customer's business. Secular, cyclical or other pressures facing customers across our energy businesses, including in connection with decarbonization, industry consolidation and competition and shifts in the availability of financing for certain types of power projects or technologies (such as prohibitions on financing for fossil fuel-based projects or technologies), can also have a significant impact on the operating results and outlooks for our businesses operating in those industries. Our financial services operations also have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, including customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging markets, and we transact with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit and other risks in the event of insolvency or other default of its counterparty or client. For example, a portion of our run-off insurance operations' assets are held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts. For UFLIC, such trust assets are currently held in trusts for the benefit of insurance company subsidiaries of Genworth, which during 2021 publicly stated any proceeds from its contingency plan will be used to repay parent company debt and not bolster the capital position of its insurance subsidiaries. Solvency or other concerns about Genworth or its insurance company subsidiaries may cause those subsidiaries or their regulators to take or attempt to take actions that could adversely affect UFLIC, including control over assets in the relevant trusts. In addition, our customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. federal government and state and local entities. We also at times face greater challenges collecting on receivables with customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging markets. If there is significant deterioration in the global economy, in our industries, in financial markets or with particular significant counterparties, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n\nPostretirement benefit plans - Increases in pension, healthcare and life insurance benefits obligations and costs can adversely affect our earnings , cash flows and further progress toward our leverage goals . Our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations, which reflect assumptions about financial markets, interest rates and other economic conditions such as the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

      "question": "How did the voting power dynamics between UPS's Class B and Class A common stock evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what impact did this have on shareholder equity structure?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UPS maintained a dual-class stock structure where Class B common stock carried higher voting rights compared to Class A common stock. In 2022, there were 732 shares of Class B common stock issued, increasing to 733 shares in 2024. Meanwhile, Class A common stock shares decreased from 147 shares in 2022 to 121 shares in 2024. According to the 2024 evidence, Class B shares typically hold 15 votes per share, giving them a disproportionately higher voting power compared to Class A shares. This structure likely consolidated decision-making authority with Class B shareholders, such as key insiders, while the equity value remained more distributed across Class A shareholders. This dynamic is reflected in the increase in total Shareowners' Equity from $14,269 million in 2022 to $16,743 million in 2024, suggesting a strengthening equity base despite the concentration of voting power.",

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS reported 732 shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding, while in 2024, this number slightly increased to 733 shares. According to the intermediary evidence, Class B common stock holds 33\u2153% of the combined voting power of the company, with each Class B share carrying 15 votes. This non-dilutable structure ensures that Class B stock maintains a fixed percentage of voting power regardless of changes in the number of shares outstanding. Despite the minor increase in Class B shares, the voting power of Class A common stock remained at 66\u2154%, as the Class B voting percentage was preserved. Thus, the small increase in Class B shares did not alter the fundamental voting power dynamics between the two classes of stock.",

In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis.\n\nHolders of Class A common stock in the aggregate hold 66 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock. The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class B common stock having 15 votes per share. The Class B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\nRecord holders as of December 31, 2021 are presented in the table below.\n\n",

      "question": "How did the evolution of RTX's stake in IAE between 2022 and 2024 influence the production and strategic positioning of the PW1100G-JM engine within the Airbus A320neo program?",
      "answer": "In 2022, RTX (through Pratt & Whitney) was deeply involved in the production of the PW1100G-JM engine, a key member of the PW1000G GTF family, which powered the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. By 2024, RTX had consolidated its position in the engine program through its majority ownership in IAE LLC, holding a 59% program share interest and ownership interest. This increased control over IAE LLC, which coordinates the design, development, and manufacturing of the PW1100G-JM engine, allowed RTX to strengthen its strategic positioning in the commercial aviation market. The consolidation of IAE and IAE LLC as variable interest entities, with RTX as the primary beneficiary, reflects a deliberate move to centralize decision-making and economic benefits related to the engine program. This evolution in stakeholder dynamics likely supported more agile development and production decisions for the PW1100G-JM engine, aligning with the growing demand for fuel-efficient engines like the GTF family.",

Pratt &amp; Whitney is among the world's leading suppliers of aircraft engines for commercial, military, business jet and general aviation customers. Pratt &amp; Whitney's Commercial Engines and Military Engines businesses design, develop, produce and maintain families of large engines for wide- and narrow-body and large regional aircraft for commercial customers and for fighter,  bomber, tanker and transport aircraft for military customers. Pratt &amp; Whitney's small engine business, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada (P&amp;WC), is among the world's leading suppliers of engines powering regional airlines, general and business aviation, as well  as  helicopters.  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney  also  produces,  sells  and  services  military  and  commercial  auxiliary  power  units.  Pratt  &amp; Whitney provides fleet management services and aftermarket maintenance, repair and overhaul services in all of these segments.\n\nPratt  &amp;  Whitney  sells  products  and  services  principally  to  aircraft  manufacturers,  airlines  and  other  aircraft  operators,  aircraft leasing companies and the U.S. and foreign governments. Pratt &amp; Whitney's largest commercial customer by sales is Airbus, with sales, prior to discounts and incentives, of 31%, 30% and 31% of total Pratt &amp; Whitney segment sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nPratt &amp; Whitney produces the PW1000G Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine family, the first of which, the PW1100G-JM, entered into service in January 2016. The PW1000G GTF engine has demonstrated a significant reduction in fuel burn and noise levels and lower environmental emissions when compared to legacy engines. The PW1100G-JM engine is offered on the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. PW1000G GTF engine models also power the Airbus A220 passenger aircraft and Embraer's E-Jet E2 family of aircraft and have been certified by the Russian civil aviation authority to power the Irkut MC-21 passenger aircraft. In addition, P&amp;WC's PW800 engine has been selected to exclusively power Gulfstream's G400, G500 and G600 business jets, as well as to power Dassault's Falcon 6X business jet, which is scheduled to enter into service in 2022.\n\nPratt &amp; Whitney is under contract to produce and sustain the F135 engine for the U.S. government's F-35 Joint Program Office to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft (commonly known as the Joint Strike Fighter) produced by Lockheed Martin. F135 propulsion system configurations are used for the U.S Air Force's F-35A, the U.S. Marine Corps' F-35B and the U.S. Navy's F-35C jets. F135 engines are also used on F-35 aircraft purchased by Joint Strike Fighter partner countries and other countries through foreign military sales arrangements. Pratt &amp; Whitney is also under contract to build engines for the U.S. Air Force's B-21 long-range strike bomber and to develop next-generation adaptive engines for the U.S. Air Force.\n\nThe development of new engines and improvements to current production engines present important growth opportunities for Pratt &amp; Whitney. In view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines, Pratt &amp; Whitney has entered into collaboration arrangements in which revenues, costs and risks are shared with third parties. At December 31, 2021, the interests of third-party collaboration participants in Pratt &amp; Whitney-directed jet engine programs ranged, in the aggregate per program, from 13% to 49%. See 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of our  accounting  for  collaboration  arrangements.  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney  also  continues  to  enhance  its  programs  through  performance improvement measures and product base expansion, utilizing similar collaboration arrangements.\n\nIn  2021,  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney  reached  significant  milestones  on  the  GTF  engine  program,  including  the  first  flight  of  the  GTF Advantage engine for the A320neo family. The GTF Advantage configuration further extends the economic and environmental benefits of the existing GTF engine, as it reduces fuel consumption by an additional 1 percent, extending the engine's lead as the most efficient powerplant for the A320neo family. The GTF family now powers more than 1,100 aircraft across 58 airlines and three  aircraft  platforms: Airbus A320neo  family, Airbus A220  and  Embraer  E-Jets  E2. Also  in  2021,  Pratt  &amp; Whitney's V2500 program achieved 250 million flight hours. Pratt &amp; Whitney was announced as the engine provider on the Dassault Falcon 6X and Gulfstream  G400,  representing  two  new  platforms  for  its  PW800  engine.  In  addition,  Pratt  &amp;  Whitney  received  a  significant number of contract awards for the F135 program, which powers all three variants of the F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft and achieved several F135 production milestones, including the delivery of the 800th production engine and continuing to add more F135 engine maintenance, repair, overhaul and upgrade (MRO&amp;U) global capacity by activating MRO&amp;U facilities, or depots, in the Netherlands and Australia. Significant activity continued on development programs, including testing the first XA101 engine as part of the Adaptive Engine Transition Program.",

      "question": "How did General Dynamics' strategic investment in the G500 aircraft in 2022 compare to its ongoing stake in Gulfstream in 2023, and what does this reveal about the company's long-term product development and market positioning strategy in the business jet industry?",
      "answer": "In 2022, General Dynamics highlighted the G500 as a key part of Gulfstream's product lineup, emphasizing its clean-sheet design and role in replacing older models like the G450 and G550, which had an installed base of more than 1,650 aircraft globally. This signaled a strategic investment in next-generation aircraft to maintain technological leadership. In 2023, the company reiterated its long-term value creation strategy, which included sustained R&D investment and customer service capabilities since acquiring Gulfstream over 20 years ago. The continued emphasis on Gulfstream\u2019s product line, including the G500 and G600, showed a consistent commitment to innovation and market leadership. This reveals that General Dynamics' strategy remained focused on leveraging Gulfstream\u2019s brand and product development to maintain dominance in the high-performance business jet market.",

The result is the unprecedented development of an all-new lineup of the most technologically advanced business jet aircraft in the world. The Gulfstream family of aircraft offer industry-leading cabin, cockpit and safety technologies and the longest ranges at the fastest speeds in their respective classes.\n\nThe  following  represents  Gulfstream's  current  product  line,  along  with  the  maximum  range,  maximum speed, cabin length (excluding baggage), and total number of city-pair speed records held for each aircraft:\n\nThe most recent additions to the in-service Gulfstream fleet are two new large-cabin aircraft, the G500 and G600, which entered service in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

By 2023, the company provided a detailed breakdown showing $4,152 million in equity funds within commingled investments, with $446 million classified as Level 1 assets (quoted prices in active markets).

      "question": "How did UPS's equity structure evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of Class A and Class B Common Stock issuance and its impact on total Shareowners' Equity?",
      "answer": "In 2023, UPS reported 127 shares of Class A Common Stock and 726 shares of Class B Common Stock issued, contributing to total Shareowners' Equity of $17,314 million. By 2024, Class A shares decreased to 121 while Class B shares increased to 733, with total Shareowners' Equity declining to $16,743 million. The relationship between Class A and Class B Common Stock, where Class B shares carry more voting rights, remained consistent, but the shift in issuance reflects a strategic realignment in equity structure. Additionally, the introduction of $136 million in Additional Paid-In Capital in 2024 indicates new capital contributions, which may have influenced the equity adjustments despite a decline in total retained earnings.",

        "Hop 1: UPS(2023) \u2192 Class A Common Stock: 127 shares issued, contributing to total Shareowners' Equity of $17,314 million",

        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 UPS(2024): Class B shares increased to 733, while Class A decreased to 121, with total Shareowners' Equity dropping to $16,743 million and Additional Paid-In Capital introduced at $136 million"

By 2024, the relationship had evolved to center around the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (3-Year Facility), dated September 1, 2022, with two subsequent amendments\u2014Amendment No. 1 on August 31, 2023, and Amendment No. 2 on August 29, 2024. This reflects an increased frequency of contractual updates under the new agreement, indicating a more dynamic financial arrangement with Citibank, N.A. as Caterpillar adjusted terms to meet evolving operational or market conditions.",

        "Hop 1: [CAT](2022) \u2192 [Citibank, N.A.]: Caterpillar had a financial partnership with Citibank, N.A. under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (3-Year Facility), with the most recent amendment occurring on September 2, 2021.",
        "Hop 2: [Citibank, N.A.] \u2192 [Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (3-Year Facility)]: Citibank, N.A. was the agent under the updated 3-Year Facility agreement introduced in 2022, indicating a continued but evolved role in Caterpillar\u2019s credit structure.",
        "Hop 3: [CAT](2024) \u2190 [Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (3-Year Facility)]: Caterpillar\u2019s 2024 filings show two amendments to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated August 31, 2023, and August 29, 2024, showing increased contractual activity compared to the 2022 version."

      "answer": "In 2023, GE noted that contingent liabilities and loss estimates from its financial services operations, including UFLIC, could materially affect its financial position and require strategic actions to reduce exposure. By 2024, UFLIC's structured settlement annuities\u2014reinsured by GE\u2014posed specific risks related to mortality assumptions and reinvestment risk in a low-interest environment. GE responded by intensifying its monitoring of actuarial assumptions, including life expectancy trends and reinvestment strategies, to better manage the long-term liabilities tied to these annuities. This reflects a direct evolution from the 2023 concerns about UFLIC\u2019s liabilities to a focused risk management approach in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT CONTRACTS. Refer to the Other Items - Insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimates and assumptions in our insurance reserves and their sensitivity to change. See Notes 1 and 12 for further information.\n\nPENSION ASSUMPTIONS. Refer to Note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nINCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017, substantially all of our unrepatriated net earnings have been subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without significant additional tax cost. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. M ost of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which rely on reasonable estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. A mounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of this, an insignificant amount and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our GE V ernova, GE HealthCare and legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information - Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and 15 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental, health and safety matters, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, government contracts, employee benefit plans, product quality guarantees and losses resulting from other events and developments. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace products is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these products may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. M oreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\n## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumed long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumed long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc. (Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. Presented in the table below are reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(a)    Pending completion of our December 31, 2024 statutory reporting process.\n\nStructured settlement annuities. We reinsure approximately 23,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 57. A pproximately 27% of these structured settlement annuities were underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than-average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment). Unlike long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nLife Insurance contracts. Our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. A t December 31, 2024, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance portfolio, we reinsure approximately $45 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.1 million policies with an average attained age of 63. In 2024, our incurred claims were approximately $0.4 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $46,100. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20- and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20- and 30-year level term policies, which represent approximately 7% and 43% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2026 and 2035 as the policies reach the end of their 20- and 30-year level premium period, respectively.\n\nCritical Accounting E stimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums and are estimated based on actuarial assumptions such as mortality, morbidity, terminations, and expenses. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings. Our annual review procedures include updating certain experience studies since our last completed review, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. The review of experience and assumptions is a comprehensive and complex process that depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. The review relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance portfolio includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.",

      "question": "How did the $31,800 million of assets held in reinsurance trust accounts with ERAC in 2023 relate to GE's ongoing exposure to investment control risks in 2024, particularly given the potential for ceding companies to withdraw these assets?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GE disclosed that its run-off insurance operations held approximately $31,800 million of assets in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts involving ERAC and UFLIC. These assets were subject to investment guidelines outlined in the reinsurance contracts and trust agreements, some of which allowed ceding companies to withdraw trust assets and hold them on their own balance sheets, potentially exercising investment control over those assets. In 2024, GE continued to report exposure to ERAC, which primarily reinsures long-term care and life insurance policies. The continuation of this structure suggests that GE remained exposed to the same investment control risks tied to the terms of these reinsurance trust agreements. Therefore, the $31,800 million in 2023 directly informs the ongoing risk in 2024, as the contractual provisions allowing ceding companies to take control of assets remained in place, maintaining GE\u2019s vulnerability to shifts in asset management and liquidity risks through ERAC.",

          "chunk_text": "INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT CONTRACTS. Refer to the Other Items - Insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimates and assumptions in our insurance reserves and their sensitivity to change. See Notes 1 and 12 for further information.\n\nPENSION ASSUMPTIONS. Refer to Note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nINCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017, substantially all of our unrepatriated net earnings have been subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without significant additional tax cost. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. M ost of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which rely on reasonable estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. A mounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of this, an insignificant amount and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our GE V ernova, GE HealthCare and legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information - Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and 15 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental, health and safety matters, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, government contracts, employee benefit plans, product quality guarantees and losses resulting from other events and developments. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace products is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these products may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. M oreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\n## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumed long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumed long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc. (Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. Presented in the table below are reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS estimated the fair value of its private debt investments using the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the funds, which required subjective adjustments due to the lack of active trading and reliance on fund manager reports. By 2023, UPS disclosed a specific value of $829 million for private debt investments, which were subject to the same NAV-based valuation methodology. The continued reliance on NAV indicates that market conditions for private debt remained such that a readily determinable fair value was not available, and the valuation process remained consistent across the two years.",

In order to estimate NAV, the Company evaluates audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers, and makes adjustments, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. These investments are not actively traded, and their values can only be estimated using these subjective assumptions.\n\nAuditing the estimated NAV of these hedge fund, risk parity, private debt, private equity and real estate investments requires a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity to evaluate the completeness, reliability and relevance of the inputs used by management.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the inputs used by management to estimate the NAV of the U.S. Plans' hedge fund, risk parity, private debt, private equity and real estate investments included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls, including those related to the reliability of values reported by fund managers, the relevance of asset class benchmark returns, and the completeness and accuracy of unobservable inputs related to the underlying assets of the funds.\n- For certain investments, we confirmed directly with the respective fund manager its preliminary estimate of the fund's NAV as of December 31, 2021.\n- For certain investments, we inquired of management to understand year-over-year changes in the fund manager's estimate of NAV and compared the fund's return on investment to other available qualitative and quantitative information relevant to the fund.\n- We evaluated the Company's historical ability to accurately estimate NAV for these funds by comparing each fund's recorded valuation as of its prior fiscal year end to the NA V per the audited fund financial statements (which are received in arrears of the Company's reporting timetable).\n\n## Revenue - Refer to Note 2, Revenue Recognition, to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nApproximately 82 percent of the Company's revenues are from its global small package operations that provide time-definite delivery services for express letters, documents, small packages and palletized freight via air and ground services. The Company's global small package revenues are comprised of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions sourced from systems that were primarily developed by the Company. The processing of transactions, including the recording of them, is highly automated and based on contractual terms with the Company's customers.\n\nAuditing global small package revenue required a significant extent of effort and the involvement of professionals with expertise in information technology ('IT') necessary for us to identify, test, and evaluate the Company's systems, software applications and automated controls.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MMM primarily used foreign exchange forward contracts (\u20ac150 million notional) as part of net investment hedges, with gains/losses recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and only recognized in earnings upon substantial liquidation of foreign subsidiaries. By 2024, MMM shifted toward cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions with a notional value of $9.9 billion, where mark-to-market gains/losses are deferred in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged transactions occur. This shift likely increased the near-term earnings volatility tied to foreign exchange movements but provided more direct protection over specific forecasted cash flows. The change reflects a strategic pivot from long-term balance sheet protection to more immediate cash flow stabilization, aligning with a potentially more dynamic or uncertain foreign exchange environment.",

For instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations and that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or losses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in cumulative translation within other comprehensive income. The remainder of the change in value of such instruments is recorded in earnings. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation. To the extent foreign currency denominated debt is not designated in or is de-designated from a net investment hedge relationship, changes in value of that portion of foreign currency denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are recorded in earnings through their maturity date.\n\n3M's use of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in hedges of the Company's net investment in foreign subsidiaries can vary by time period depending on when foreign currency denominated debt balances designated in such relationships are dedesignated, matured, or are newly issued and designated. Additionally, variation can occur in connection with the extent of the Company's desired foreign exchange risk coverage.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the total notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in net investment hedges was approximately 150 million euros, along with a principal amount of long-term debt instruments designated in net investment hedges totaling 2.9 billion euros. The maturity dates of these derivative and nonderivative instruments designated in net investment hedges range from 2022 to 2031.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe Company may designate pay-fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of interest payments on floating-rate borrowings. Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

Supplier Finance Program Obligations\n\nUnder supplier finance programs, 3M agrees to pay participating banks the stated amount of confirmed invoices from its designated suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices, generally within 90 days of the invoice date. 3M or the banks may terminate the agreements with advance notice. Separately, the banks may have arrangements with the suppliers that provide them the option to request early payment from the banks for invoices confirmed by 3M. 3M's outstanding balances of confirmed invoices in the programs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. These amounts are included within accounts payable on 3M's consolidated balance sheet. The activity in 2024 included approximately $1.5 billion of invoices confirmed and $1.5 billion of invoices paid and other adjustments.\n\n## NOTE 17. Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3M's financial position and performance.\n\nAdditional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:\n\n- Impact on other comprehensive income of non-derivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 9.\n- Fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 18.\n- Derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company's long-term debt are also described in Note 14.\n\nRefer to the section below titled Location on Statement of Income (Loss) and Impact of Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments for details on the location within the consolidated statements of income (loss) for amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow or fair value hedges (along with similar information relative to the hedged items) and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Additional information relative to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included below as applicable.\n\nCash Flow Hedges: For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts: The Company may enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of ex change rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The Company may de-designate a cash flow hedge if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable, if 3M determines that the hedge is no longer expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction, or in certain other circumstances. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income for de-designated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in the value of derivative instruments after de-designation are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments section below. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Interest Rate Contracts: The Company may use forward starting interest rate contracts and treasury rate lock contracts to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments on forecasted debt issuances.\n\nThe amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the gain/(loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had a balance of $15 million associated with the after-tax net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). This includes a remaining balance of $80 million (after-tax loss) related to forward starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock contracts terminated in 2019 concurrent with associated debt issuances, which is being amortized over the respective lives of the underlying notes. Based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, of the total after-tax net unrealized balance as of December 31, 2024, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $44 million after-tax  net unrealized gain over the nex t 12 months (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).",

      "question": "How did the change in the number of issued shares of UPS's Class B Common Stock between 2023 and 2024 influence the company's capital structure, particularly in relation to the voting rights associated with Class A Common Stock?",
      "answer": "In 2023, UPS had 726 shares of Class B Common Stock issued, which increased to 733 shares in 2024. While Class B shares carry no general voting rights, they are entitled to vote in specific circumstances, such as certain corporate transactions or amendments to the certificate of incorporation affecting Class B stock, with voting power tied to the applicable conversion rate. This increase in Class B shares coincided with a decrease in Class A shares issued, from 127 in 2023 to 121 in 2024. Class A shares have full voting rights, so the shift in the composition of common stock may have diluted the proportional voting power of Class A shareholders, affecting corporate governance dynamics. Additionally, the capital structure saw an introduction of 'Additional paid-in capital' at $136 million in 2024, indicating a potential shift in equity composition tied to these stock classifications.",

        "Hop 1: UPS(2023) \u2192 Class B Common Stock: UPS disclosed 726 shares of Class B Common Stock issued in 2023, with no change from 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Class B shares have limited voting rights, only in specific corporate events, and those rights are tied to the conversion rate relative to Class A shares, which have full voting rights.",

      "question": "Given UPS's $3.3 billion in unfunded commitments to private equity funds by 2023, how did the increased exposure to these alternative investments impact the complexity of NAV-based valuations for U.S. benefit plans compared to 2022?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UPS disclosed that private equity funds were among the alternative investments valued using NAV as a practical expedient due to the lack of readily determinable fair value. The pension plan assets were actively managed with a long-term focus on growth and funded status stability, though the expected rate of return on assets had already declined from 7.77% in 2020 to 6.50% in 2021, signaling increased reliance on alternative assets. By 2023, UPS had $3.3 billion in unfunded commitments to private equity and similar funds, which are subject to NAV-based valuations that rely on audited or unaudited financial reports from fund managers, adjusted for activity through year-end. These investments are not actively traded and require subjective assumptions, increasing valuation complexity. Additionally, the 2023 audit highlighted that the U.S. pension plans held $9.9 billion in such alternative investments, further emphasizing the growing reliance on NAV-based valuations. Therefore, the increased exposure to private equity funds from 2022 to 2023 significantly heightened the complexity and subjectivity involved in valuing these assets using NAV.",

          "chunk_text": "## UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 2020 - $10.1 billion pre-tax actuarial loss related to benefit obligation:\n\n- Discount Rates ($7.3 billion pre-tax loss): The weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from 3.55% as of December 31, 2019 to 2.87% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decline in U.S. treasury yields that was slightly offset by an increase in credit spreads on AA-rated corporate bonds.\n- Coordinating benefits attributable to the Central States Pension Fund ($2.3 billion pre-tax loss): This represents our current best estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the Central States Pension Fund before taking into account the impact of the change in discount rates.\n- Demographic and Assumption Changes ($513 million pre-tax loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation changes, rates of termination, retirement, mortality and other changes.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Plan Assets\n\nPension assets are invested in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as investment guidelines established by plan trustees. The strategic asset mixes are specifically tailored for each plan given distinct factors, including liability and liquidity needs. Equities, alternative investments, and other higher yielding assets are utilized to generate returns and promote growth. Derivatives, repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements and fixed income securities are utilized as tools for duration management, mitigating interest rate risk, and minimizing funded status volatility.\n\nThe primary long-term investment objectives for pension assets are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital to meet future obligations while minimizing risk exposures and reducing funded status volatility. To meet these objectives, investment managers are engaged to actively manage assets within the guidelines and strategies set forth by the Investment Committee. Active managers are monitored regularly and their performance is compared to applicable benchmarks. As a result of our long-term U.S. investment objectives for pension assets, the weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on assets decreased from 7.77% during 2020 to 6.50% in 2021.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nPlan assets valued utilizing Level 1 inputs include equity investments, corporate debt instruments and U.S. government securities. Fair values were determined by closing prices for those securities traded on national stock exchanges, while securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on the valuation date are valued at the mean between the last reported bid and ask prices.\n\nLevel 2 assets include fixed income securities that are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of other issues with similar credit ratings; mortgage-backed securities that are valued based on cash flow and yield models using acceptable modeling and pricing conventions; and certain investments that are pooled with other investments in a commingled fund. We value our investments in commingled funds by taking the percentage ownership of the underlying assets, each of which has a readily determinable fair value.\n\nFair value estimates for certain investments are based on unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by observable market data and are thus classified as Level 3.\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a net asset value (\"NAV\") or its equivalent developed consistent with FASB measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, risk parity funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds and risk parity funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31st. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two to three month notice period,",

      "answer": "In 2022, GE applied ASU 2020-04 to manage the transition away from LIBOR in its contracts, particularly for preferred stock and floating-rate debt, which were governed by New York law. This standard allowed GE to replace USD LIBOR with SOFR plus a spread adjustment without triggering significant accounting changes. By 2023, GE disclosed that contract modifications related to long-term service agreements were evaluated for potential price concessions and adjustments to earnings. These modifications occurred in 2021, 2022, and 2023, and the adoption of ASU 2020-04 did not have a material impact on financial statements, though it streamlined the accounting for such changes. The net long-term service agreements balance in 2023 was $(2.1) billion, representing approximately (1.0)% of total estimated life-of-contract billings of $215.3 billion, showing the ongoing financial implications of contract modifications.",

          "chunk_text": "\nOur most significant contractual ratings requirements are related to ordinary course commercial activities. The timing within the quarter of the potential liquidity impact of these areas may differ, as can the remedies to resolving any potential breaches of required ratings levels.\n\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISKS. As a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such principal currencies include the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Indian rupee and Japanese yen, among others. The effects of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings, excluding the earnings impact of the underlying hedged item, was less than $0.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 , 2020 and 2019. This analysis excludes any offsetting effect from the forecasted future transactions that are economically hedged. See Note 20 for further information about our risk exposures, our use of derivatives, and the effects of this activity on our financial statements.\n\nExchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques, including selective use of derivatives. We apply policies to manage each of these risks, including prohibitions on speculative activities. It is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies. To test the effectiveness of our hedging actions, for interest rate risk we assumed that, on January 1, 2022, interest rates decreased by 100 basis points and the decrease remained in place for the next 12 months and for currency risk of assets and liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies, we evaluated the effect of a 10% shift in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (USD). The analyses indicated that our 2021 consolidated net earnings would decline by $0.1 billion for interest rate risk and less than $0.1 billion for foreign exchange risk.\n\nLIBOR REFORM. In connection with the transition away from the use of the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) as an interest rate benchmark, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA) plans to cease the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. The Company's most significant exposures to LIBOR relate to preferred stock and certain floating-rate debt securities issued by the Company, which use USD LIBOR. Such preferred stock and floating rate debt are governed by New York law.\n\nOn April 6, 2021, New York State legislation addressing the cessation of USD LIBOR was signed into law, which provides a statutory remedy for contracts that include contractual fallback language that requires the selection of a benchmark replacement rate based on USD LIBOR, such as our floating rate debt and preferred stock. On the date USD LIBOR permanently ceases to be published or is announced to no longer be representative, our floating rate debt and preferred stock will be deemed to be replaced by the 'recommended benchmark replacement', which is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus a spread adjustment.\n\nAdditionally, with respect to our derivatives portfolio, we are managing the transition from LIBOR based on industry-wide LIBOR reform efforts, including the LIBOR protocols issued by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.\n\nWe are in the process of managing the transition, and any financial impact will be accounted for under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting .\n\n## STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\n\nCASH FLOWS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. The most significant source of cash in CFOA is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from equipment or services sales. The most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities, and post retirement plans. GE measures itself on a free cash flows* basis. This metric includes CFOA plus investments in property, plant and equipment and additions to internal-use software; this metric excludes any cash received from dispositions of property, plant and equipment. We believe that investors may also find it useful to compare free cash flows* performance without the effects of cash flows for taxes related to business sales, contributions to the GE Pension Plan, discontinued factoring programs, operating activities related to our run-off Insurance business and eliminations related to our receivables factoring and supply chain finance programs. We believe this measure will better allow management and investors to evaluate the capacity of our operations to generate free cash flows.\n\nThe CFOA impact from factoring programs discontinued in 2021 of $(5,108) million represents the cash that our industrial businesses would have otherwise collected in the nine months ended December 31, 2021 had customer receivables not been previously sold to WCS or third parties in those discontinued programs. The CFOA impact associated with this activity in factoring programs that have now been discontinued was $(5,847) million and $(3,361) million in the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $(2,487) million. The CFOA impact for the three months ended December 31, 2020 was $(1,377) million. The CFOA impact from receivables factoring and supply chain finance eliminations represents activity related to those internal programs previously facilitated for our industrial segments by our Working Capital Solutions business. We completed the exit from all internal factoring and supply chain finance programs in 2021 and therefore expect no future elimination activity related to these programs.",

      "answer": "In 2023, UPS confirmed that its collectively-bargained contributions satisfied the FIP requirements for the I.A.M. National Pension Fund / National Pension Plan, which was in the red zone and had a financial improvement plan implemented. UPS contributed $50 million to the plan in 2023. By 2024, despite no surcharges being imposed and the plan remaining in the red zone, UPS increased its contribution to $53 million. This indicates that UPS's adherence to FIP requirements in 2023 likely set a baseline for contributions that was maintained and slightly increased in 2024 to continue supporting the underfunded pension plan.",

        "Hop 1: [UPS](2023) \u2192 [FIP Requirements]: UPS satisfied FIP requirements for the I.A.M. National Pension Fund, which was in the red zone, with a 2023 contribution of $50 million.",

        "Hop 3: [I.A.M. National Pension Fund / National Pension Plan] \u2190 [UPS](2024): In 2024, UPS increased its contribution to the same pension fund to $53 million, despite the fund remaining in the red zone and no surcharge being imposed."

      "question": "How did 3M's acquisition of Aearo Technologies in 2008 and subsequent litigation over Dual-Ended Combat Arms Earplugs influence the company's legal liabilities and financial commitments between 2022 and 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, 3M faced ongoing litigation related to Dual-Ended Combat Arms Earplugs originally sold by Aearo Technologies, which it had acquired in 2008. As a result, 3M committed $1.0 billion to fund a trust and an additional $0.2 billion for projected case expenses, reflecting a pre-tax charge of $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2022. The Aearo Entities filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022, leading to their deconsolidation from 3M\u2019s financials. However, in 2023, the bankruptcy court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss, lifting the stay on litigation and prompting 3M to reconsolidate the Aearo Entities. This led to the resumption of mediation and ultimately the CAE Settlement in August 2023, which aimed to resolve all current and future claims related to the earplugs. The legal and financial evolution of this chain shows a shift from a structured bankruptcy-based liability management approach in 2022 to a direct settlement approach in 2023, with significant financial implications across both years.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables\n\nThe Company periodically examines whether the contingent liabilities related to the environmental matters and litigation described above are probable and reasonably estimable based on experience and ongoing developments in those matters, including discussions regarding negotiated resolutions. During 2021, as a result of recent developments in ongoing environmental matters and litigation, the Company increased its accrual for PFAS-related other environmental liabilities by $138 million since December 31, 2020 and made related payments of $142 million. As previously disclosed, in the first and fourth quarters of 2019, in conjunction with other adjustments as a result of developments in then ongoing environmental matters and litigation, 3M recorded pre-tax charges aggregating to $449 million. These pre-tax charges were in light of the EPA issuance of its PFAS Action Plan; the Company's settlement of litigation with the Water Authority; updates to evaluation of certain customer-related litigation based on continued, productive settlement discussions with multiple parties; completion of and then ongoing updates to a comprehensive review with the assistance of environmental consultants and other experts regarding environmental matters and litigation related to historical PFAS manufacturing operations; and expanded evaluation of other 3M sites that may have used certain PFAS-containing materials and locations at which they were disposed. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had recorded liabilities of $412 million for 'other environmental liabilities.' The accruals represent the Company's best estimate of the probable loss in connection with the environmental matters and PFAS-related litigation described above. The Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the established accruals at this time.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had recorded liabilities of $29 million for estimated non-PFAS related 'environmental remediation' costs to clean up, treat, or remove hazardous substances at current or former 3M manufacturing or third-party sites. The Company evaluates available facts with respect to each individual site each quarter and records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the Company's commitment to a plan of action. Liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number, participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions. The Company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change. The Company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to 20 years.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative cleanup methods. Developments may occur that could affect the Company's current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the information available regarding the environmental impact of the Company's operations and products; (ii) changes in environmental regulations, changes in permissible levels of specific compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies, including efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors. For sites included in both 'environmental remediation liabilities' and 'other environmental liabilities,' at which remediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy, including required post-remediation monitoring, the Company believes the exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial condition. However, for locations at which remediation activity is largely ongoing, the Company cannot estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the associated established accruals for the reasons described above.\n\nThe Company has both pre-1986 general and product liability occurrence coverage and post-1985 occurrence reported product liability and other environmental coverage for environmental matters and litigation. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's receivable for insurance recoveries related to the environmental matters and litigation was $8 million. Various factors could affect the timing and amount of recovery of this and future expected increases in the receivable, including (i) delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii) the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future, (iii) the outcome of negotiations with insurers, and (iv) the scope of the insurers' purported defenses and exclusions to avoid coverage.\n\n## Product Liability Litigation\n\nAearo Technologies sold Dual-Ended Combat Arms - Version 2 earplugs starting in about 2003. 3M acquired Aearo Technologies in 2008 and sold these earplugs from 2008 through 2015, when the product was discontinued. In December 2018, a military veteran filed an individual lawsuit against 3M in the San Bernardino Superior Court in California alleging that he sustained personal injuries while serving in the military caused by 3M's Dual-Ended Combat Arms earplugs - Version 2. The plaintiff asserts claims of product liability and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment. The plaintiff seeks various damages, including medical and related expenses, loss of income, and punitive damages.",

      "question": "How did the valuation methodology for UPS's private debt investments in 2023, based on net asset value (NAV), influence the reported NAV-related disclosures in 2024, particularly in relation to unfunded commitments and investment structure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, UPS reported $829 million in private debt investments, which were valued using NAV as a practical expedient due to the lack of readily determinable fair value. These investments were part of broader alternative investments, including private equity and real estate, where NAV was derived from audited financial reports of the respective partnerships, with adjustments for activity through year-end. As of December 31, 2023, UPS had $3.3 billion in unfunded commitments related to these types of limited partnership investments. By 2024, UPS continued to disclose the use of NAV per share or its equivalent for certain investments, indicating that the valuation methodology remained consistent. However, the 2024 disclosures also referenced NAV in the context of broader investment disclosures, including credit risk, foreign currency exchange risk, and commodity risk, suggesting a continued strategic reliance on NAV-based valuation for opaque asset classes like private debt, while managing ongoing capital commitments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS(2023) \u2192 Private Debt: UPS disclosed $829 million in private debt investments, valued using NAV due to lack of market-determined fair value.",
        "Hop 2: Private Debt \u2192 NAV: Private debt was subject to NAV-based valuation as a practical expedient, derived from audited partnership reports with adjustments.",
        "Hop 3: NAV \u2190 UPS(2024): UPS continued to disclose use of NAV per share (or equivalent) in 2024, linking it to risk factors and implying ongoing exposure to private debt structures."

      "question": "What strategic implications can be drawn from Caterpillar reducing authorized shares in their Long-Term Incentive Plan from 74.8 million in 2022 to 42.5 million in 2024, and how did this affect their use of Treasury stock for compensation in the transition year of 2023?",
      "answer": "The reduction in authorized shares from 74.8 million under the 2014 Plan as of 2022 to 42.5 million under the newly approved 2023 Plan in 2024 indicates a strategic tightening of Caterpillar\u2019s stock-based compensation capacity. This was accompanied by a decline in Treasury stock issuances, which totaled 2,497,799 shares in 2023\u2014the transition year\u2014down from 5,317,243 shares in 2022 and 5,126,379 in 2019 under the earlier plan. The change suggests a more conservative approach to equity compensation, potentially signaling reduced reliance on stock grants or a desire to limit share dilution. The 2023 Plan also absorbed returned shares from the 2014 Plan upon cancellation or tax withholding, which helped maintain some flexibility despite the lower overall authorization.",

Stock-based compensation\n\nOur stock-based compensation plans primarily provide for the granting of stock options, restricted  stock  units  (RSUs)  and performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs) to Officers and other key employees, as well as non-employee Directors. Stock options permit a holder to buy Caterpillar stock at the stock's price when the option was granted. RSUs are agreements to issue shares of Caterpillar stock at the time of vesting. PRSUs are similar to RSUs and include performance conditions in the vesting terms of the award.\n\nOur long-standing practices and policies specify that the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors approve all stock-based compensation awards.  The award approval process specifies the grant date, value and terms of the award.    We  consistently  apply  the  same  terms  and  conditions  to  all  employee  grants,  including  Officers.  The  Committee approves all  individual  Officer  grants.   We  determine  the  number  of  stock-based  compensation  award  units  included  in  an individual's award based on the methodology approved by the Committee. The exercise price methodology approved by the Committee is the closing price of the Company stock on the date of the grant. In June of 2014, shareholders approved the Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plan) under which all new stock-based compensation awards are granted. In  June  of  2017,  shareholders  amended  and  restated  the  Plan.  The  Plan  initially  provided  that  up  to  38,800,000  Common Shares  would  be  reserved  for  future  issuance  under  the  Plan,  subject  to  adjustment  in  certain  events.  Subsequent  to  the shareholder  approval  of  the  amendment  and  restatement  of  the  Plan,  an  additional  36,000,000  Common  Shares  became available for all awards under the Plan.\n\nCommon stock issued from Treasury stock under the plans totaled 3,571,503 for 2021, 5,317,243 for 2020 and 5,126,379 for 2019. The total number of shares authorized for equity awards under the amended and restated Caterpillar Inc. 2014 LongTerm Incentive Plan is 74,800,000, of which 33,880,674 shares remained available for issuance as of December 31, 2021.\n\nStock option and RSU awards generally vest according to a three-year graded vesting schedule. One-third of the award will become vested on the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third of the award will become vested on the second anniversary of  the  grant  date  and  one-third  of  the  award  will  become  vested  on  the  third  anniversary  of  the  grant  date.  PRSU  awards generally have a three-year performance period and cliff vest at the end of the period based upon achievement of performance targets established at the time of grant.\n\nUpon separation from service, if the participant is 55 years of age or older with more than five years of service, the participant meets the criteria for a 'Long Service Separation.'  Award terms for stock option and RSU grants allow for continued vesting as of each vesting date specified in the award document for employees who meet the criteria for a 'Long Service Separation' and fulfill a requisite service period of six months.  We recognize compensation expense for eligible employees for the grants over the period from the grant date to the end date of the six-month requisite service period.  For employees who become eligible for a 'Long Service Separation' subsequent to the end date of the six-month requisite service period and prior to the completion  of  the  vesting  period,  we  recognized  compensation  expense  over  the  period  from  the  grant  date  to  the  date eligibility is achieved.\n\nAward terms for PRSU grants allow for continued vesting upon achievement of the performance target specified in the award document for employees who meet the criteria for a 'Long Service Separation' and fulfill a requisite service period of six months. We recognize compensation expense for the PRSU grants with respect to employees who have met the criteria for a 'Long  Service  Separation'  over  the  period  from  the  grant  date  to  the  end  of  the  six-month  requisite  service  period.  For employees who become eligible for a 'Long Service Separation' subsequent to the end date of the six-month requisite service period and prior to the completion of the vesting period, we recognize compensation expense over the period from the grant date to the date eligibility is achieved.\n\nAt grant, option awards have a term life of ten years.  For awards granted prior to 2016, if the 'Long Service Separation' criteria are met, the vested options have a life that is the lesser of ten years from the original grant date or five years from the separation date.  For awards granted beginning in 2016, the vested options have a life equal to ten years from the original grant date.",

Stock-based compensation\n\nOur stock-based compensation plans primarily provide for the granting of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs) to Officers and other key employees, as well as non-employee Directors. Stock options permit a holder to buy Caterpillar stock at the stock's price when the option was granted. RSUs are agreements to issue shares of Caterpillar stock at the time of vesting. PRSUs are similar to RSUs and include performance conditions in the vesting terms of the award.\n\nOur  long-standing  practices  and  policies  specify  that  the  Compensation  Committee  (the  Committee)  of  the  Board  of  Directors  approve  all  stock-based compensation  awards.    The  award  approval  process  specifies  the  grant  date,  value  and  terms  of  the  award.    We  consistently  apply  the  same  terms  and conditions  to  all  employee  grants,  including  Officers.  The  Committee  approves  all  individual  Officer  grants.    We  determine  the  number  of  stock-based compensation award units included in an individual's award based on the methodology approved by the Committee. The exercise price methodology approved by the Committee is the closing price of the Company stock on the date of the grant. In June of 2014, shareholders approved the Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan) under which all new stock-based compensation awards were granted. In June of 2023, shareholders approved the Caterpillar Inc. 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2023 Plan), which superseded and replaced the 2014 Plan.\n\nCommon stock issued from Treasury stock under the plans totaled 1,972,037  for  2024, 2,497,799 for 2023 and 2,340,887  for  2022. The total number of shares authorized for equity awards under the 2023 Plan is 42,500,000. As of December 31, 2024, 40,873,176 shares remained available for issuance, which includes shares returned to the 2023 Plan upon cancellation or shares withheld for taxes incurred in connection with issuance or vesting of grants made under the 2014 Plan.\n\nStock  option  and  RSU  awards  generally  vest  according  to  a three-year  graded  vesting  schedule.

      "question": "How did the change in Emerson's relationship with AspenTech from 2022 to 2023 impact the structure and vesting conditions of Performance Stock Units offered under AspenTech's equity compensation plans?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Emerson disclosed a complete exit from AspenTech, with its stake dropping to zero, following the acquisition of Heritage AspenTech. By 2023, AspenTech had introduced Performance Stock Units (PSUs) with vesting tied to predefined goals such as annual contract value and free cash flows, allowing up to 175% vesting upon exceeding targets. This represents a strategic shift from Emerson's direct ownership to AspenTech independently managing its equity compensation. The PSUs, which vest over three years, reflect AspenTech's post-spinoff focus on performance-based incentives, a change from Emerson\u2019s prior reporting of AspenTech's financials as part of its consolidated disclosures.",

        "Hop 1: EMR(2022) \u2192 AspenTech: Emerson fully exited its stake in AspenTech by 2022, as shown in the financial table where AspenTech's value dropped to $0 million in 2022 from $2 million in 2021.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the UPS Retirement Plan ceased accruals of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants, effective January 1, 2023, and introduced a defined contribution model where non-union employees received annual retirement contributions of 5% to 8% of eligible compensation to the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan based on years of vesting service. These contributions were subject to IRS limits on tax-qualified defined contribution plans. In 2024, UPS adjusted this model further, reducing the base contribution for certain non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2025, to 3% of eligible compensation, regardless of vesting service, while still operating within IRS-defined contribution limits.

COMPANY-SPONSORED EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\n\nWe sponsor various retirement, postretirement and pension plans, including defined benefit and defined contribution plans, which cover our employees worldwide.\n\n## U.S. Pension Benefits\n\nIn the U.S. we maintain the following single-employer defined benefit pension plans:\n\n- The UPS Retirement Plan is noncontributory and includes substantially all eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries hired prior to July 1, 2016 who are not members of a collective bargaining unit, as well as certain employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on average compensation earned by employees prior to retirement. Benefits payable under this plan are subject to maximum compensation limits and the annual benefit limits for a tax -qualified defined benefit plan as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS'). The plan ceased accruals of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective January 1, 2023.\n- The UPS Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes certain eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries and members of collective bargaining units that elect to participate in the plan. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\n- The UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes employees that were previously members of the Central States Pension Fund (\"CSPF\"), a multiemployer pension plan, in addition to other eligible employees who are covered under certain collective bargaining agreements. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\n- The UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain participants in the UPS Retirement Plan, hired prior to July 1, 2016, for amounts that ex ceed the benefit limits described above. The plan ceased accruals of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective January 1, 2023\n\nRefer to note 6 for the status of our collective bargaining agreements.\n\n## International Pension Benefits\n\nWe also sponsor various defined benefit plans covering certain of our international employees. The majority of our international obligations are for defined benefit plans in Canada and the United Kingdom. In addition, many of our international employees are covered by government-sponsored retirement and pension plans. We are not directly responsible for providing benefits to participants of government-sponsored plans.\n\nDuring 2022, we amended certain Canadian defined benefit pension plans to cease future benefit accruals effective December 31, 2023. We remeasured plan assets and benefit obligations for the plans, which resulted in curtailment gains of $34 million ($24 million after tax ). These gains were included in Investment income (expense) and other in our statement of consolidated income for the year ended December 31, 2022.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits\n\nWe also sponsor postretirement medical plans in the U.S. that provide healthcare benefits to certain non-union retirees, as well as select union retirees who meet certain eligibility requirements and who are not otherwise covered by multiemployer plans. Generally, this includes employees with at least 10 years of service who have reached age 55 and employees who are eligible for postretirement medical benefits from a company-sponsored plan pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. We have the right to modify or terminate certain of these plans. These benefits have been provided to certain retirees on a noncontributory basis; however, in many cases, retirees are required to contribute all or a portion of the total cost of the coverage.\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nWe sponsor a defined contribution plan for employees not covered under collective bargaining agreements, and several smaller defined contribution plans for certain employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. We match, in cash, a portion of the participating employees' contributions. Matching contributions charged to expense were $161, $161 and $153 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nBeginning in 2023, non-union employees, including those previously accruing benefits in the UPS Retirement Plan, receive an annual retirement contribution of 5% to 8% (3% to 8% prior to 2023 for employees hired after July 1, 2016) of eligible compensation to the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan based on years of vesting service. Effective January 1, 2025, the UPS Retirement Plan contribution for certain non-union employees with an employment commencement date on or after January 1, 2025 is 3% of eligible compensation, regardless of years of vesting service. Retirement contributions charged to expense were $359, $380 and $83 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan provides for transition contributions to certain participants hired prior to 2008. The amounts charged to expense for transition contributions were $108 and $128 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were no transition contributions in years prior to 2023.\n\nContributions under this plan are subject to maximum compensation and contribution limits for a tax-qualified defined contribution plan as prescribed by the IRS. The UPS Restoration Savings Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain participants in the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan for amounts that exceed these benefit limits.\n\nContributions are also made to defined contribution money purchase plans under certain collective bargaining agreements. Amounts charged to expense were $135, $132 and $119 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nWe also sponsor certain international defined contribution plans, which are not individually material.\n\n## Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n\nInformation about net periodic benefit cost for the company-sponsored pension and postretirement defined benefit plans is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, UPS disclosed 127 shares of Class A common stock issued, which decreased to 121 shares in 2024, while Class B common stock increased from 726 to 733 shares. According to the evidence, Class B shares are convertible on a one-for-one basis into Class A shares, suggesting potential future shifts in ownership structure. Despite this, the total equity for controlling interests decreased from $17,306 million in 2023 to $16,718 million in 2024. This decline indicates that the conversion dynamics and stock adjustments did not result in an increase in equity, but rather a reduction, potentially due to other financial or operational factors affecting retained earnings or accumulated comprehensive loss.",

      "answer": "In 2022, BA reported $142 million in sales-type/finance leases tied to MD-80 Aircraft, a legacy aircraft model. By 2023, this figure had dropped to zero, indicating a strategic exit from financing this aircraft type. This change was part of a broader shift in BA's leasing portfolio, where the company reduced its exposure to older aircraft models like the MD-80 and focused instead on newer platforms such as the 747-8 and 737 families. The removal of MD-80 Aircraft from the sales-type lease category in 2023 suggests BA may have liquidated or transitioned these assets, aligning with a modernization strategy reflected in both the leasing structure and asset mix.",

      "answer": "In 2023, UPS had unfunded commitments to private equity, private debt, and real estate funds totaling approximately $3.3 billion, which decreased to $2.7 billion by the end of 2024. This $600 million reduction indicates a tightening of UPS's exposure to illiquid alternative investments over the period. The company's disclosures around NAV as a valuation method remained consistent, using the most recent partnership audited financial reports adjusted for investment activity, suggesting that while the liquidity strategy evolved, the accounting policy for these investments did not. The decrease in unfunded commitments may signal a more conservative stance toward capital allocation in long-term, less liquid assets, potentially in response to broader market conditions or internal liquidity planning.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

      "question": "How did Lockheed Martin's helicopter delivery strategy to Thailand in 2023 compare with its operational expansion in the Philippines in 2024, given the ongoing geopolitical tensions between these two countries?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Lockheed Martin was actively supporting helicopter delivery programs to Thailand, specifically mentioning the S-70 Black Hawk and MH-60 Seahawk helicopters as part of its international business segment (RMS), with Thailand listed among key international customers. International customers accounted for 31% of RMS' net sales in 2023. In 2024, the company expanded its operational presence in the Philippines, explicitly stating it was providing development, production, and sustainment support for S-70 Black Hawk and MH-60 Seahawk helicopters to the Philippines as part of its RMS business segment, where international customers accounted for 32% of net sales. This shift occurred amid ongoing geopolitical tensions between Thailand and the Philippines, highlighted by a long-standing WTO dispute over customs and tax measures affecting cigarette imports, which had not been resolved by 2024 despite bilateral discussions. The evidence shows that Lockheed Martin maintained its supply chain relationship with Thailand while simultaneously deepening its operational footprint in the Philippines, suggesting a strategic balancing of defense partnerships despite regional political friction.",

          "chunk_text": "## Governmental Investigations\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters, including tax, customs, antitrust, advertising, and labor practices. We describe certain pending matters in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies .\n\nIn November 2010, a World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") panel issued its decision in a dispute between the Philippines and Thailand, concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\") into Thailand. The decision concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the Thai government and created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports.  Thailand agreed to fully comply with the decision, but the Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision and commenced challenges at the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO Appellate Body is not operational, and the appeals by Thailand are suspended indefinitely. In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues and the countries have since agreed to seek the establishment of a bilateral consultative mechanism, with the goal of reaching a comprehensive settlement of their dispute, consistent with their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreements, as well as the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families in the country. We continue commercial activities in select locations where safety allows, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and supplies the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement. Production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended. On June 20, 2023, we announced the investment of $30 million in a new production facility in the Lviv region, in Western Ukraine. Preparatory work for the facility began in July 2023. The new production facility was completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and local production commenced in April 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our Ukrainian operations had approximately $0.6 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances.\n\nIn Russia, we are continuously assessing the evolving situation in the country. This includes regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. As of December 31, 2024, our Russian operations had approximately $2.7 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $1.0 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles).\n\nAdditionally, we hold a 23% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution B.V ., which was the holding company of JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), pursuant to Dutch law, PMI's distributor in Russia. On July 18, 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Trade filed a petition before the Arbitrazh Court of Moscow seeking the forced localization of JSC TK Megapolis. On December 5, 2024, JSC TK Megapolis registered the transfer of this equity interest to PMI affiliate ZAO Philip Morris Izhora. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. Related Parties - Equity Investments and Other and Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies.\n\nThese developments above have or may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in impairment charges.\n\nFor further details, see Item 1A. Risk Factors , Item 8, Note 4. War in Ukraine and the \"Trade Policy \" section of this Item 7.\n\n## Impact of Inflation on Our Business and Mitigation E fforts\n\nLike many other global companies, we have experienced inflationary pressures in 2022, 2023 and 2024, including: growing pressures on the cost of certain direct materials, wages, energy, transportation, and logistics as well as an increased cost of capital due to interest rate increases driven by the response to increased inflation. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact on cost of sales was approximately $580 million. In 2024, the impact on cost of sales was approximately 30% of the 2023 level, benefiting from lower prices for direct materials and utilities, despite continued pressure on tobacco leaf costs. In 2025, we expect certain inflationary elements such as direct materials and utilities to stabilize, with a moderate overall increase in inflationary pressures driven by tobacco leaf costs.\n\nInflationary impacts driven by higher wages have resulted from merit increases that reflect local inflation as we continuously evaluate our compensation and benefit offerings to be competitive with the current market. Increased transportation costs resulted from increased shipping rates for all modes of transportation (air, ocean and inland) due to ocean and air capacity constraints. Increases in",

Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the PAC-3 and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems. Seventeen nations have chosen PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) to provide missile defense capabilities. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical and strike missile products, where we received orders from Poland for precision fire systems and for Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM).\n\nIn 2024, international customers accounted for 32% of RMS' net sales. Our RMS business segment continues to experience international interest in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System (Aegis) for which we perform activities in the development, production, modernization, ship integration, test and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, the Republic of Korea and Australia. We have ongoing combat systems programs associated with different classes of surface combatant ships for customers in Canada, Chile and New Zealand. Our Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC) program will provide surface combatant ships for international customers, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, designed to operate in shallow waters and the open ocean. In our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Canada, Singapore, Australia, G ermany and France. We have active development, production and sustainment support of the S-70 Black Hawk and MH-60 Seahawk helicopters to international customers, including  India,  Philippines, Australia,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Thailand,  the  Kingdom  of  Saudi Arabia  and  G reece.  Commercial  aircraft  are  sold  to  international customers to support search and rescue missions as well as VIP and offshore oil and gas transportation.\n\n## Status of the F-35 Program\n\nThe F-35 program primarily consists of production contracts, sustainment activities, and new development efforts. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. G overnment's objective of procuring 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy. We also have commitments from seven international partner countries and twelve FMS customers. We continue to see strong international demand for the F-35, with the Czech Republic signing an LOA in January 2024 to procure 24 F-35s, Singapore announcing in February 2024 its intent to purchase eight additional F-35s, and G reece signing an LOA in July 2024 to procure 20 F-35s. In November 2024, Romania signed an LOA to procure 32 aircraft, becoming the 20th nation to join the F-35 program. We expect international interest to continue to expand in the coming years.\n\nFrom program inception through December 31, 2024, we have delivered 1,102 production F-35 aircraft, including 797 F-35A variants, 203 F-35B variants and 102 F-35C variants, and our backlog as of that date was 408 aircraft, demonstrating the F-35 program's continued progress and longevity. We resumed F-35 deliveries in the third quarter of 2024, after delivering none in the first half of the year, and delivered 106 Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) configured aircraft and four TR-2 configured aircraft in 2024. We continue to advance TR-3 and Block 4 capabilities to support our customers' mission requirements.\n\nIn December 2024, Lockheed Martin and the Joint Program Office (JPO) reached an agreement for an undefinitized contract action for Lot 18 F-35 Air V ehicle Production Contract for 145 aircraft. The scope includes aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marines and the International Partners and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers, in addition to the required infrastructure for the international Final Assembly and Checkout Facilities (FACOs) and other equipment. While we continue to engage with the U.S. G overnment to definitize the contract, this agreement allowed us to recognize approximately $700 million of sales and associated operating profit deferred from the third quarter of 2024 into the fourth quarter of 2024. We were also able to invoice and collect cash of approximately $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter for costs incurred. Lot 19 was negotiated concurrently with Lot 18, and both Lots are expected to be fully awarded in 2025.\n\nThe F-35 program is significant and complex and we and our customers continually review aircraft performance, program and delivery schedule, cost and supply chain issues, and requirements as part of our internal program management efforts and the DoD, Congressional and international countries' oversight and budgeting processes. Areas of particular focus currently include Lockheed Martin's and our suppliers' performance, software maturation related to TR-3 capability and software development more generally, flight test execution, cost of life cycle operations, sustainment, inflation-related cost and supply chain-related cost and schedule pressures, and efforts to increase affordability.\n\n## Backlog\n\nAt December 31, 2024, our backlog was $176.0 billion compared with $160.6 billion at December 31, 2023. Backlog is converted into sales in future periods as work is performed or deliveries are made. We expect to recognize approximately 35%",

      "question": "How did the change in Lockheed Martin's (2023 vs. 2024) financial exposure to commercial customers influence the equity earnings from their investment in ULA, particularly in light of ULA's launch volume performance in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Lockheed Martin reported $749 million in receivables from commercial customers, indicating a notable level of financial exposure to this segment. This exposure likely included downstream effects from their joint venture ULA, which provides launch services to both U.S. Government and commercial customers. By 2024, equity earnings from ULA increased to $45 million (from $20 million in 2023), representing a 125% growth, which was attributed to higher launch volume. This increase in equity earnings suggests that either ULA\u2019s commercial launch business grew or the financial performance of those launches improved, which may have been supported by Lockheed Martin\u2019s broader commercial customer engagement in prior years. The evolution of this chain shows how earlier financial ties with commercial customers (2023) translated into stronger returns from ULA (2024) due to increased operational activity.",

This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a fixedprice incentive fee contract and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. Since 2016, the USAF has authorized seven low rate initial production (LRIP) lots for a total of 94 aircraft. The EMD contract and authorized LRIP lots are valued at approximately $19 billion as of December 31, 2021.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had approximately $243 of capitalized precontract costs and $409 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers.\n\n## Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts\n\nOur final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed.

The U.S. government contracting party  may  modify,  curtail  or  terminate  its  contracts  and  subcontracts  with  us,  without  prior  notice  and  either  at  its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such  as  'continuing  resolutions'  rather  than  full-year  appropriations.  Any  loss  or  anticipated  loss  or  reduction  of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable  under  U.S.  government  contracts. U.S.  government  agencies,  including  the  Defense  Contract  Audit Agency  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency,  routinely  audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.\n\n## We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.\n\nOur BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 68% and 69% of their 2021 revenues from fixed-price contracts.  While  fixed-price  contracts  enable  us  to  benefit  from  performance  improvements,  cost  reductions  and efficiencies,  they  also  subject  us  to  the  risk  of  reduced  margins  or  incurring  losses  if  we  are  unable  to  achieve estimated costs and revenues. In addition, increased compliance costs and costs due to loss of productivity due to COVID-19 may not be reimbursed. If  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  price,  we  recognize  reach-forward losses  which  can  significantly  affect  our  reported  results.  For  example  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  recorded additional losses of $402 million on the KC-46A Tanker contract reflecting continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the  process  of  estimating  costs  and  revenues  on  fixed-price  contracts  inherently  risky.  Fixed-price  contracts  often contain  price  incentives  and  penalties  tied  to  performance,  which  can  be  difficult  to  estimate  and  have  significant impacts  on  margins.  In  addition,  some  of  our  contracts  have  specific  provisions  relating  to  cost,  schedule  and performance.\n\nFixed-price  development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  Examples  of  significant  BDS  fixed-price  development  contracts include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military satellites.",

We plan to gradually increase the production rate.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 55 737-8 aircraft in inv entory that were produced prior to 2023, including approximately 40 aircraft for customers in China. We expect to deliv er these aircraft in 2025.\n\nWe are continuing to work through the certification  process  of  the  737-7  and  737-10  models,  which  hav e  been  delayed,  while  we  work  through  the engineering solution for the engine anti-ice system for the 737-7 and 737-10 prior to certification of these minor models. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 35 737-7 and 737-10 aircraft in inv entory. We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.\n\nThe production slow-down, the IAM 751 work stoppage and new agreement, and the timing of minor model certifications hav e had an adv erse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows during 2024. If we are unable to deliv er aircraft and/or increase future production rates, or certify the 737-7 and 737-10 models consistent with our assumptions, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows will continue to be adversely affected.\n\nSee further discussion of the 737 MAX  in Note 8 and Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements .\n\n767  Program T he  767  assembly  line  includes  the  commercial  program  and  a  deriv ativ e  to  support  the  KC-46A  T anker  program.  We  are  currently targeting a production rate of approximately 3 aircraft per month. Prior to the IAM 751 work stoppage, we experienced factory disruption, including supply chain delays and quality issues. We slowed production to reduce trav eled work and enable supply chain recov ery, which resulted in higher near-term production costs. Production resumed in December 2024.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we decided to end production of the 767 freighter program in 2027 and, as a result of this decision, we reduced the accounting quantity for the 767 program by 9 units. Impacts of this decision, as well as the IAM 751 work stoppage and contract negotiations, and higher costs driv en by ongoing factory disruption resulted in a reach-forward loss of $398 million during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we reduced the accounting quantity by 7 units. We now expect to end production in late 2026 or early 2027. We recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $182 million as a result of the reduction in the accounting quantity and the new IAM 751 agreement.\n\nSee further discussion of the KC-46A Tanker program in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n777 and 777X Programs T he  accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 32 units during the year ended December 31, 2024, due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and deliv ering airplanes. The accounting quantity for the 777X  program remained unchanged during 2024.",

      "question": "How did UPS's compliance with FIP requirements in 2023 influence its contribution levels to the New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund in 2024, particularly given the Fund's red zone status and UPS's historical contribution pattern?",
      "answer": "UPS satisfied all FIP requirements in 2023, including those for the New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund, which was in the red zone and had a financial improvement plan implemented. In 2023, UPS contributed $139 million to this Fund, and in 2024, the contribution decreased slightly to $136 million. This reflects a minor adjustment in UPS's contribution strategy despite ongoing compliance obligations under the FIP and the Fund\u2019s continued red zone status, indicating a stable but slightly reduced financial commitment.",

        "Hop 1: [UPS](2023) \u2192 [FIP Requirements]: UPS satisfied all implemented FIP requirements, including those for the New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund, with no surcharges imposed.",
        "Hop 2: [FIP Requirements] \u2192 [New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund]: The Fund was subject to a FIP in both 2023 and 2024 due to its red zone status, requiring UPS to comply with specific funding rules.",
        "Hop 3: [New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund] \u2190 [UPS](2024): UPS contributed $136 million to the Fund in 2024, down from $139 million in 2023, despite the Fund remaining in the red zone and under FIP."

      "question": "How did GE's approach to managing fiduciary assets change between 2022 and 2023, particularly regarding the $31.0 billion in trust assets subject to reinsurance agreements and the updated pension investment strategies involving liability hedging programs?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GE disclosed that approximately $31.0 billion of assets held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts were subject to specific investment guidelines set by reinsurance agreements. These assets were managed under the terms of those contracts, with some allowing ceding companies to exert investment control over trust assets. By 2023, GE's pension plan fiduciaries had adopted a more structured investment strategy that included liability hedging programs and the use of long-dated corporate bonds, treasuries, and derivatives to manage asset-liability risk. This represents a shift from reliance on contractual investment frameworks to a more proactive, risk-balanced approach in managing fiduciary assets, particularly in the pension context.",

In addition, swap, forward and option contracts are executed under standard master agreements that typically contain mutual downgrade provisions that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the credit ratings of the applicable GE entity were to fall below specified ratings levels agreed upon with the counterparty. For additional discussion about our current credit ratings and related considerations, refer to the Capital Resources and Liquidity - Credit Ratings and Conditions section within MD&amp;A.\n\nFinancial services operations - We continue to have exposure to insurance, credit, legal and other risks in our financial services operations and, in the event of future adverse developments, may not be able to meet our business and financial objectives without further actions or additional capital contributions . To fund the statutory capital contributions that we expect to make to our insurance subsidiaries over the next several years, as well as to meet our debt maturities and other obligations, we expect to rely on liquidity from our operations. There is a risk that future adverse developments could cause liquidity or funding stress. For example, it is possible that future requirements for capital contributions to the insurance subsidiaries will be greater than currently estimated or could be accelerated by regulators. Our annual testing of insurance reserves is subject to a variety of assumptions, including assumptions about the discount rate (which is sensitive to changes in market interest rates), morbidity, mortality and future long-term care premium increases. Any future adverse changes to these assumptions (to the extent not offset by any favorable changes to these assumptions) could result in an increase to future policy benefit reserves and, potentially, to the amount of capital we are required to contribute to the insurance subsidiaries (as discussed in the Other Items - Insurance section within MD&amp;A). We also anticipate that the new insurance accounting standard scheduled to be effective on January 1, 2023 (as discussed in the Other Items - New Accounting Standards section within MD&amp;A) will materially affect our financial statements and require changes to certain of our processes, systems, and controls. In addition, we continue to evaluate strategic options to accelerate the further reduction in the size of our financial services operations. Some of these options could have a material financial charge or other adverse effects depending on the timing, negotiated terms and conditions of any ultimate arrangements. It is also possible that contingent liabilities and loss estimates from our financial services-related continuing or discontinued operations, such as those related to Bank BPH (see Note 22), will need to be recognized or increase in the future and will become payable. There can be no assurance that future liabilities, losses or impairments to the carrying value of assets within our financial services operations would not materially and adversely affect GE's business, financial position, cash flows, results of operations or capacity to provide financing to support orders at the businesses.\n\nCustomers &amp; counterparties - Global economic, industry-specific or other developments that weaken the soundness of significant customers, governments, financial institutions or other parties we deal with can adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. The business and operating results of our businesses have been, and will continue to be, affected by worldwide economic conditions, including conditions in the air transportation, power generation, renewable energy, healthcare and other industries we serve. Existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services, including large infrastructure projects, and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all as a result of business deterioration, cash flow shortages or difficulty obtaining financing for particular projects or due to macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical disruptions, changes in law or other challenges affecting the strength of the global economy. The airline industry, for example, is highly cyclical, and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the U.S. and international economies. Aviation industry activity is also particularly influenced by a small group of large original equipment manufacturers, as well as large airlines in various geographies, and our credit exposure to some of our largest aviation customers is significant. As described above, the current extended disruption of regional and international air travel from the COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our airframer and airline customers. A potential future disruption in connection with a terrorist incident, cyberattack, actual or threatened public health emergency or recessionary economic environment that results in the loss of business and leisure traffic could also adversely affect these customers, their ability to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all, demand for our products and services and the viability of a customer's business. Secular, cyclical or other pressures facing customers across our energy businesses, including in connection with decarbonization, industry consolidation and competition and shifts in the availability of financing for certain types of power projects or technologies (such as prohibitions on financing for fossil fuel-based projects or technologies), can also have a significant impact on the operating results and outlooks for our businesses operating in those industries. Our financial services operations also have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, including customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging markets, and we transact with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit and other risks in the event of insolvency or other default of its counterparty or client. For example, a portion of our run-off insurance operations' assets are held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts. For UFLIC, such trust assets are currently held in trusts for the benefit of insurance company subsidiaries of Genworth, which during 2021 publicly stated any proceeds from its contingency plan will be used to repay parent company debt and not bolster the capital position of its insurance subsidiaries. Solvency or other concerns about Genworth or its insurance company subsidiaries may cause those subsidiaries or their regulators to take or attempt to take actions that could adversely affect UFLIC, including control over assets in the relevant trusts. In addition, our customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. federal government and state and local entities. We also at times face greater challenges collecting on receivables with customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging markets. If there is significant deterioration in the global economy, in our industries, in financial markets or with particular significant counterparties, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n\nPostretirement benefit plans - Increases in pension, healthcare and life insurance benefits obligations and costs can adversely affect our earnings , cash flows and further progress toward our leverage goals . Our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations, which reflect assumptions about financial markets, interest rates and other economic conditions such as the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

Assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contracts and trust agreements. Some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of ERAC or UFLIC which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates and benefit utilization rates); morbidity improvement (i.e., assumed rate of improvement in morbidity in the future); mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force); anticipated premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, including actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2030, on long-term care insurance policies; and interest rates. Assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.\n\nClaim reserves . Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. Key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. Claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.\n\nReinsurance recoverables . We cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies, and record receivables for estimated recoveries as we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholders or cedents. These receivables are estimated in a manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves. Reserves ceded to reinsurers, net of allowance, were $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in the caption All other assets in our Statement of Financial Position.\n\nPremium Deficiency Testing . We annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. The premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. A comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. Premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nThe primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include:\n\nMorbidity . Morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. For long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last). Prior to 2017, premium deficiency assumptions considered the risk of anti-selection by including issue age adjustments to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long-term care policies issued to younger individuals would exhibit lower expected incidences and claim costs than those issued to older policyholders. Recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curves indicated issue age differences had minimal impact on claim cost projections, and, accordingly, beginning in 2017, issue age adjustments were eliminated in developing morbidity assumptions. Higher morbidity increases, while lower morbidity decreases, the present value of expected future benefit payments.",

Given that Class B shares typically carry significantly more voting power per share (e.g., 15 votes per share as seen in the Comcast example), this shift likely reinforced the relative voting control held by Class B shareholders.

      "answer": "In 2022, MMM reported that foreign exchange forward and option contracts were used to hedge forecasted transactions, with the maximum hedge period extending up to 36 months. By 2024, the notional amount of foreign exchange cash flow hedges had increased to $9.9 billion from $8.3 billion in the prior year, and MMM recorded $99 million in net deferred gains in AOCI for contracts maturing in the next twelve months. This indicates that the increased use of foreign exchange option contracts in 2024 led to a larger deferral of gains in AOCI compared to 2022, where the focus was on the structure and policy of hedging without specific AOCI deferral figures, but with similar hedge durations.",

Real estate consists of property funds and REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts). REITS are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which it is traded.\n\nAbsolute return consists of private partnership interests in hedge funds, insurance contracts, derivative instruments, hedge fund of funds, and other alternative investments. Insurance consists of insurance contracts, which are valued using cash surrender values which is the amount the plan would receive if the contract was cashed out at year end. Derivative instruments consist of various swaps and bond futures that are used to help manage risks.\n\nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include the net of interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased and interest payable.\n\nThe balances of and changes in the fair values of the international pension plans' level 3 assets consist primarily of insurance contracts under the absolute return asset class. In 2021 the aggregate of net purchases and net unrealized gains and losses decreased this balance by $7 million and the change in currency exchange rates decreased this balance by $44 million for a net decrease of $51 million. In 2020 the aggregate net purchases and net unrealized gains decreased this balance by $1 million and the change in currency exchange rates increased the balance by $44 million for a net increase to this balance of $43 million.\n\n## NOTE 14. Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3M's financial position and performance.\n\nAdditional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:\n\n- Impact on other comprehensive income of nonderivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 8.\n- Fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 15.\n- Derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company's long-term debt are also described in Note 12.\n\nRefer to the section below titled Statement of Income Location and Impact of Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments for details on the location within the consolidated statements of income for amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow or fair value hedges (along with similar information relative to the hedged items) and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Additional information relative to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included below as applicable.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges:\n\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts: The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income for de-designated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in the value of derivative instruments after de-designation are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments section below. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months.",

The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million. The following table summarizes the effect of foreign ex change cash flow hedges on AOCI:\n\n",

Supplier Finance Program Obligations\n\nUnder supplier finance programs, 3M agrees to pay participating banks the stated amount of confirmed invoices from its designated suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices, generally within 90 days of the invoice date. 3M or the banks may terminate the agreements with advance notice. Separately, the banks may have arrangements with the suppliers that provide them the option to request early payment from the banks for invoices confirmed by 3M. 3M's outstanding balances of confirmed invoices in the programs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. These amounts are included within accounts payable on 3M's consolidated balance sheet. The activity in 2024 included approximately $1.5 billion of invoices confirmed and $1.5 billion of invoices paid and other adjustments.\n\n## NOTE 17. Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3M's financial position and performance.\n\nAdditional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:\n\n- Impact on other comprehensive income of non-derivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 9.\n- Fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 18.\n- Derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company's long-term debt are also described in Note 14.\n\nRefer to the section below titled Location on Statement of Income (Loss) and Impact of Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments for details on the location within the consolidated statements of income (loss) for amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow or fair value hedges (along with similar information relative to the hedged items) and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Additional information relative to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included below as applicable.\n\nCash Flow Hedges: For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts: The Company may enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of ex change rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The Company may de-designate a cash flow hedge if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable, if 3M determines that the hedge is no longer expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction, or in certain other circumstances. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income for de-designated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in the value of derivative instruments after de-designation are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments section below. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Interest Rate Contracts: The Company may use forward starting interest rate contracts and treasury rate lock contracts to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments on forecasted debt issuances.\n\nThe amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the gain/(loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had a balance of $15 million associated with the after-tax net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). This includes a remaining balance of $80 million (after-tax loss) related to forward starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock contracts terminated in 2019 concurrent with associated debt issuances, which is being amortized over the respective lives of the underlying notes. Based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, of the total after-tax net unrealized balance as of December 31, 2024, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $44 million after-tax  net unrealized gain over the nex t 12 months (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).",

      "answer": "In 2023, GD reported $8 million in real estate funds measured using NAV as a practical expedient for its pension assets, while in 2024, this category was excluded from the fair value hierarchy but remained included in the reconciliation to total plan assets. The 2024 disclosure indicates that NAV was used for Level 2 commingled funds based on observable inputs from the fund's underlying investments, suggesting a shift in how NAV was applied within the valuation framework. This reflects a refinement in GD's pension asset valuation approach, aligning NAV usage more closely with observable market data rather than solely as an expedient measure.",

By 2024, UPS explicitly stated that it used valuation models to assess sensitivity to foreign exchange, interest rate, and equity price risks embedded in financial instruments, indicating a more formalized and quantitative approach to managing market risk exposure in these investments. This evolution suggests a shift from purely NAV-based reporting to a more dynamic risk modeling framework.",

We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with ex posure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in ex change rates, interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non-linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts.\n\nThere are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that foreign currency ex change rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex  market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fix ed and floating interest rate mix  of our interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions. Additionally, changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, Caterpillar valued its insurance contracts in the non-U.S. pension assets at $675 million. By 2024, this valuation dropped to $601 million, reflecting a decline of $74 million. This change aligns with the valuation methodology, which updates insurance contracts based on shifts in insurance market pricing, market rates, and inflation. During the same period, investments in non-U.S. corporate bonds increased from $466 million in 2023 to $468 million in 2024, while global fixed income rose from $91 million to $104 million. These trends suggest a potential reallocation of pension assets from insurance contracts toward fixed income categories, particularly non-U.S. corporate bonds, likely in response to evolving market pricing dynamics.",

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS's Class B shares had one vote per share and were publicly traded, while Class A shares, which were primarily held by employees, retirees, and founder-related trusts, had 10 votes per share and were fully convertible into Class B shares. By 2024, the structure remained consistent in terms of voting rights and convertibility, with no changes to the number of authorized shares (4.6 billion Class A and 5.6 billion Class B). This indicates that UPS maintained a dual-class share structure with no structural changes to the relationship between Class B and Class A shares over this period, preserving the concentrated voting power among long-term stakeholders.",

By 2023, the company increased its exposure to real estate through a shift toward limited partnerships, with $5 million in future commitments to real estate partnerships. This change aligns with a broader strategy where the plan began investing in structures like limited partnerships, which came with unfunded commitments totaling $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2023. The shift reflects a move from more traditional real estate fund investments to vehicles that offer potentially higher returns but with longer lock-up periods and limited redemption provisions.",

      "answer": "In 2023, UNP's coal shipments declined due to mild winter weather and low natural gas prices, contributing to a 1% volume decrease in bulk freight and negatively impacting freight revenues. This trend intensified in 2024, where coal shipment volumes fell by 4% year-over-year, again influenced by mild winter weather and low natural gas prices, which further reduced electricity generation demand. As a result, bulk freight revenues continued to decline in 2024, despite some offsetting factors like increased fertilizer and export grain shipments. The mild winter weather's impact on coal demand persisted and deepened, contributing to a more pronounced decline in bulk freight revenues in 2024 compared to 2023.",

Volumes declined 4% compared to 2023 driv en by reduced use of coal in electricity generationbecause of low natural gas prices, coal fired plant capacity, and mild winter weather, partially offset by strength in export grain to Mexico and several other grain products. Additionally, the v olume declines were partially offset by increased fertilizer shipments due to strong demand and a 2023 customer outage. Volumes for  coal  and  renewables  and  food  and  refrigerated  shipments  were  negativ ely  impacted  by outages  and  serv ice  challenges  due  to  repeated  snow  ev ents  in  Wyoming  and  flooding  in California in the first quarter of 2023 positiv ely impacting the year-ov er-year comparisons.\n\nIndustrial -  Industrial  includes  shipments  of  industrial  chemicals  and  plastics,  metals  and minerals, forest products, and energy and specialized markets.

      "answer": "In 2022, General Dynamics highlighted that schedule requirements were a key factor in the assumptions and projections used for contract accounting, directly influencing estimates around labor productivity, material availability, and work complexity. By 2024, the company noted that increased volatility in schedule requirements\u2014particularly due to supply chain disruptions and delays in semiconductor procurement\u2014led to more conservative projections in contract accounting. This shift was necessary to account for greater uncertainty in meeting delivery timelines, which in turn affected revenue recognition patterns and margin estimates. The evolution of these schedule pressures is reflected in the growing emphasis on supplier performance risks in the 2024 filings, indicating a recalibration of assumptions to reflect operational realities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GD(2022) \u2192 Schedule Requirements: The 2022 filings explicitly list schedule requirements as a key factor in contract accounting assumptions, alongside labor, materials, and work complexity.",
        "Hop 2: Schedule Requirements \u2192 Assumptions and Projections: Both filings establish that schedule requirements directly influence the projections used in contract accounting under U.S. government auditing standards.",
        "Hop 3: Assumptions and Projections \u2190 GD(2024): The 2024 filings show a more cautious tone around schedule risks, citing supply chain disruptions and semiconductor shortages as forcing a reevaluation of assumptions used in financial projections."

The government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor. If a contract is terminated  for  default,  the  government  in  most  cases  pays  only  for  the  work  it  has  accepted.  Many  foreign contracts  have  similar  termination  rights  by  customers. The  termination  of  multiple  or  large  programs  could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings.\n\nGovernment contractors operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to audit by the U.S.  government. Numerous  U.S.  government  agencies  routinely  audit  and  review  government  contractors. These  agencies  review  a  contractor's  performance  under  its  contracts  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws, regulations and standards. The U.S. government also reviews the adequacy of, and compliance with, internal control systems and policies, including the contractor's purchasing, property, estimating, material, earned value management and accounting systems. In some cases, audits may result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment. If an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities, civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result, including  termination  of  contracts,  forfeiture  of  profits,  suspension  of  payments,  fines  and  suspension  or prohibition  from  doing  business  with  the  U.S.  government.  In  addition,  reputational  harm  could  result  if allegations  of  impropriety  were  made.  In  some  cases,  audits  may  result  in  disputes  with  the  respective government  agency  that  can  result  in  negotiated  settlements,  arbitration  or  litigation.  Moreover,  new  laws, regulations or standards, or changes to existing ones, can increase our performance and compliance costs and reduce our profitability.\n\nOur Aerospace segment is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft. The business jet market  is  driven  by  the  demand  for  business-aviation  products  and  services  by  corporate,  individual  and government customers in the United States and around the world. The Aerospace segment's results also depend on other factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit, pricing pressures and trends in  capital  goods  markets.  In  addition,  if  customers  default  on  existing  contracts  and  the  contracts  are  not replaced, the segment's anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially.\n\nEarnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contracts. When agreeing to contractual terms,  our  management  team  makes  assumptions  and  projections  about  future  conditions  and  events.  The accounting  for  our  contracts  and  programs  requires  assumptions  and  estimates  about  these  conditions  and events. These projections and estimates assess:\n\n- the productivity and availability of labor;\n- the complexity of the work to be performed;\n- the cost and availability of materials and components; and\n- schedule requirements.\n\nIf  there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances, estimates or assumptions, or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately, the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected. This could affect earnings and margin materially.\n\nEarnings and margin depend in part on subcontractor and supplier performance.

      "answer": "GE maintained ERAC in its 2024 run-off insurance operations, even though ERAC stopped accepting new policies after 2008. In 2022, GE disclosed that ERAC accounted for more than two-thirds of its total long-term care insurance reserves, which were valued at $21.7 billion, and highlighted that ERAC's portfolio had a lower average attained age and more policies with lifetime benefit periods and inflation protection\u2014features that could lead to higher future claims. By 2024, while the total long-term care reserves remained substantial, GE continued to emphasize the complexity and long-duration nature of these reinsurance arrangements, noting that ERAC still posed significant premium deficiency risks tied to mortality trends and investment performance. Despite no new policies being accepted since 2008, ERAC remained a core part of the portfolio, suggesting that GE's risk management strategies\u2014such as premium rate adjustments, reinsurance transactions, and asset-liability matching\u2014were focused on mitigating legacy liabilities rather than growth. This continuity indicates that the cessation of new policies had shifted ERAC's role from a growth vehicle to a risk containment focus, with GE managing a shrinking but high-risk book.",

          "chunk_text": "## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. The run-off insurance operations of North American Life and Health (NALH) primarily include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumes long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumes long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc.(Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004. The vast majority of NALH's reinsurance exposures are long-duration arrangements that still involve substantial levels of premium collections and benefit payments even though ERAC and UFLIC have not entered into new reinsurance treaties in more than a decade. These long-duration arrangements involve a number of direct writers and contain a range of risk transfer provisions and other contractual elements. In many instances, these arrangements do not transfer to us 100 percent of the risk embodied in the encompassed underlying policies issued by the direct writers. Furthermore, we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies.\n\nOur run-off insurance liabilities and annuity benefits primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for those insurance contract claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported. The insurance liabilities and annuity benefits amounted to $37.2 billion and $42.2 billion and primarily relate to individual long- term care insurance reserves of $21.7 billion and $21.3 billion and structured settlement annuities and life insurance reserves of $10.3 billion and $10.7 billion, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in insurance liabilities and annuity benefits of $5.0 billion from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to an adjustment of $4.8 billion resulting from the higher margin from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities that would result in a premium deficiency should those gains be realized.\n\nIn addition to NALH, Electric Insurance Company (EIC) is a property and casualty insurance company primarily providing insurance to GE and its employees with net claim reserves of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We believe recent elevated mortality across our portfolio and lower long-term care insurance claims are short term in nature and attributable to COVID-19. However, the effects of COVID-19, including the continued emergence of variants and success of vaccinations, remain uncertain and may result in variability in levels of future mortality and long-term care insurance claims activity, including changes in policyholder behavior (e.g., policyholder willingness to enter long-term care facilities or seek care at home), among others. These monitoring activities also allow us to evaluate opportunities to reduce our insurance risk profile and improve the results of our run-off insurance operations. Such opportunities may include the pursuit of future premium rate increases and benefit reductions on long-term care insurance contracts in accordance with our reinsurance contracts with our ceding companies; recapture and reinsurance transactions to reduce risk where economically justified; investment strategies to improve asset and liability matching and enhance investment portfolio yields; and managing our expense levels.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. For example, policyholders with a lifetime benefit period could receive coverage up to the specified daily maximum as long as the policyholder is claim eligible and receives care for covered services; inflation protection options increase the daily maximums to protect the policyholder from the rising cost of care with some options providing automatic annual increases of 3% to 5% or policyholder elected inflation-indexed increases for increased premium; joint life policies provide coverage for two lives which permit either life under a single contract to receive benefits at the same time or separately; and premium payment options may limit the period over which the policyholder pays premiums while still receiving coverage after premium payments cease, which may limit the impact of our benefit from future premium rate increases.\n\nThe ERAC long-term care insurance portfolio comprises more than two-thirds of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is assumed from approximately 30 ceding companies through various types of reinsurance and retrocession contracts having complex terms and conditions. Compared to the overall long-term care insurance block, it has a lower average attained age and more policies (and covered lives, as over one-third of the policies are joint life policies) with lifetime benefit periods and/or with inflation protection options which may result in a higher potential for future claims.\n\nThe UFLIC long-term care insurance block comprises the remainder of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is more mature with policies that are more uniform, as it is assumed from a single ceding company, Genworth, and has fewer policies with lifetime benefit periods, no joint life policies and slightly more policies with inflation protection options.\n\nPresented in the table below are GAAP and statutory reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

Refer to the Other Items - Insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimates and assumptions in our insurance reserves and their sensitivity to change. See Notes 1 and 12 for further information.\n\nPENSION ASSUMPTIONS. Refer to Note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nINCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017, substantially all of our unrepatriated net earnings have been subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without significant additional tax cost. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. M ost of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which rely on reasonable estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. A mounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of this, an insignificant amount and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our GE V ernova, GE HealthCare and legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information - Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and 15 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental, health and safety matters, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, government contracts, employee benefit plans, product quality guarantees and losses resulting from other events and developments. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace products is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these products may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. M oreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\n## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE.

      "answer": "In 2023, LMT faced significant risks from cost overruns tied to fixed-price contracts, as highlighted in their 10-K filing, which noted that these contracts could negatively affect expected profit and cash flows if cost assumptions were unrealistic or if external pressures such as supply chain disruptions and inflation impacted performance. In 2024, LMT continued to operate under fixed-price contracts, as stated in their 10-K, which described how these contracts expose the company to cost variability, with profit or loss determined by the extent to which actual costs align with estimates. Since fixed-price contracts inherently shift financial risk to the contractor and LMT maintained this contract structure year-over-year, the profitability outlook remained sensitive to unforeseen cost increases, particularly in a high-inflation environment. This continuity in contract type suggests that LMT's risk profile related to cost overruns likely persisted at a minimum, if not increased due to macroeconomic pressures.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Lockheed Martin Corporation\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\n\nOrganization -  We  are  a  global  aerospace  and  defense  company  principally  engaged  in  the  research,  design,  development,  manufacture,  integration  and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. G overnment. As described in 'Note 3 - Information on Business Segments', we operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space.\n\nBasis of presentation -  These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries we control and variable interest entities if we are the primary beneficiary. We eliminate intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. We classify certain assets and liabilities as current utilizing the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. This primarily impacts receivables, contract assets, inventories, and contract liabilities. We classify all other assets and liabilities based on whether the asset will be realized or the liability will be paid within one year. Additionally, certain  prior  year  amounts  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows  have  been  reclassified  within  operating  activities  to  conform  to  the  current  year's presentation. These reclassifications were not material and had no impact on total net cash provided by operating activities as previously reported.\n\nOn October 30, 2024, we closed our acquisition of Terran Orbital Corporation (Terran Orbital) for a purchase consideration of $314 million. We accounted for this acquisition as a 'step acquisition' (as defined in U.S. GAAP) and accordingly, $83 million of our previously held investments in Terran Orbital were included as part of the purchase consideration. The remaining purchase price of $231 million was paid with cash on hand (net of cash acquired). Terran Orbital became a whollyowned subsidiary and operates within our Space business segment. The purchase consideration of $314 million was allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. As a result, we recorded goodwill of $298 million at our Space business segment. The final determination of the fair values of certain assets and liabilities will be completed within the measurement period of up to one year from the respective acquisition date. The financial results of Terran Orbital have been included within our operating results in the period post-acquisition.\n\nUse of estimates - We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In doing so, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, accounting for sales and cost recognition; postretirement benefit plans; environmental liabilities and assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery; evaluation of  goodwill,  intangible  assets,  investments  and  other  assets  for  impairment;  income  tax es  including  deferred  income  tax es;  fair  value  measurements;  and contingencies.\n\nRevenue Recognition -The majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. G overnment and international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. G overnment) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing requirements, primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fix ed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixedfee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an",

      "question": "How did Caterpillar's use of commercial paper financing change between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about their short-term liquidity strategy?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar's commercial paper financing decreased from $4,069 million in 2023 to $3,946 million in 2024, indicating a slight reduction in their reliance on this form of short-term financing. This change was part of a broader trend where total short-term borrowings also decreased from $4,643 million in 2023 to $4,393 million in 2024. The reduction in commercial paper suggests Caterpillar may have adjusted its liquidity strategy to maintain a more conservative financial position or had reduced short-term funding needs in 2024 compared to 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GD reported $13 million in real estate funds as part of its pension plan assets, categorized under Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to the use of unobservable inputs in valuation models. These funds were valued using NAV as a practical expedient, with typical redemption terms between 8 and 10 years. By 2024, GD continued using NAV for valuation but provided more detailed disclosures about the fair value hierarchy. While real estate funds remained in Level 3, GD clarified that these assets were now explicitly excluded from the formal fair value hierarchy presentation, though still included in total plan asset reconciliations. The 2024 filing also emphasized that most NAV-based investments, including real estate funds, were redeemable at NAV with notice periods generally up to 90 days, showing increased transparency around liquidity terms compared to 2023.",

Our plan assets invested in Level 2 com m ingled funds are valued using a unit price or NA V obtained from the fund's transfer agent or investm ent m anager that is based on the underlying, observable investm ents of the fund. Our Level 3 assets consist of i n su ran ce deposi t contracts, reti rem ent annui ty contracts and real estate funds.\n\nCertain investm ents valued using NA V as a practical expedient are excluded from  the fair value hierarchy but are included in the tables below to permit  reconciliation  to  total  pl an  assets.

      "question": "How did LMT's growing reliance on fixed-price contracts in 2023 impact their exposure to cost overruns and consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments compared to 2022?",
      "answer": "In 2022, LMT was already subject to cost overruns due to supplier delays and fixed-price contracts that constrained their ability to recover increased costs. By 2023, this exposure intensified as seen in specific programs like the classified fixed-price incentive fee contract and the ground-based radar program, which each accumulated approximately $270 million and $280 million in cumulative losses, respectively. RTX's 2023 evidence further explains that fixed-price contracts are particularly vulnerable to cost overruns driven by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and labor cost increases\u2014factors LMT faced directly. This led to a decline in LMT's consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments, which increased net sales by $1.6 billion in 2023 compared to $2.0 billion in 2022, reflecting the growing financial strain from fixed-price contract risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LMT(2022) \u2192 Cost Overruns: LMT faced cost overruns due to supplier delays and fixed-price contracts that limited cost recovery.",
        "Hop 2: Cost Overruns \u2192 Fixed-Price Contracts: RTX's 2023 evidence shows that fixed-price contracts are especially prone to cost overruns due to macroeconomic pressures like inflation and supply chain issues.",
        "Hop 3: Fixed-Price Contracts \u2190 LMT(2023): LMT\u2019s 2023 results show significant losses on fixed-price contracts, including two major programs with over $270 million in cumulative losses each, and a drop in net profit booking rate adjustments from $2.0 billion (2022) to $1.6 billion (2023)."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur planned production rates and deliveries have been affected and could continue to be affected by COVID-19 or supplier delays which affect our results of operations. We also may not be successful in making hardware and software upgrades and other modernization capabilities in a timely manner, including as a result of dependencies on suppliers, which could increase costs and create  schedule  delays.  Our  ability  to  capture  and  retain  future  F-35  growth  in  development,  production  and  sustainment  is dependent  on  the  success  of  our  efforts  to  achieve  F-35  sustainment  performance,  customer  affordability,  supply  chain improvements, continued reliability improvements and other efficiencies, some of which are outside our control.\n\n## We are subject to procurement laws and regulations, including those that enable the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience. Our business and reputation could be adversely affected if we or those we do business with fail to comply with these laws.\n\nWe  must  comply  with  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  the  award,  administration  and  performance  of  U.S.  Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and impose certain risks and costs on our business. A violation of these laws and regulations by us, our employees, others working on our behalf, a supplier or a joint venture partner could harm our reputation and result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, suspension or debarment from bidding on or being awarded contracts, loss of our ability to export products or perform services and civil  or  criminal  investigations  or  proceedings.  In  addition,  costs  to  comply  with  new  government  regulations  can  increase  our costs, reduce our margins and affect our competitiveness.\n\nGovernment contract laws and regulations  can  impose  terms  or  obligations  that  are  different  than  those  typically  found  in commercial transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts not only for  default  based  on  our  performance  but  also  at  its  convenience.  Upon  termination  for  convenience  of  a  fixed-price  type contract, typically we are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-inprocess and an allowance for profit on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost-reimbursable contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee, and allowable costs include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. Programs occasionally do not have sufficient funds appropriated to cover the termination costs if the government were to terminate them for convenience. Under such circumstances, the U.S. Government could assert that it is not required to appropriate additional funding.\n\nA termination arising out of our default may expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for  future  contracts  and  orders.  In  addition,  the  U.S.  Government  could  terminate  a  prime  contract  under  which  we  are  a subcontractor,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  our  performance  and  the  quality  of  the  products  or  services  we  delivered  were consistent with our contractual obligations as a subcontractor. In the case of termination for default, the U.S. Government could make claims to reduce the contract value or recover its procurement costs and could assess other special penalties.\n\nOur programs for the U.S. Government often operate for periods of time under Undefinitized Contract Actions (UCAs), which means that we begin performing our obligations before the terms, specifications or price are finally agreed to between the parties. The U.S. Government has (and has exercised in the past) the ability to unilaterally definitize contracts, which, absent a successful appeal,  obligates  us  to  perform  under  terms  and  conditions  imposed  by  the  U.S.  Government.  This  can  affect  our  ability  to negotiate mutually agreeable contract terms and, if a contract is unilaterally imposed upon us, it may negatively affect our expected profit and cash flows on a program or impose burdensome terms.\n\nCertain  of  our  U.S.  Government  contracts  span  one  or  more  base  years  and  include  multiple  option  years.  The  U.S. Government  may  decide  not  to  exercise  option  periods,  which  could  result  in  a  loss  of  expected  sales  or  profits.  The  U.S. Government also may decide to exercise option periods for contracts under which it is expected that our costs may exceed the contract price or ceiling, which could result in losses or unreimbursed costs.\n\n## Evolving U.S. Government procurement policies, increased emphasis on cost over performance and rapid acquisition initiatives could adversely affect our business.\n\nThe U.S. Government could implement procurement policies that negatively impact our profitability or the ability to win new business.  Changes  in  procurement  policy  favoring  more  incentive-based  fee  arrangements,  different  award  fee  criteria  or government contract negotiation offers based upon the customer's view of what our costs should be (as compared to our actual costs) may affect the predictability of our profit rates or make it more difficult to compete on certain types of programs. In addition, changes in contract financing policy for  fixed-price  contracts,  such  as  changes  in  performance  and  progress  payments  policies, including a reversal or modification of the DoD's March 2020 increase to the applicable progress payment rate from 80% to 90%, could significantly affect the timing of our cash flows. Our customers also may seek to negotiate non-traditional contract provisions or  contract  types.  The  U.S.  Government's  preference  for  fixed-price  contracting  has  resulted  in  what  we  believe  to  be  the inappropriate application of fixed-priced contracting methods to development programs.

      "question": "How did the implementation of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) cost accounting standards in 2022 influence Lockheed Martin's revenue recognition methodology for U.S. Government Contracts in 2023, particularly in relation to performance obligations and variable consideration?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin applied FAR cost accounting standards which governed how revenue was recognized for U.S. Government Contracts, particularly requiring that standalone selling prices for products or services were typically equal to the contractually stated price due to the cost-plus-reasonable-profit framework. By 2023, this regulatory influence persisted, with Lockheed Martin continuing to treat most contracts as a single performance obligation due to the complex interrelationships between deliverables. However, the company refined its approach to variable consideration, such as incentive fees and claims, by estimating these at the most likely amount only when it was probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur. This evolution indicates a more cautious and risk-adjusted revenue recognition strategy under the continued constraints of FAR, especially regarding contracts with performance-based incentives.",

        "Hop 1: LMT(2022) \u2192 FAR: In 2022, LMT followed FAR guidelines which dictated that standalone selling prices for U.S. Government contracts were equal to the stated contract price based on costs plus a reasonable profit margin.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nincentive based on performance). Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts provide a fixed fee that is negotiated at the inception of the contract and does not vary with actual costs.\n\nWe assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If  combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.\n\nWe evaluate  the  products  or  services  promised  in  each  contract  at  inception  to  determine  whether  the  contract  should  be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have  more  than  one  distinct  performance  obligation,  which  occurs  when  we  perform  activities  that  are  not  highly  complex  or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.\n\nWe determine the transaction  price  for  each  contract  based  on  the  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  for  the  products  or services being provided under the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary, we estimate variable consideration at  the  most  likely  amount,  which  is  included  in  the  transaction  price  to  the  extent  it  is  probable  that  a  significant  reversal  of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.\n\nAt the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently  modified  to  include  changes  in  specifications,  requirements  or  price,  which  may  create  new  or  change  existing enforceable  rights  and  obligations.  Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  modification,  we  consider  whether  to  account  for  the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. Therefore,  such  modifications  are  accounted  for  as  if  they  were  part  of  the  existing  contract  and  recognized  as  a  cumulative adjustment to revenue.\n\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other  products  or  services).  Our  contracts  with  the  U.S.  Government,  including  FMS  contracts,  are  subject  to  the  Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.\n\nFor non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer's specifications.  When  it  is  necessary  to  allocate  the  transaction  price  to  multiple  performance  obligations,  we  typically  use  the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.\n\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For most contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience  and  pay  us  for  costs  incurred  plus  a  reasonable  profit.  For  most  non-U.S.  Government  contracts,  primarily international direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that  do  not  have  an  alternative  use  to  us  and  if  our  customer  were  to  terminate  the  contract  for  reasons  other  than  our  nonperformance  we  would  have  the  right  to  recover  damages  which  would  include,  among  other  potential  damages,  the  right  to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.",

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

Class B shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbol \"UPS\". Class A and B shares both have a $0.01 par value, and as of December 31, 2021, there were 4.6 billion class A shares and 5.6 billion class B shares authorized to be issued. Additionally, there are 200 million preferred shares authorized to be issued, with a par value of $0.01 per share.

      "question": "How did UPS's equity compensation strategy evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly regarding the use of Class B Common Stock under the LTIP, and what does the slight increase in issued Class B shares from 726 million in 2023 to 733 million in 2024 suggest about potential constraints or strategic decisions related to long-term incentive awards?",
      "answer": "In 2023, UPS disclosed that while the LTIP permitted the issuance of Class B Common Stock, no shares had been authorized for issuance under that program. Most equity awards were funded with Class A stock instead. The total fair value of Restricted Performance Units (RPUs) under other programs was $1.1 billion in 2023, and all MIP RPUs fully vested during the year. By 2024, the number of issued Class B shares increased slightly from 726 million to 733 million, indicating minimal but deliberate use of this class. This small increase suggests that while UPS may be exploring or maintaining flexibility in its equity compensation structure, the lack of formal authorization for Class B shares under the LTIP likely constrained broader adoption of Class B stock in long-term incentive awards. The conservative change implies strategic caution or ongoing evaluation of equity structure in compensation planning.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS(2023) \u2192 LTIP: Discloses details of equity compensation, including the vesting and fair value of RPUs, and notes that Class B shares are permitted under the LTIP but not authorized.",
        "Hop 2: LTIP \u2192 Class B Common Stock: The LTIP authorizes but does not authorize the issuance of Class B Common Stock, indicating a policy framework that allows but does not actively utilize this class for long-term incentives.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 UPS(2024): Discloses a slight increase in issued Class B shares from 726 million in 2023 to 733 million in 2024, suggesting limited but intentional use of this class in UPS's capital structure."

      "question": "How did the shift in UPS's reliance on the U.S. Postal Service for final-mile delivery through UPS SurePost in 2022 compare with its competitive positioning against the USPS in 2024, and what does this suggest about UPS's evolving domestic delivery strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UPS utilized the U.S. Postal Service as a key component of its final-mile delivery for lightweight residential packages via UPS SurePost, leveraging USPS's extensive network to handle non-urgent shipments efficiently. By 2024, the relationship had evolved, with UPS explicitly identifying the U.S. Postal Service as a competitor in its 10-K filing, signaling a strategic shift toward direct competition in the domestic delivery space. This evolution suggests that UPS is moving away from outsourcing certain delivery segments to USPS and is instead investing in its own infrastructure to maintain market share and profitability in a rapidly changing logistics environment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS(2022) \u2192 UPS SurePost: UPS offered the SurePost service for lightweight residential shipments, with final delivery often handled by the U.S. Postal Service.",
        "Hop 2: UPS SurePost \u2192 U.S. Postal Service: The U.S. Postal Service was used by UPS as a final-mile delivery partner for non-urgent residential packages through the SurePost service.",
        "Hop 3: U.S. Postal Service \u2190 UPS(2024): UPS now identifies the U.S. Postal Service as a direct competitor in its 2024 risk factors, signaling a shift in relationship from collaboration to competition."

Our global network offers approximately 188,000 entry points where customers can tender packages to us at locations and times convenient to them. This includes UPS drivers who can accept packages, UPS drop boxes, UPS Access Point locations, The UPS Store locations, authorized shipping outlets and commercial counters, alliance locations and customer centers attached to UPS facilities. Our UPS Access Point network includes local small businesses and national retailers. This network allows consumers to ship or redirect packages to an alternate delivery location or to drop off pre-labeled packages, including returns. The UPS Access Point network includes more than 20,000 locations within the U.S. and 52,000 globally.\n\nWe offer a portfolio of returns services in more than 140 countries. These services are driven by the continued growth of ecommerce that has increased our customers' need for efficient and reliable returns, and are designed to promote efficiency and a friction-free consumer experience. This portfolio provides a range of cost-effective label and digital returns options and a broad network of consumer drop points. We also offer a selection of returns technologies, such as UPS Returns Manager, that promote systems integration, increase customer ease of use and visibility of inbound merchandise. These technologies help reduce costs and improve efficiency in our customers' reverse logistics processes.\n\nOur global air operations are based in Louisville, Kentucky, and are supported by air hubs across the United States and internationally. We operate international air hubs in Germany, China, Hong Kong, Canada and Florida (for Latin America and the Caribbean). This network design enables cost-effective package processing in our most technology-enabled facilities, which allows us to use fewer, larger and more fuel-efficient aircraft.\n\n## U.S. Domestic Package\n\nWe are a leader in time-definite, guaranteed small package delivery services in the United States. We offer a full spectrum of U.S. domestic guaranteed air and ground package transportation services. Our U.S. ground fleet serves all business and residential zip codes in the contiguous United States.\n\n- Our air portfolio offers time-definite, same day, next day, two day and three day delivery alternatives.\n- Our ground network enables customers to ship using our day-definite guaranteed ground service. We deliver more ground packages in the U.S. than any other carrier, with average daily package volume of more than 17 million, most within one to three business days.\n- UPS SurePost provides residential ground service for customers with non-urgent, lightweight residential shipments. It offers the consistency and reliability of the UPS ground network, with final delivery often provided by the U.S. Postal Service.\n\n## International Package\n\nInternational Package consists of our small package operations in Europe, Asia Pacific, Canada, Latin America and ISMEA. International high-growth markets are one of our identified growth opportunities. We offer a wide selection of guaranteed day- and time-definite international shipping services, including more guaranteed time-definite express options than any other carrier.\n\nFor international package shipments that do not require express services, UPS Worldwide Expedited offers a reliable, deferred, guaranteed day-definite service option. For cross-border ground package delivery, we offer UPS Standard delivery services within Europe, between the U.S. and Canada, and between the U.S. and Mexico. UPS Worldwide Express Freight is a premium international service for urgent, palletized shipments over 150 pounds.\n\nEurope is our largest region outside of the U.S. and, in 2021, accounted for nearly half of our international package segment revenue. We continue to make major European infrastructure investments to meet growing demand for our services and to improve transit times across the region. Customers can reach more than 80% of Europe's population within two business days using UPS Standard.\n\nWe serve more than 40 Asia Pacific countries and territories through more than two dozen alliances with local delivery companies that supplement our owned operations.\n\nThe introduction of a direct flight from the U.S. to Dubai has improved time-in-transit to key destinations in ISMEA for shippers throughout the U.S., Canada and Latin America. In India, we are investing in our network to improve transit times and extend pickup times, allowing businesses to gain faster access to markets in Europe and the United States.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are and will remain subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, which may have materially affected or could materially affect us, including impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price, credit rating or reputation. Y ou should read these risk factors in conjunction with \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7 and our \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in Item 8. These are not the only risks we face. We could also be affected by other unknown events, factors, uncertainties, or risks that we do not currently consider to be material.\n\n## Business and Operating Risks\n\n## Changes in general economic conditions, in the U.S. and internationally, may adversely affect us.\n\nWe conduct operations in over 200 countries and territories. Our operations are subject to national and international economic factors, as well as the local economic environments in which we operate. Changes in general economic conditions are beyond our control, and it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model. For example, we are affected by industrial production, inflation, unemployment, consumer spending and retail activity levels. We have been, and may in the future be, materially affected by adverse developments in these aspects of the economy. We have also been, and may in the future be, adversely impacted by changes in general economic conditions resulting from geopolitical uncertainty and/or conflicts in or arising from the countries and regions where we operate, including the European Union, Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the Middle East and the Trans-Pacific region. Changes in general economic conditions, or our inability to accurately forecast these changes or mitigate the impact of these conditions on our business, could materially adversely affect us.\n\n## Our industry is rapidly evolving. We expect to continue to face significant competition, which could materially adversely affect us.\n\nOur industry continues to rapidly evolve, including demands for faster deliveries, increased visibility into shipments and development of other services. We expect to continue to face significant local, regional, national and international competition. Competitors include the U.S. and international postal services, various motor carriers, ex press companies, freight forwarders, air couriers, large transportation companies, e-commerce companies and other retailers that continue to make significant investments in their own technology and logistics capabilities, some of whom are currently our customers. We also face competition from start-ups and other smaller companies that combine technologies with flexible labor solutions such as crowdsourcing. New and emerging technologies are also creating additional sources of competition. Competitors have cost, operational and organizational structures that differ from ours and may offer services or pricing terms that we are not willing to offer. Additionally, from time to time we have raised, and may in the future raise, prices and our customers may not be willing to accept these higher prices. If we do not appropriately respond to competitive pressures, including retaining or replacing volume lost to competitors or maintaining our profitability, we could be materially adversely affected.\n\nIndustry growth, or lack thereof, may further increase competition. As a result, opportunities for growth could be limited or competitors may improve their financial capacity and strengthen their competitive positions. Business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices, which could also materially adversely affect us.\n\n## Changes in our relationships with any of our significant customers, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, one customer, Amazon.com, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for 11.8% of our consolidated revenues. In the first quarter of 2025, we entered into an agreement in principle with this customer that will provide for a reduction in their volume by more than 50% by June 2026. In connection therewith, we are making certain business and operational changes intended to match our workforce to our activity and eliminate our stranded costs. In the event we are not able to successfully reduce our costs in connection therewith, our profitability could be materially impacted. For additional information on the ex pected operational and financial impacts arising from this agreement, see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations'.\n\nSome of our other larger customers can account for a relatively significant portion of our volume and revenues in a particular quarter or year. Customer impact on our revenue and profitability can vary based on a number of factors, including: contractual volume amounts; pricing terms; product launches; e-commerce or other industry trends, including those related to the holiday season; business combinations and the overall growth of a customer's underlying business; as well as any disruptions to their businesses. Customers could choose, and have in the past chosen, to divert all or a portion of their business",

      "question": "How did the introduction of AspenTech's stock-based compensation plans after Emerson's 2022 acquisition impact the total performance share expense reported by Emerson in 2023 compared to 2022?",
      "answer": "Emerson's acquisition of AspenTech in 2022 led to the integration of AspenTech's stock-based compensation plans, which included performance shares. This integration contributed to a significant increase in Emerson's total performance share expense, rising from $89 million in 2022 to $165 million in 2023. The introduction of AspenTech's compensation plans amplified Emerson\u2019s overall stock compensation expense, particularly from continuing operations, which doubled from $125 million in 2022 to $250 million in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: EMR(2022) \u2192 AspenTech: Emerson disclosed AspenTech's financial contribution, which was $0 in 2022, indicating the acquisition had not yet fully integrated AspenTech\u2019s operations.",
        "Hop 2: AspenTech \u2192 Performance Shares: AspenTech had its own stock-based compensation plans, which included performance shares, and these were integrated into Emerson\u2019s financial reporting post-acquisition.",
        "Hop 3: Performance Shares \u2190 EMR(2023): Emerson reported a significant increase in performance share expense in 2023, rising from $89 million in 2022 to $165 million in 2023, influenced by the inclusion of AspenTech\u2019s compensation plans."

      "answer": "In 2023, UPS relied on estimated net asset value (NAV) to value its U.S. pension plans' hedge fund investments, which required subjective assumptions and adjustments due to the lack of active trading. The $9.9 billion in total alternative investments, including hedge funds, were subject to significant auditor scrutiny because of the complexity and subjectivity in estimating NAV. By 2024, UPS had allocated $3,959 million specifically to hedge funds, representing 9.1% of U.S. plan assets. This indicates that despite the valuation challenges, UPS maintained a meaningful allocation to hedge funds, suggesting a continued belief in their diversification benefits within the pension strategy.",

      "question": "How did Lockheed Martin's increased exposure to fixed-price contracts in 2022, which limited its ability to pass through cost increases, affect its financial performance in 2023 amid industry-wide inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that a significant portion of its contracts were fixed-price in nature, under which the company agreed to perform specified work for a predetermined price, bearing the risk of cost overruns (LMT 10-K 2022). This contract structure became increasingly problematic in 2023 as industry-wide inflationary pressures and global supply chain disruptions led to higher material and labor costs. As noted in Raytheon's 2023 10-K, companies in the aerospace and defense sector faced rising input costs that could not always be offset due to the constraints of fixed-price contracts. Lockheed Martin itself acknowledged in its 2023 filing that fixed-price contracts exposed it to losses in the event of cost overruns, particularly when the U.S. Government used contract structures that shifted risk to the contractor. The combination of these factors likely constrained Lockheed Martin\u2019s profitability and cash flow in 2023, especially on programs where cost growth exceeded original estimates from 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Lockheed Martin Corporation\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\n\nOrganization - We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international  customers  with  products  and  services  that  have  defense,  civil  and  commercial  applications,  with  our  principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. As described in 'Note 4 - Information on Business Segments', we operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space.\n\nOn June 30, 2021, the UK Ministry of Defence terminated the contract to operate the UK's nuclear deterrent program and assumed control of the entity that manages the program (referred to as the renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE program)). Accordingly,  the AWE  program's  ongoing  operations,  including  the  entity  that  manages  the  program,  are  no longer included in our financial results as of that date, however, during 2021, AWE generated sales of $885 million and operating profit of $18 million, which are included in Space's financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December  31,  2020, AWE  generated  sales  of  $1.4  billion  and  operating  profit  of  $35  million,  which  are  included  in  Space's financial results for 2020.\n\nBasis of presentation - These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries we control and variable interest  entities  if  we  are  the  primary  beneficiary.  We  eliminate  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  in  consolidation.  We classify certain assets and liabilities as current utilizing the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is  generally  longer  than  one  year.  This  primarily  impacts  receivables,  contract  assets,  inventories,  and  contract  liabilities.  We classify all other assets and liabilities based on whether the asset will be realized or the liability will be paid within one year.\n\nUse of estimates - We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP).  In  doing  so,  we  are  required  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, accounting for sales and cost recognition; postretirement benefit plans; environmental liabilities and assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery; evaluation of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets for impairment; income taxes including deferred income taxes; fair value measurements; and contingencies.\n\nRevenue Recognition -The majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We account for a contract  when  it  has  approval  and  commitment  from  both  parties,  the  rights  of  the  parties  are  identified,  payment  terms  are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing  requirements,  primarily  international  direct  commercial  sale  contracts,  we  are  required  to  obtain  certain  regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixedprice  contracts  have  a  performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: costplus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within  specified  limits  based  on  the  customer's  assessment  of  our  performance  against  a  predetermined  set  of  criteria,  such  as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e.,",

      "question": "How did the change in the number and underwriting profile of GE's structured settlement annuities from 2023 to 2024 affect their exposure to mortality risk, and what implications does this have for future policy benefit reserves?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GE reinsured 24,600 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 56, primarily underwritten on impaired lives, which carry shorter-than-average life expectancies. These contracts exposed GE to mortality risk, where improved life expectancy could extend payment durations beyond estimates. By 2024, the number of such annuities decreased to 23,400, with an average attained age of 57, and only 27% underwritten on impaired lives\u2014indicating a shift toward healthier lives with potentially longer life expectancies. This shift increases GE's long-term mortality risk exposure, as longer life spans mean extended payment obligations. Given that GE cannot adjust premiums or reduce benefits on these contracts, the change likely necessitated an increase in future policy benefit reserves, especially as the company anticipates updating its actuarial assumptions during its annual review, which could result in higher liabilities being recognized in current period earnings.",

        "Hop 1: GE(2023) \u2192 Mortality Risk: GE faced mortality risk due to its portfolio of 24,600 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 56, primarily underwritten on impaired lives.",
        "Hop 2: Mortality Risk \u2192 Structured Settlement Annuities: Mortality risk negatively impacts structured settlement annuities by potentially extending payment durations if life expectancy improves beyond original estimates.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(a)    Pending completion of our December 31, 2024 statutory reporting process.\n\nStructured settlement annuities. We reinsure approximately 23,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 57. A pproximately 27% of these structured settlement annuities were underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than-average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment). Unlike long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nLife Insurance contracts. Our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. A t December 31, 2024, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance portfolio, we reinsure approximately $45 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.1 million policies with an average attained age of 63. In 2024, our incurred claims were approximately $0.4 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $46,100. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20- and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20- and 30-year level term policies, which represent approximately 7% and 43% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2026 and 2035 as the policies reach the end of their 20- and 30-year level premium period, respectively.\n\nCritical Accounting E stimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums and are estimated based on actuarial assumptions such as mortality, morbidity, terminations, and expenses. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings. Our annual review procedures include updating certain experience studies since our last completed review, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. The review of experience and assumptions is a comprehensive and complex process that depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. The review relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance portfolio includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.",

      "question": "How did the decline in Boeing's equity income from ULA between 2022 and 2024 correlate with its internal development and production strategy for launch services, particularly in light of its broader strategic focus on in-house space systems?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing reported equity income of $53 million from ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government. By 2024, Boeing had shifted toward in-house development and production of launch systems, including satellites, missile defense, and human space flight, as part of its broader strategy to deliver 'capability-driven solutions' and expand into next-generation programs. This shift correlates with a reduced emphasis on ULA as a strategic partner, suggesting a move toward internalizing launch capabilities. While the $53 million from ULA in 2022 was relatively modest compared to Boeing\u2019s overall revenue, the absence of a similar disclosure in 2024 filings indicates a reduced financial stake and strategic reliance on ULA, aligning with its increased focus on internal R&D and production of launch services.",

The $168 million reach-forward loss in the first quarter of 2020 on VC-25B was associated with engineering inefficiencies from the COVID-19 environment.\n\nBDS  earnings  from  operations  in  2020  decreased  by  $1,076  million  compared  with  2019  primarily  due  to  the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $828 million higher than the prior year, largely due to higher charges in 2020 of $1,320 million on KC-46A Tanker and $168 million on VC-25B, offset by $489 million in charges on Commercial Crew in 2019. The lower earnings in 2020 also reflect lower gains on property sales compared to the same period in 2019. These current period decreases were partially offset by the volume increases described above.\n\nBDS earnings from operations includes our share of income or loss from equity method investments of $53 million, $141 million and $128 million primarily from our ULA and non-U.S. joint ventures in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Backlog\n\nTotal backlog of $59,828 million at December 31, 2021 was $1,019 million lower than December 31, 2020 due to the timing of awards and revenue recognized.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\n\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis, and BDS customers are increasingly seeking fixed-price proposals for new programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew,  KC-46A  Tanker,  MQ-25,  T-7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B,  and  commercial  and  military  satellites.  A  number  of  our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reachforward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which  could  result  in  a  material  charge  or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  These  programs  are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery  dates  could  be  extended,  which  could  trigger  termination  provisions,  the  loss  of  satellite  in-orbit incentive payments or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.",

We  are  one  of  the  two  major  manufacturers  of  100+  seat  airplanes  for  the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in an expanding number of countries and rely on an extensiv e network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.\n\nOur strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses - Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space &amp; Security (BDS) and Global  Serv ices  (BGS).  BCA is committed to being the leader in commercial av iation by offering airplanes and serv ices that deliv er superior design, safety, quality, efficiency and v alue to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliv er capability-driv en solutions to customers at reduced costs.

Following the accident, the Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA)  grounded  and  required  inspections  of  all  737-9  aircraft  with  a  mid-exit  door  plug,  which  constituted  the  large majority of the approximately 220 737-9 aircraft in the in-serv ice fleet. On January 24, 2024, the FAA approv ed an enhanced maintenance and inspection process that was required to be performed on each of the grounded 737-9 aircraft. Our 737-9 operators returned their fleets to serv ice in the first quarter. All 737-9 aircraft in production are undergoing this same enhanced inspection process prior to deliv ery.\n\nAs a result of the accident, the  FAA performed an inv estigation into the 737 quality control system.  In the second quarter of 2024, we submitted a comprehensive safety and quality plan to the FAA to address the issues identified. As part of our plan to improv e quality and safety and to address the issues identified, we slowed production rates and delayed planned production rate increases to reduce trav eled work in our factory, as well as at our suppliers.  We also began taking additional actions to improv e safety and quality, which include inv esting in workforce training, simplifying plans and processes, eliminating defects, and enhancing our safety and quality culture.\n\nThe Alaska Airlines  accident  and  our  resulting  actions,  including  slowing  production,  to  improv e  compliance  with  our  manufacturing  quality  control requirements significantly impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows during 2024.\n\nOn November 4, 2024, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 (IAM 751) v oted to ratify a new contract, thereby ending the work stoppage initiated on September 13, 2024, which paused production of certain commercial aircraft models (737, 767, 777 and 777X aircraft)  as  well  as  production  of  commercial  deriv ativ e  aircraft  for  our  Defense,  Space  &amp;  Security  business  (KC-46A  T anker  and  P-8A  Poseidon). Production for all programs resumed in December 2024.\n\nThe IAM 751 work stoppage significantly reduced aircraft deliv eries in the second half of 2024.

This shift simplified the actuarial modeling but increased sensitivity to general morbidity trends. By 2024, GE's exposure to adverse changes in morbidity assumptions became more pronounced, as noted in its risk factors, with the potential for increased future policy benefit reserves and required capital contributions to insurance subsidiaries. Specifically, the 2024 disclosures highlighted that future adverse changes in morbidity (among other assumptions) could necessitate additional capital infusions, such as the $X million already contributed in Q1 2024 under the KID-approved statutory permitted practice. This indicates that the streamlined morbidity assumptions from 2022 increased GE's financial exposure to unexpected morbidity trends by 2024, heightening the risk of further capital needs.",

          "chunk_text": "Our run-off insurance operations have approximately $0.8 billion of assets held by states or other regulatory bodies in statutorily required deposit accounts, and approximately $31.0 billion of assets held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts and reinsurance security trust agreements in place between either ERAC or UFLIC as the reinsuring entity and a number of ceding insurers. Assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contracts and trust agreements. Some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of ERAC or UFLIC which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates and benefit utilization rates); morbidity improvement (i.e., assumed rate of improvement in morbidity in the future); mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force); anticipated premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, including actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2030, on long-term care insurance policies; and interest rates. Assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.\n\nClaim reserves . Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. Key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. Claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.\n\nReinsurance recoverables . We cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies, and record receivables for estimated recoveries as we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholders or cedents. These receivables are estimated in a manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves. Reserves ceded to reinsurers, net of allowance, were $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in the caption All other assets in our Statement of Financial Position.\n\nPremium Deficiency Testing . We annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. The premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. A comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. Premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nThe primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include:\n\nMorbidity . Morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. For long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last). Prior to 2017, premium deficiency assumptions considered the risk of anti-selection by including issue age adjustments to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long-term care policies issued to younger individuals would exhibit lower expected incidences and claim costs than those issued to older policyholders. Recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curves indicated issue age differences had minimal impact on claim cost projections, and, accordingly, beginning in 2017, issue age adjustments were eliminated in developing morbidity assumptions. Higher morbidity increases, while lower morbidity decreases, the present value of expected future benefit payments.",

          "chunk_text": "Our run-off insurance operations have approximately $0.8 billion of assets held by states or other regulatory bodies in statutorily required deposit accounts, and approximately $31.0 billion of assets held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts and reinsurance security trust agreements in place between either ERAC or UFLIC as the reinsuring entity and a number of ceding insurers. Assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contracts and trust agreements. Some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of ERAC or UFLIC which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates and benefit utilization rates); morbidity improvement (i.e., assumed rate of improvement in morbidity in the future); mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force); anticipated premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, including actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2030, on long-term care insurance policies; and interest rates. Assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.\n\nClaim reserves . Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. Key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. Claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.\n\nReinsurance recoverables . We cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies, and record receivables for estimated recoveries as we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholders or cedents. These receivables are estimated in a manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves. Reserves ceded to reinsurers, net of allowance, were $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in the caption All other assets in our Statement of Financial Position.\n\nPremium Deficiency Testing . We annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. The premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. A comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. Premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nThe primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include:\n\nMorbidity . Morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. For long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last). Prior to 2017, premium deficiency assumptions considered the risk of anti-selection by including issue age adjustments to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long-term care policies issued to younger individuals would exhibit lower expected incidences and claim costs than those issued to older policyholders. Recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curves indicated issue age differences had minimal impact on claim cost projections, and, accordingly, beginning in 2017, issue age adjustments were eliminated in developing morbidity assumptions. Higher morbidity increases, while lower morbidity decreases, the present value of expected future benefit payments.",

          "chunk_text": "face. The airline industry has historically been highly cyclical, and sustained economic growth and political stability in both developed and emerging markets are principal factors underlying long-term air traffic growth; the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and the potential for recession or armed conflict pose risks to the rate of that growth. A  potential future disruption in connection with a terrorist incident, war, cy berattack, actual or threatened public health pandemic or emergency or recessionary economic environment that results in the loss of business and leisure traffic could also adversely affect our customers, their ability  to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely  fashion or at all, demand for our products and serv ices and the v iability  of a customer's business. (See also Risk Factors - Commercial aviation sector.) In addition, our customers include governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. federal government. Sustained and increased funding from government customers supports research, new product development, production and aftermarket business for our defense business, and a variety of domestic and international political, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including recession, can materially affect our customers' ability to secure budget support and fund these activities year after year. We also at times face greater challenges collecting on receivables with customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging markets. If there is significant deterioration in the global economy, in our sector, in financial markets or with particular significant counterparties, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n\nRun-off insurance and banking operations - We continue to have exposure to our run-off insurance operations and Bank BPH mortgage portfolio in Poland . While in recent years we have greatly reduced the scope of GE's former financial services operations, we continue to retain significant exposure to legacy insurance and other financial services operations that will run off over a long period of time and, in the event of future adverse developments, could cause funding or liquidity  stress. For ex ample, it is possible that results of our statutory  testing of insurance reserv es in future y ears will require additional capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, even after the capital contribution made in the first quarter of 2024 that completed the contributions in connection with the statutory permitted practice approved in 2018 by the Kansas Insurance Department (KID). Our statutory testing of insurance reserves is subject to a variety of assumptions, including assumptions about the discount rate (which is sensitive to changes in market interest rates), morbidity, mortality and future long-term care premium increases. Future adverse changes to these assumptions (to the extent not offset by any favorable changes to these assumptions) could result in an increase to future policy benefit reserves and, potentially, to the amount of capital we are required to contribute to our insurance subsidiaries (as discussed in the Other Items - Insurance section within the M D&amp;A ). In addition, we have exposure to various financial counterparties that pose credit and other risks in the event of insolvency or other default. For example, a portion of our run-off insurance operations' assets are held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts. For our UFLIC subsidiary, such trust assets are currently held in trusts for the benefit of insurance company subsidiaries of Genworth, which has stated in the past that it will not bolster the capital position of its insurance subsidiaries. Solvency or other concerns about Genworth or its insurance company subsidiaries may cause those subsidiaries or their regulators to take or attempt to take actions that could adversely affect UFLIC, including control over assets in the relevant trusts. It is also possible that additional contingent liabilities and loss estimates for Bank BPH, in connection with the ongoing litigation in Poland related to its portfolio of residential mortgage loans denominated in or indexed to foreign currencies (see Note 24), will need to be recognized (or loss estimates may increase in the future) and will require additional capital contributions. Regulatory requirements and agreements with respect to our run-off insurance operations and Bank BPH require us to maintain adequate levels of capital and could require additional infusion of capital if the required levels are not maintained. Though we may consider strategic options to accelerate the further reduction in the size of these remaining financial services operations, such options may not be viable or attractive because of the associated cash payments, financial charges or other adverse effects. There can be no assurance that future liabilities, losses or impairments to the carrying value of assets within our financial services operations would not materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\n\nBorrowings &amp; liquidity - We may face risks related to the refinancing of our debt, particularly in severely adverse market conditions, and future credit downgrades could adversely affect our liquidity, funding costs and related margins. We intend to maintain a sustainable investment-grade long-term credit rating, but there can be no assurance that we will not face future credit rating downgrades as a result of factors such as a change in business strategy or performance, or changes in rating application or methodology. Future downgrades could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity and competitive position, and external conditions in the financial and credit markets may limit our availability to refinance our debt at particular times or on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, if we are unable to generate cash flows in accordance with our plans or face unforeseen needs for capital, we may adopt changes to our capital allocation plans (such as plans related to the timing or amounts of investments or capital expenditures, share repurchases or dividends) or take other actions. Further, our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations are exposed to economic factors, such as changes in interest rates, investment performance of plan assets, and health care costs, which could adversely impact our leverage and liquidity. For additional discussion about our credit ratings, financial conditions and related considerations, refer to the Capital Resources and Liquidity section within M D&amp;A . For discussion regarding how our financial statements have been and can be affected by our pension and healthcare benefit obligations, see Note 13.\n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS. Legal and compliance risk relates to risks arising from the government and regulatory environment, legal proceedings and compliance with integrity policies and procedures, including matters relating to financial reporting and the environment, health and safety. Government and regulatory risk includes the risk that government or regulatory actions will impose additional cost on us or require us to make adverse changes to our business models or practices.\n\nRegulatory - We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and government policies that require ongoing compliance efforts and may change in significant ways. Our business is subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies that require ongoing compliance efforts. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and policies will not be changed or interpreted or enforced in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them",

      "answer": "In 2023, UPS disclosed 127 shares of Class A common stock and 726 shares of Class B common stock issued, which shifted to 121 and 733 shares respectively in 2024. This indicates a decrease in Class A shares by 6 and an increase in Class B shares by 7. The intermediate evidence from Comcast\u2019s filing highlights that Class B shares are convertible into Class A shares, suggesting that UPS\u2019s equity structure changes could reflect conversions or strategic adjustments in shareholder control. The increase in Class B shares, which typically carry higher voting power as seen in similar structures like Comcast\u2019s, could imply a consolidation of voting rights, potentially affecting corporate governance dynamics moving forward.",

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS had 134 shares of Class A common stock issued, which decreased to 127 shares in 2023. Meanwhile, the number of Class B shares remained relatively stable, increasing only slightly from 725 to 726. According to the 2022 disclosure, Class A shareholders collectively hold 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B shareholders hold 33 1/3%, with each Class B share carrying 15 votes. The reduction in Class A shares in 2023 would slightly increase the relative voting weight of each remaining Class A share, but since the Class B shares maintain a non-dilutable 33 1/3% voting power under the company's structure, the core balance of control remains largely unchanged despite the decrease in issued Class A shares.",

Stock option awards vest over a five-year period with approximately 20% of the award vesting at each anniversary of the grant date (except in the case of death, disability or retirement, in which case immediate vesting occurs). The option grants expire 10 years after the date of the grant.

      "answer": "In 2022, BA's pension fund assets were primarily invested in a balanced index fund consisting of approximately 60% equities and 40% debt securities. During that year, the fund experienced significant unrealized losses in Level 3 assets still held at year-end, including ($16) for corporate fixed income, ($11) for mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed income, ($14) for municipal fixed income, and ($1) for real asset securities. By 2023, the fund maintained the same 60/40 allocation to equities and debt within the balanced index fund, but the unrealized performance improved markedly, with gains of $2 for corporate fixed income, $6 for mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed income, and $3 for other fixed income securities. This shift indicates a stabilization or recovery in certain fixed income markets, even though the fund's structure remained unchanged year-over-year.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

      "question": "How did the evolution of RTX's compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requirements in 2022 influence the structure and payment terms of its U.S. Government Contracts in 2024, particularly regarding progress payments and contract asset recognition?",
      "answer": "In 2022, RTX operated under the FAR, which governed cost allowability and payment structures in U.S. government contracts, leading to progress payments capped at 80-90% of incurred costs and the creation of contract assets due to revenue recognized in excess of billings. By 2024, RTX continued to apply FAR-based pricing and payment mechanisms, maintaining the same 80-90% progress payment structure. However, the increased use of percentage-of-completion revenue recognition for long-term contracts under FAR guidelines in 2024 led to a more structured build-up of contract assets, reflecting a more consistent alignment between cost incurrence and revenue recognition over time. This shows that RTX's adherence to FAR in 2022 directly shaped the financial structure and payment dynamics of its U.S. Government Contracts in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: RTX(2022) \u2192 FAR: RTX was subject to FAR regulations which dictated cost allowability and payment terms such as 80-90% progress payments on fixed-price contracts.",

        "Hop 3: U.S. Government Contracts \u2190 RTX(2024): In 2024, RTX continued to disclose the same payment structures under FAR and showed increased use of percentage-of-completion revenue recognition, leading to more systematic contract asset build-up."

The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment.  Such  advances  are  not  considered  a  significant  financing  component  because  they  are  used  to  meet  working  capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress, as sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of performing services under the contract is incurred on an other-than-straight-line basis. For some of our long-term aftermarket contracts, we receive payment prior to delivery of products and services, resulting in a contract liability balance, while for others, we deliver products or services in advance of payment, resulting in a contract asset balance.\n\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services that are not distinct are accounted for as part of the existing contract either on a cumulative catch-up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification.\n\nLoss provisions on contracts are recognized to the extent that estimated contract costs exceed the estimated consideration from the products or services contemplated under the contractual arrangement. For new commitments, we generally record loss provisions at contract signing except for certain contracts under which losses are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates us to perform. For existing commitments, anticipated losses on contractual arrangements are recognized in the period in which losses become evident. In estimating losses, products contemplated under contractual arrangements include firm quantities of product sold under contract and, in the commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, future highly probable sales of replacement parts required by regulation that are expected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment. In our commercial engine  and  wheels  and  brakes  businesses,  when  the  OEM  product  is  sold  for  a  loss,  but  the  combined  OEM  and  aftermarket arrangement for each individual sales campaign is profitable, we record OEM product losses at the time of product delivery.\n\nWe review our Estimate at Completion (EACs) on significant contracts on a periodic basis and for others, no less than annually or when  a  change  in  circumstances  warrant  a  modification  to  a  previous  estimate.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  work  required  to  be performed on many of the Company's performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks  and  opportunities  relate  to  management's  judgment  about  the  ability  and  cost  to  achieve  the  schedule,  consideration  of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or  aircraft  landings,  and  related  variable  consideration.  Management's  judgment  related  to  these  considerations  has  become increasingly more significant given the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity  and  scope  of  the  work  to  be  performed,  the  availability  and  cost  of  materials,  the  length  of  time  to  complete  the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives  of  components,  among  others.  Cost  estimates  may  also  include  the  estimated  cost  of  satisfying  our  industrial  cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts primarily within our RIS and RMD",

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price when available. If standalone selling price is not available, we estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, which is generally based on an expected cost-plus-a-margin approach.\n\nWe  consider  the  contractual  consideration  payable  by  the  customer  and  assess  variable  consideration  that  may  affect  the  total  transaction  price,  including contractual  discounts,  contract  incentive  payments,  estimates  of  award  fees,  flight  hours,  aircraft  landings  or  other  customer  usage  activities  on  long-term maintenance contracts, and other sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract. We account for consideration payable to a customer as a reduction of revenue. Consideration payable to a customer may include cash amounts we are obligated to pay or expect to pay a customer, as well as credits or other items that can be applied against amounts owed to us. In our Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses, we may offer customer incentives to purchase our products, which may result in payments made to those customers.\n\nWhen reasonably able to estimate, we include variable consideration in the transaction price at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance, and our best judgment at the time. We also consider whether our contracts contain a significant financing component, which they generally do not.\n\nTiming of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across our businesses due to our diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied as of a point-in-time for certain aerospace components, engines, and spare parts. Revenue is recognized when control of the product transfers to the customer, generally upon product shipment. Since billing also typically occurs upon product shipment, we generally do not have Contract assets or Contract liabilities balances related to point-in-time sales.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced (continuous transfer of control), or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment for performance to date. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts.\n\nSubstantially all of our defense business revenue, which primarily relates to our Raytheon segment, and to a lesser extent Pratt &amp; Whitney and Collins, is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to our customers. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage-ofcompletion basis generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs can include labor, materials, subcontractors' costs, or other direct costs and indirect costs. Our contracts with the U.S. government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services.

In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis.\n\nHolders of Class A common stock in the aggregate hold 66 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock. The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class B common stock having 15 votes per share. The Class B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\nRecord holders as of December 31, 2021 are presented in the table below.\n\n",

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin's Space segment continued to include its share of earnings from the United Launch Alliance (ULA) in both 2022 and 2024 filings, indicating stable strategic involvement with ULA over this period. However, the company's RMS division saw a significant shift, with net sales increasing by $1.0 billion (6%) in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by growth in IWSS programs, C6ISR programs, and Sikorsky helicopter production. This substantial RMS growth contrasts with the consistent ULA earnings inclusion, suggesting Lockheed maintained its space launch partnership while strategically prioritizing expansion in other defense and aerospace domains. Specific Space segment financial metrics aren't directly comparable between years due to format differences in reporting, but the continued mention of ULA earnings inclusion indicates no material change in that relationship despite broader strategic shifts.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Boeing's BDS and BGS defense businesses generated 58% and 65% of their revenues from fixed-price contracts, which exposed them to significant cost overruns. This led to $1,585 million in additional losses on major fixed-price development programs such as the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew. These cost overruns were exacerbated by production disruptions, supplier instability, and technical challenges. By 2024, Boeing's Commercial Airplanes (BCA) business remained exposed to similar risks, particularly through firm fixed-price contracts with indexed price escalation clauses.

Risk Factors\n\nAn investment in our securities inv olv es risks and uncertainties, including those described below , which can materially affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. These risk factors should be carefully rev iewed in conjunction with the other information in this report, including  'Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations'  and  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and related notes. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Operations\n\n## We depend heavily on commercial airlines, subjecting us to unique risks.\n\nMarket  conditions  have  a  significant  impact  on  demand  for  our  commercial  aircraft  and  related  services. The  commercial  aircraft  market  is predominantly driv en by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability in both dev eloped and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by additional factors  including  airline  profitability,  av ailability  of  aircraft  financing,  trade  policies,  geopolitics,  technological  adv ances,  price  and  other  competitiv e factors,  fuel  prices,  inflationary  pressures,  terrorism,  pandemics,  epidemics,  sustainability-related  preferences,  env ironmental  regulations,  and reputational factors. Historically, the airline industry has been cyclical and v ery competitiv e and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges  to  be  more  cost  competitiv e.  Significant  deterioration  in  the  global  economic  env ironment,  the  airline  industry  generally  or  the  financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or serv ices, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower rev enues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog.  In  addition,  because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for deliv ery ov er a period of sev eral years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could affect deliv eries ov er a long period.\n\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts w ith indexed price escalation clauses, w hich subjects us to losses if w e have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are typically entered into years before the aircraft are deliv ered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and deliv ery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas deriv ed from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our rev enue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact rev enues and operating margins in our BCA business.\n\nWe derive  a  significant  portion  of  our  revenues  from  a  limited  number  of  commercial  airlines. We  can  make  no  assurance  that  any  customer  will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or serv ices from us. In addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations  or  financial  challenges  inv olv ing  any  of  our  major  commercial  airline  customers  could  significantly  reduce  our  rev enues  and  limit  our opportunity  to  generate  profits  from  those  customers.  Airlines  also  are  experiencing  increased  fuel  and  other  costs,  and  the  global  economy  has experienced and may continue to experience high inflation.\n\nOur Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, ensure every airplane in our production system conforms to exacting specifications,",

      "answer": "GE's exposure to structured settlement annuities decreased from 24,600 contracts in 2023 to 23,400 contracts in 2024, reflecting a reduction of 1,200 contracts. Since these contracts are negatively impacted by reinvestment risk\u2014particularly in a low interest rate environment\u2014and do not allow for adjustments to premiums or benefits, this reduction likely lessened the company's vulnerability to prolonged low-yield investment conditions. However, the continued high volume of contracts (23,400 in 2024) and their long-term nature (with payments extending decades into the future) means that GE still faces significant reinvestment risk tied to these liabilities, especially as the average attained age of annuitants increased from 56 to 57, potentially extending the duration of future payments.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(a)    Pending completion of our December 31, 2024 statutory reporting process.\n\nStructured settlement annuities. We reinsure approximately 23,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 57. A pproximately 27% of these structured settlement annuities were underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than-average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment). Unlike long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nLife Insurance contracts. Our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. A t December 31, 2024, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance portfolio, we reinsure approximately $45 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.1 million policies with an average attained age of 63. In 2024, our incurred claims were approximately $0.4 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $46,100. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20- and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20- and 30-year level term policies, which represent approximately 7% and 43% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2026 and 2035 as the policies reach the end of their 20- and 30-year level premium period, respectively.\n\nCritical Accounting E stimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums and are estimated based on actuarial assumptions such as mortality, morbidity, terminations, and expenses. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings. Our annual review procedures include updating certain experience studies since our last completed review, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. The review of experience and assumptions is a comprehensive and complex process that depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. The review relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance portfolio includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing disclosed an unrealized loss of ($1) million for mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed income securities held in its pension portfolio, indicating a decline in value compared to the prior year. These securities were included within fixed income investments and were valued based on closing prices or yields on comparable securities, as noted in MMM_10k_2022.pdf. By 2024, Boeing had shifted its valuation methodology for fixed income investments, including mortgage-backed securities, to rely more heavily on NAV-based valuations calculated by fund managers or custodians, especially for pooled funds and private debt. This evolution suggests a more indirect, fund-level approach to valuation in 2024 versus the more direct market yield and price-based methods used in 2022. This change may reflect a broader strategic shift in how Boeing manages and values its pension assets, potentially prioritizing liquidity and fund-level expertise over direct market valuation.",

      "question": "How did UPS's contributions to the New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund in 2022 relate to the FIP requirements in 2023, and what does this indicate about the company's pension obligation management over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UPS contributed $147 million to the New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund, which was subject to a Financial Improvement Plan (FIP) or Rehabilitation Plan (RP) due to its red-zone funding status. By 2023, UPS's contributions to the same pension fund decreased to $139 million, and the company confirmed that its collectively bargained contributions satisfied the implemented FIP/RP requirements without requiring surcharges. This indicates that UPS managed its pension obligations more efficiently in 2023, contributing less while still meeting regulatory requirements, suggesting improved alignment with FIP/RP obligations or a stabilization in the fund\u2019s funding gap.",

        "Hop 1: [UPS](2022) \u2192 [New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund]: UPS contributed $147 million in 2022 to this underfunded (red zone) pension plan.",
        "Hop 2: [New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund] \u2192 [FIP Requirements]: The fund was subject to an implemented FIP/RP due to its red-zone status, requiring UPS to meet specific contribution thresholds.",

      "question": "How did the transition from the Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan to the 2023 Plan impact the number of shares issued from Treasury stock in 2023 versus 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's equity award activity following the plan replacement?",
      "answer": "The transition from the 2014 Plan to the 2023 Plan coincided with a decrease in the number of shares issued from Treasury stock, from 2,497,799 shares in 2023 to 1,972,037 shares in 2024. This suggests that the adoption of the new plan in 2023 did not immediately lead to higher issuance levels, and instead, equity award activity declined slightly in the following year. The 2023 Plan, which superseded the 2014 Plan, authorized 42,500,000 shares, with 40,873,176 remaining available for issuance by the end of 2024, indicating a slower uptake of equity awards post-transition.",

      "answer": "In FDX's 2023 filing, the auditor (Ernst & Young LLP) focused on testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in content amortization models, particularly around historical and forecasted viewing patterns. By 2024, the focus of the completeness and accuracy testing had shifted to pension liabilities, where the auditor tested the accuracy of participant data provided to actuarial specialists in determining the $5.6 billion in self-insurance accruals. While the auditor remained consistent (EY since 2002), their application of completeness and accuracy evaluations changed from content amortization assumptions in 2023 to pension liability data inputs in 2024, reflecting FDX's evolving reporting priorities.",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                 | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results.

          "chunk_text": "on a different timeline than expected. If we are unable to complete any of the separations, we will have incurred costs without realizing the benefits of such transaction. In addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the independent companies. And, although we intend for the separation transactions to be tax-free to the Company's shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect to incur non-U.S. cash taxes on the preparatory restructuring and may also incur non-cash tax expense including potential impairments of deferred tax assets. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the separation transactions will qualify as taxfree for U.S. purposes. If the separation transactions were ultimately determined to be taxable, we would incur a significant tax liability, while the distributions to the Company's shareholders would become taxable and the new independent companies might incur income tax liabilities as well. Furthermore, if the separation transactions are completed, we cannot be assured that each separate company will be successful.\n\nWhether or not the separation transactions are completed, our businesses may face material challenges in connection with these transactions, including, without limitation the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on the businesses of the Company; appropriately allocating assets and liabilities among the three companies, particularly given the staggered nature of the separation transactions; maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; retaining existing or attracting new business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties; assigning customer contracts and intellectual property to each of the businesses; and potential negative reactions from the financial markets. In particular, GE for the past several years has been undertaking various restructuring and business transformation actions (including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives) that have entailed changes across our organizational structure, senior leadership, culture, functional alignment, outsourcing and other areas. This poses risks in the form of personnel capacity constraints and institutional knowledge loss that could lead to missed performance or financial targets, loss of key personnel and harm to our reputation, and these risks are heightened with the additional interdependent actions that will be needed to complete the planned separation transactions. Moreover, completion of the separation transactions will result in the three independent public companies that are smaller, less diversified companies with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries than GE is today. As a result, each company may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the diversification of revenues, costs, and cash flows will diminish, such that each company's results of operations, cash flows, working capital, effective tax rate, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and its ability to fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and meet debt obligations and other liabilities may be diminished. Each of the separate companies will also incur ongoing costs, including costs of operating as independent companies, that the separated businesses will no longer be able to share. Additionally, we cannot predict whether the market value of our common stock and the common stock of each of the new independent companies after the separation transactions will be, in the aggregate, less than, equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to the separation transactions. If the separation transactions are completed, investors holding our common stock may sell the common stock of any of the new independent companies that do not match their investment strategies, which may cause a decline in the market price of such common stock.\n\nCOVID-19 - The global COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. Our operations and financial performance since early 2020 have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that has caused, and may continue to cause, a slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), disruptions in global supply chains and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect economic activity globally or in various regions, the extent to which this will adversely impact our future operations and financial performance is uncertain. Across all of our businesses, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience operational challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety, site shutdowns, workplace disruptions and restrictions on the movement of people, raw materials and goods, both at our own facilities and at those of our customers and suppliers, global supply chain disruptions and price inflation. We also have experienced, and may continue experiencing, lower demand and volume for products and services, customer requests for potential payment deferrals or other contract modifications, supply chain under-liquidation, delays of deliveries and the achievement of other billing milestones, delays or cancellations of new projects and related down payments and other factors related directly and indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on our customers that adversely impact our businesses. In particular, interruptions of regional and international air travel from COVID-19 are having a material adverse effect on our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our services and products. While our Aviation business is showing continued signs of recovery, the recently renewed intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic in many parts of the world could stall the recovery achieved to date and lead to future requests for payment deferrals, contract modifications, and similar actions across the aviation sector, which may lead to additional charges, impairments and other adverse financial impacts, or to customer disputes.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including the impact of coronavirus variants and resurgences; governmental, business and individuals' actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions on travel and transport and workforce pressures); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments or vaccines; our employees' compliance with vaccine mandates that may apply in various jurisdictions; the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace and extent of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. A number of accounting estimates that we make have been and will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainties related to these and other factors, and our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to COVID-19 (see Note 1). As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our operating and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors described below.",

      "answer": "EMR acquired NI in October 2023 for an undisclosed amount, though NI had revenues of approximately $1.7 billion and pretax earnings of $170 million in the 12 months prior to acquisition. In 2024, NI (now part of EMR's Test & Measurement segment) generated $1,464 million in sales but resulted in a net loss of $537 million, largely due to inventory step-up amortization, intangibles amortization, and restructuring costs. This indicates that while the automated test systems contributed significant revenue, the integration and acquisition-related expenses led to a substantial short-term financial drag. The change reflects the initial challenges of integrating a newly acquired business despite its strategic alignment.",

      "question": "How did GD's use of NAV for valuing hedge fund investments change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's reporting approach for Level 2 assets?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GD reported $2 million in hedge funds measured using NAV as a practical expedient, indicating a small but explicit reliance on NAV for certain hard-to-value assets. By 2024, GD continued to use NAV for defined benefit plan assets, specifically referencing its application in Level 2 assets, which include commingled funds valued using observable inputs. This suggests GD maintained NAV as a valuation technique but potentially expanded its use contextually within Level 2 reporting. The continuity of NAV usage reflects a consistent approach to valuing less liquid or indirectly held investments.",

We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered. Following is a brief description of the activities of our business segments:\n\n- Aeronautics - Engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies.\n- Missiles and Fire Control - Provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; ground vehicles; and energy management solutions.\n- Rotary and Mission Systems - Designs, manufactures, services and supports various military and commercial helicopters, sea- and land-based missile defense systems, radar systems, laser systems, sea- and air-based mission and combat systems, command and control mission solutions, cyber solutions, simulation and training solutions, and services and supports surface ships.\n- Space -  E ngaged in the research and design, development, engineering and production of satellites, space transportation systems, and strategic, advanced strike, and defensive systems. Space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground global systems to help our customers gather, analyze and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Operating profit for our Space business segment also includes our share of earnings for our 50% ownership interest in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. G overnment and commercial customers. Our investment in ULA totaled $551 million and $567 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023.",

The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of $320 million for national security space programs due to lower volume on classified programs and $145 million for commercial civil space due to lower volume on the Orion program, partially offset by higher volume on other space exploration programs. These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of $255 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume on FBM and reentry programs.\n\nSpace's operating profit in 2024 increased $68 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to $100 million related to favorable contract mix and cost recoveries across the portfolio, partially offset by $55 million of lower profit booking rate adjustments due to lower net favorable profit rate adjustments on the Orion program and $25 million of higher equity earnings driven by higher launch volume from our investment in ULA.\n\n## Equity earnings\n\nTotal equity earnings (attributable to our investment in ULA) represented approximately $45 million and $20 million, or 4% and 2%, of Space's operating profit during 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Backlog\n\nBacklog increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher orders for National Security Space for classified programs, Commercial Civil Space for G eoXO program, and Strategic and Missiles Defense for FBM Mk7 program.",

      "question": "How did the extension of ASU 2020-04's sunset date via ASU 2022-06 impact FedEx's ability to manage LIBOR-related contract modifications in 2024 compared to 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2023, FedEx was subject to ASU 2020-04, which provided temporary relief for accounting related to reference rate reform (e.g., LIBOR discontinuation), but its original sunset date of December 31, 2022, posed limitations. The issuance of ASU 2022-06 deferred the sunset date to December 31, 2024, allowing FedEx to continue applying simplified accounting treatments for LIBOR-related contract modifications and hedging relationships through 2024. As of May 31, 2024, FedEx reported no material financial impact from reference rate reform, but the extended relief under ASU 2022-06 gave the company more time to monitor and adapt contracts referencing LIBOR, which was especially important given the June 30, 2023 discontinuation of certain LIBOR tenors. This extension directly enhanced FedEx\u2019s flexibility in managing financial reporting complexities associated with reference rate reform across both years.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: FDX(2023) \u2192 ASU 2020-04: FedEx was subject to ASU 2020-04 in 2023, which provided temporary accounting relief related to LIBOR reform but was originally set to expire on December 31, 2022.",
        "Hop 2: ASU 2020-04 \u2192 ASU 2022-06: ASU 2022-06 deferred the sunset date of ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, allowing continued application of the optional expedients for LIBOR-related contracts and hedging relationships.",
        "Hop 3: ASU 2022-06 \u2190 FDX(2024): In 2024, FedEx remained subject to ASU 2022-06, which extended the relief through 2024, enabling the company to continue monitoring and managing LIBOR-related contracts without material financial impact as of May 31, 2024."

The standards provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to existing contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The standards apply only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') or another reference rate to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The standards were effective upon issuance and can generally be applied through December 31, 2024. While there has been no material effect to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows from reference rate reform as of May 31, 2024, we continue to monitor our contracts and transactions for potential application of these ASUs.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which expands disclosures about a public entity's reportable segments and requires more enhanced information about a reportable segment's expenses, interim segment profit or loss, and how a public entity's chief operating decision maker uses reported segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and allocating resources. The update will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 (fiscal 2025). We are assessing the effect of this update on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands disclosures in an entity's income tax rate reconciliation table and regarding cash taxes paid both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The update will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 (fiscal 2026). We are assessing the effect of this update on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nIn March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') adopted final rules requiring public entities to provide certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. As part of the disclosures, entities will be required to quantify certain effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions in a note to their audited financial statements. The rules will be effective for annual periods beginning in calendar 2025 (fiscal 2026). In April 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed implementation of the final rules pending certain legal challenges. We are assessing the effect of the new rules on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 3: CREDIT LOSSES\n\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our trade receivables. We assess ability to pay for certain customers by conducting a credit review, which considers the customer's established credit rating and our assessment of creditworthiness. We determine the allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable using a combination of specific reserves for accounts that are deemed to exhibit credit loss indicators and general reserves that are determined using loss rates based on historical write-offs by geography and recent forecast information, including underlying economic expectations. We update our estimate of credit loss reserves quarterly, considering recent write-offs, collections information, and underlying economic expectations.\n\nCredit losses were $421 million in 2024, $696 million in 2023, and $403 million in 2022. Our allowance for credit losses was $436 million at May 31, 2024 and $472 million at May 31, 2023.",

      "question": "How did GE's shift in investment focus from commercial mortgage loans in 2023 to CMBS in 2024 reflect changes in their asset-backed securities strategy, particularly in terms of sector diversification and risk profile?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GE's insurance operations held commercial mortgage loans, which were part of their run-off portfolio and referenced in Note 12 (GE_10k_2023.pdf). These loans directly contributed to the composition of CMBS, as evidenced by MET_10k_2023.pdf, which states that CMBS are securities collateralized by multiple commercial mortgage loans. By 2024, GE had transitioned toward direct investments in CMBS, as noted in GE_10k_2024.pdf, where it was reported that CMBS investments were part of a broader portfolio including residential MBS, non-U.S. bonds, and government debt. This evolution indicates a strategic shift from holding individual commercial mortgage loans to investing in diversified, structured CMBS instruments, suggesting a move toward broader sector exposure and potentially more risk-managed asset-backed investments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, RTX's financial stability was heavily dependent on U.S. government contracts, which were at risk of termination or funding delays, potentially leading to revenue shortfalls and liquidity issues. These contracts were governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which outlines the criteria for allowable costs and payment structures. By 2023, RTX adjusted its revenue recognition practices under FAR to accommodate the specific payment terms of these government contracts, including performance-based payments (PBPs) and progress payments. Under PBPs, RTX received interim payments based on quantifiable performance metrics or milestones, while progress payments typically covered 80\u201390% of incurred costs as work progressed. These structured payment mechanisms helped mitigate the financial risks associated with potential contract terminations or delayed funding, aligning with the evolving regulatory framework and ensuring more predictable cash flow management.",

Significant changes in U.S. government defense spending or changes in U.S. government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\nWe Face Risks Relating to Our U.S. Government Contracts and the Mix of Our U.S. Government Contracts and Programs that Could Negatively Impact our Financial Condition, Results of Operations, Liquidity and Overall Business. The termination of one or more of our contracts, or the occurrence of performance delays, cost overruns, product failures, materials or components shortages,  or  contract  definitization  delays,  could  negatively  impact  our  competitive  position,  results  of  operations,  financial condition and liquidity. U.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without  prior  notice,  at  the  U.S.  government's  convenience  or  for  default  based  on  performance.  If  one  of  our  contracts  is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for work accepted by the U.S. government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. In addition, we are a subcontractor on some contracts and the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, without regard to our performance as a subcontractor. We can give no assurance that we would be awarded new U.S. government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of the termination  of  any  of  our  contracts.  In  addition,  because  the  funding  of  U.S.  government  programs  is  subject  to  congressional appropriations made on a fiscal year basis even for multi-year programs, programs are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future years. Appropriation bills may be delayed, which may result in delays to funding, the collection of receivables and our contract performance due to lack of authorized funds to procure related products and services. Under certain circumstances, we may use our own funds to meet our customer's desired delivery dates or other requirements, but we may not be reimbursed. Further, if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable, reduced or delayed, the U.S. government may terminate for  convenience our contract or subcontract under that program. In addition, our U.S. government contracts typically involve  the  development,  application  and  manufacture  of  advanced  defense  and  technology  systems  and  products  aimed  at achieving  challenging  goals.  New  technologies  may  be  untested  or  unproven  and  in  some  instances,  product  requirements  or specifications may be modified. As a result, we may experience technological and other performance difficulties, which may result in delays, setbacks, cost overruns or product failures, and could divert our attention or resources from other projects. Our failure to execute effectively on our development programs could impact our future sales opportunities. Additionally, in order to win certain U.S. government contracts, we may be required to invest in development prior to award as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions. These additional investments may not be worthwhile if we are not chosen for these awards.\n\nOur U.S. government contracts are typically either fixed-priced contracts or cost reimbursement contracts. Fixed-price contracts are predominantly either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, we generally share with the U.S. government savings for cost underruns less than target costs and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated ceiling price. We carry the entire burden of cost overruns exceeding the ceiling price amount under FPI contracts. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed or performance-based fee, but  we  are  generally  not  reimbursed  for  unauthorized  costs  exceeding  a  cost  ceiling  amount  or  costs  not  allowable  under  the contract or applicable regulations. If we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, our profitability could be negatively affected, particularly under fixed-price development contracts. We may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenues, and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenues. While contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are  typically  cost  reimbursable,  they  can  be  FFP  or  FPI,  which  can  significantly  increase  our  risk  of  a  potential  negative  profit adjustment, as development contracts by nature involve elements that have not been undertaken before and, thus, are highly subject to  future  unexpected cost growth. In addition, other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production, which includes starting and stabilizing a manufacturing and test line while the final design is still being validated. Moreover, over the past several years, the DoD has increased its use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracts, under which it awards certain prototypes, research and production contracts without all of the procurement requirements that typically apply to DoD contracts, including justification of sole source awards. OTAs may use fixed-price contracts during all phases of the contract, or mandated contract  cost  sharing  (e.g.,  one-third  of  program  costs).  They  may  also  require  non-traditional  subcontractor  participation  and impose other requirements that differ from our other DoD contracts. Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to perform on our OTA contracts, including any applicable non-traditional requirements. Moreover, from time to time, we may begin performance under an undefinitized contract action with a not-to-exceed price prior to completing contract negotiations in order to support U.S. government priorities. Uncertainties in final contract price, specifications and terms, or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization, may negatively affect our profitability. In addition, as discussed more fully below, our U.S. government contracts also require us to comply with extensive and evolving procurement rules and regulations and subject us to potential U.S. government audits, investigations, and disputes. We are also involved in programs that are classified by the U.S.",

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

      "question": "How did Boeing's increased reliance on fixed-price contracts in 2022 contribute to the $1,585 million in losses on major defense programs in 2023, and what role did cost overruns play in this financial deterioration?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing faced growing financial pressure due to its reliance on fixed-price contracts, particularly in its defense segment, which exposed the company to cost overruns and delivery delays. By 2023, this risk materialized as Boeing recorded $1,585 million in additional losses on its five most significant fixed-price defense programs, including the KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. These losses were directly tied to production disruptions, supplier instability, and technical challenges\u2014common causes of cost overruns in fixed-price contracts. The company's inability to fully offset these increased costs in fixed-price agreements led to significant financial deterioration, demonstrating how the structure of contracts in 2022 directly influenced 2023 performance through the risk factor of cost overruns.",

Cash flows continue  to  be  negatively  impacted  by  delayed  payments  from  customers,  higher  costs  and  inventory  levels,  and payments made to customers in connection with disruption to their operations. In addition, we have experienced claims and  assertions  from  customers  in  connection  with  the  grounding  and  associated  delivery  delays,  and  recorded  an estimate  of  potential  concessions  and  other  considerations  to  customers  for  these  disruptions. As  of  December  31, 2021, the remaining liability associated with these concessions and other considerations totaled $2.9 billion, of which $0.7 billion remains subject to negotiation.\n\nAny further delays in regulatory approval of the 737 MAX in one or more jurisdictions, further disruptions to suppliers and/or  the  long-term  health  of  the  production  system,  supplier  claims  or  assertions,  or  changes  to  estimated concessions or other considerations we expect to provide to customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. In the event of unanticipated additional training requirements in one or more jurisdictions, delays in regulatory approval and/or delays in our ability to resume deliveries to one or more  customers,  we  may  be  required  to  take  actions  with  longer-term  impact,  such  as  further  changes  to  our production plans, employment reductions and/or the expenditure of significant resources to support our supply chain and/or customers.\n\nWe have made significant estimates with respect to the 737 program regarding the number of units to be produced, the period  during  which  those  units  are  likely  to  be  produced,  and  the  units'  expected  sales  prices,  production  costs, program  tooling  and  other  non-recurring  costs,  and  routine  warranty  costs.  We  have  made  assumptions  regarding outcomes of accident investigations and other government inquiries, timing of future 737 production rate increases, timing  and  sequence  of  future  deliveries,  supply  chain  health  as  we  implement  our  production  plans,  as  well  as outcomes of negotiations with customers. Any changes in these estimates and/or assumptions with respect to the 737 program could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\n## In  addition  to  the  impact  of  COVID-19  described  above,  our  Commercial  Airplanes  and  Global  Services businesses depend heavily on commercial airlines, and are subject to unique risks.\n\nMarket  conditions  have  a  significant  impact  on  demand  for  our  commercial  aircraft  and  related  services. The commercial  aircraft  market  is  predominantly  driven  by  long-term  trends  in  airline  passenger  and  cargo  traffic.  The principal  factors  underlying  long-term  traffic  growth  are  sustained  economic  growth  and  political  stability  both  in developed  and  emerging  markets.  Demand  for  our  commercial  aircraft  is  further  influenced  by  airline  profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological advances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower  revenues,  profitability  and  cash  flows  and  a  reduction  in  our  contractual  backlog.  In  addition,  because  our commercial  aircraft  backlog  consists  of  aircraft  scheduled  for  delivery  over  a  period  of  several  years,  any  of  these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\n\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations  between  the  contract  date  and  delivery  date,  aircraft  pricing  generally  consists  of  a  fixed  amount  as modified by price escalation formulas",

By 2024, the notional value of these hedges had increased from $8.3 billion to $9.9 billion, indicating a strategic expansion in hedging activity.

REITS are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which it is traded.\n\nAbsolute return consists of private partnership interests in hedge funds, insurance contracts, derivative instruments, hedge fund of funds, and other alternative investments. Insurance consists of insurance contracts, which are valued using cash surrender values which is the amount the plan would receive if the contract was cashed out at year end. Derivative instruments consist of various swaps and bond futures that are used to help manage risks.\n\nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include the net of interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased and interest payable.\n\nThe balances of and changes in the fair values of the international pension plans' level 3 assets consist primarily of insurance contracts under the absolute return asset class.

The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates.

The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively.

          "chunk_text": "REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG -TERM SERVICES AG REEMENTS. We enter into long-term services agreements with our customers, predominantly within the CES segment, that require us to maintain the customers' assets over the contract terms, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. Contract modifications that extend or revise contracts are not uncommon. We recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. This requires us to make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the current contract term as well as the costs to perform required maintenance services.\n\nOur rights to consideration for these arrangements are generally based on the utilization of the asset (e.g., per hour of usage) and contractual payment terms are based on either periodic billing schedules or upon the occurrence of a maintenance event, such as an overhaul. A s a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenue of a contract is estimating how customers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. The estimate of utilization, which can change over the contract life, impacts both the amount of customer payments we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract costs. Customers' asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhauls and other service events over the life of the contract. We generally use a combination of both historical utilization trends as well as forward-looking information such as market conditions and potential asset retirements in developing our revenue estimates.\n\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul events, including the frequency of maintenance events and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the maintenance. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.\n\nWe routinely review estimates and revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. Changes in estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis with an adjustment to revenue in the current period. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. Contract modifications that change the rights and obligations, as well as the nature, timing and extent of future cash flows, are evaluated for potential price concessions, contract asset impairments and significant financing to determine if adjustments of earnings are required before effectively accounting for a modified contract as a new contract.\n\nWe regularly assess expected billings adjustments and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and fleet management strategies through close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions may affect a long-term services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings.\n\nOn December 31, 2024, our long-term service agreements net liability balance of $6.6 billion represents approximately 4.1% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $162 billion. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 18.4% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. Revisions to our estimates of future billings or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage point would increase or decrease the long-term service agreements balance by $0.4 billion. Billings collected on these contracts were $8.6 billion and $8.1 billion during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Notes 1 and 8 for further information.\n\nNONRECURRING ENGINEERING  COSTS. We incur contract fulfillment costs for engineering and development of products directly related to existing or anticipated contracts with customers, primarily in our Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies segment. Contract fulfillment costs are capitalized to the extent recoverable from the customer contract, and subsequently amortized as the products are delivered to the customer. We periodically assess the recoverability of capitalized contract fulfillment costs, which requires significant judgement. Specifically, we estimate program volumes, contract revenue based on negotiated prices, and product costs based on input costs, inflation and productivity. See Note 8 for further information.\n\nIMPAIRMENT OF G OODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIED INTANG IBLE ASSETS . Goodwill is subject to annual, or more frequent, if necessary, impairment testing. In the impairment test, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions, or a market approach, when available and appropriate, utilizing market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, or both. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, and changes to those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analyses on key estimates and assumptions. Once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired. In the fourth quarter of each y ear, we perform our annual impairment test. See Note 7 for further information.\n\nWe review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. To determine fair value, we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate. See Notes 1 and 7 for further information.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 17",

      "question": "How did FedEx's exposure to service commitments risk evolve from 2022 to 2024 in relation to its changing relationship with the USPS, particularly considering the September 2024 contract expiration and the emergence of USPS as a competitive threat?",
      "answer": "In 2022, FedEx disclosed significant risk tied to service commitments, noting that the USPS, its largest customer, was strategically reducing reliance on FedEx Express's air network, which had already negatively impacted results of operations that year. The company faced a $230 million reserve fluctuation risk due to self-insurance accrual sensitivity, compounding the exposure from potential service disruptions tied to contractual obligations. By 2024, the relationship had evolved further: the USPS contract was set to expire in September 2024, and FedEx now explicitly identified USPS as a competitor, signaling a strategic shift. This transition from a major customer to a competitive threat increased FedEx\u2019s exposure, as failure to renew the contract would not only reduce revenue but also intensify competitive pressure in domestic delivery markets. The evolution of this relationship reflects a dual shift: from dependency to risk diversification in service commitments and from customer to rival in competitive positioning.",

Our business is capital intensive, with approximately 55% of our owned assets invested in our transportation and information system infrastructures.\n\nThe depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any salvage values, requires management to make judgments about future events. Because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods (the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated over 15 to 30 years), we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset. These evaluations consider usage, maintenance costs, and economic factors that affect the useful life of an asset. This evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment.\n\nFor our aircraft, we consider actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and future volume projections in estimating the useful lives and expected salvage values. We typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of our aircraft in cargo configuration, which results in little to no value at the end of their useful life. These estimates affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. Changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods and could have a material impact on our results of operations (as described below). Historically, gains and losses on disposals of operating equipment have not been material. However, such amounts may differ materially in the future due to changes in business levels, technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory changes, and other factors beyond our control.\n\nIMPAIRMENT. As of May 31, 2022, the FedEx Express global air network included a fleet of 696 aircraft (including approximately 300 supplemental aircraft) that provide delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through a wide range of U.S. and international shipping services. While certain aircraft are utilized in primary geographic areas (U.S. versus international), we operate an integrated global network, and utilize our aircraft and other modes of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitments to our customers. Because of the integrated nature of our global network, our aircraft are interchangeable across routes and geographies, giving us flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic conditions and maintain and modify aircraft as needed.",

As technology, customer behavior, and market conditions continue to evolve, it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and service offerings to our customers. If we are not able to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences, our future financial results will suffer. For additional discussion, see 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report under the caption 'Strategy.'\n\nWe may not be able to achieve our fiscal 2025 financial performance goals. In June 2022, we announced that FedEx is targeting certain financial performance goals for fiscal 2025. Our ability to achieve these goals is dependent on a number of factors, including the other risk factors described in this section. If we are not able to achieve these goals, the price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\n\nWe depend on our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand. The FedEx brand name symbolizes high-quality service, reliability, and speed. FedEx is one of the most widely recognized, trusted, and respected brands in the world, and the FedEx brand is one of our most important and valuable assets. In addition, we have a strong reputation among customers, team members, and the general public for high standards of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethics. The FedEx brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sales and marketing and recruitment tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our team members or others with whom we do business, such as customer service mishaps, accidents, catastrophes, or incidents involving aircraft, vehicles, or facilities operated by us; low service or safety levels; data breaches or technology infrastructure disruptions; noncompliance with laws; the shipment of certain items pursuant to our obligation as a common carrier operating under federal law; our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, or marketing programs; or our executive compensation practices could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. With the increase in the use of social media outlets such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly without context, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. Further, our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation with certain groups, including our customers and team members. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and/or create difficulties in retaining and recruiting employee talent, and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.\n\nChanges in the business or financial soundness of the USPS, including strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air network of FedEx Express, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The USPS is the largest customer of FedEx Express, which provides domestic air transportation services for the USPS's First Class Mail, Priority Mail Express, and Priority Mail and transportation and delivery for the USPS's international delivery service. See 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report under 'FedEx Express Segment' for more information.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the USPS. Additionally, the USPS continues to experience budgetary uncertainty as well as increased political debate regarding potential privatization or restructuring of its operations. The USPS is currently implementing strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air networks of FedEx Express and other transportation providers, which negatively impacted our results of operations in 2022. The difficulties discussed above or additional changes in the USPS's business, including its ability to access capital or any structural changes to its operations, network, volume levels, service offerings, service commitments, or pricing, could have additional negative impacts on our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, a decision by the USPS to terminate early or not renew its contract with FedEx Express for domestic services, which expires in September 2024, would negatively impact our profitability.\n\nWe face intense competition. The transportation and business services markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. Some of our competitors have more financial resources and competitive advantages than we do, appear willing to operate at little or no margin to gain market share, or they are owned, controlled, or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to raise capital more easily. We also compete with regional transportation providers that operate smaller and less capital-intensive transportation networks and startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, which could in turn reduce our revenues and market share. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. See 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report for additional information.",

Risk Factors' of this Annual Report, the U.S. domestic and international package and the U.S. domestic freight and international freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. The ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency, reliability, capacity and speed of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, innovative service offerings, and the fit within the customer's overall supply chain.\n\nCompetitors within the U.S. include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. ('UPS'), passenger airlines offering express package services, regional delivery companies, air freight forwarders, and the USPS. Federal Express's principal international competitors are DHL, UPS, DPD (a subsidiary of France's La Poste's GeoPost), General Logistics Systems (a Royal Mail-owned parcel delivery group), foreign postal authorities, passenger airlines, air freight forwarders, regional carriers, and all-cargo airlines. Federal Ex press also competes with startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers, such as Amazon.com, are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors and delivery service providers for deliveries, and may be considered competitors. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. Many of Federal Ex press's international competitors are government-owned, -controlled, or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity, and more favorable operating conditions than Federal Express. For more information, see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Employees and Service Providers\n\nRajesh Subramaniam is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Federal Express, John A. Smith is the Chief Operating Officer - United States and Canada, and Richard W. Smith is the Chief Operating Officer - International and Chief Executive Officer - Airline. As of June 7, 2024, Federal Ex press employed approximately 241,000 permanent full-time and approximately 189,000 permanent part-time employees. In addition, Federal Express contracts with approximately 6,000 independent small businesses to conduct certain linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations.\n\nThe pilots at Federal Express, who are a small number of its total employees, are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International ('ALPA') and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement that took effect in November 2015. The collective bargaining agreement became amendable in November 2021. Bargaining for a successor agreement began in May 2021, and in",

      "question": "How did General Dynamics' allocation to equity funds change between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of assets measured using NAV as a practical expedient, and what does this indicate about their pension asset strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, General Dynamics reported $354 million in equity funds under commingled funds, all measured using NAV as a practical expedient. By 2023, the total fair value of commingled equity funds increased significantly to $4,429 million, but only $38 million of this amount was measured using NAV as a practical expedient. This indicates a major shift in how equity fund investments are valued, with a growing portion now categorized under more transparent Level 1 and Level 2 inputs. The strategy suggests a move toward greater valuation transparency and potentially lower estimation risk in pension asset reporting.",

      "question": "How did the change in the number of UPS Class A common stock shares issued between 2022 (127 shares) and 2024 (121 shares) affect the relative voting power dynamics between Class A and Class B common stock, given the fixed voting structure where Class B shares hold 33 1/3% of combined voting power?",
      "answer": "The number of UPS Class A common stock shares issued decreased from 127 in 2022 to 121 in 2024, a reduction of 6 shares. This change occurred alongside a slight increase in Class B common stock shares issued, rising from 726 in 2023 to 733 in 2024. Given the fixed voting structure where Class B shares collectively hold 33 1/3% of combined voting power and Class A shares hold the remaining 66 2/3%, the reduction in Class A shares slightly increased the relative concentration of voting power among remaining Class A shareholders, while the overall non-dilutable 33 1/3% voting control of Class B shares remained unchanged.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS(2022) \u2192 Class A Common Stock: UPS had 127 Class A common stock shares issued in 2022, which are subject to specific vesting and exercise rules for stock options.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Class A and Class B shares have a defined voting power relationship where Class A holds 66 2/3% and Class B holds 33 1/3% of combined voting power, with Class B voting percentage being non-dilutable.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 UPS(2024): By 2024, UPS had 121 Class A shares and 733 Class B shares issued, showing a slight reduction in Class A shares and a small increase in Class B shares compared to 2023 figures."

Stock options granted in connection with the UPS Incentive Compensation Plan must have an exercise price at least equal to the NYSE closing price of UPS class B common stock on the date the option is granted.\n\nWe grant non-qualified stock options to a limited group of eligible senior management employees annually, in which the value granted is determined as a percentage of salary. Stock option awards vest over a five-year period with approximately 20% of the award vesting at each anniversary of the grant date (except in the case of death, disability or retirement, in which case immediate vesting occurs). The option grants expire 10 years after the date of the grant. Option holders may exercise their options via the payment of cash or class A common stock and new class A shares are issued upon exercise.\n\nThe following is an analysis of options to purchase shares of class A common stock issued and outstanding:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, GE disclosed it reinsured approximately 27,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 54, primarily underwritten on impaired lives, carrying a projected payment duration extending decades into the future. These contracts exposed GE to mortality and reinvestment risk, with statutory reserves reflecting an estimated remaining statutory increase of $3.6 billion through 2023. By 2024, UFLIC, which had been closed to new business since 2004, continued to hold structured settlement annuities inherited from Genworth Financial Inc., forming part of GE\u2019s run-off insurance operations. The persistence of these long-duration liabilities through UFLIC indicates that GE\u2019s exposure to longevity risk remained significant, despite no new business being added. The continuation of these contracts through UFLIC suggests that GE\u2019s risk exposure had transitioned from direct management of the annuities to managing legacy liabilities within a run-off structure, potentially limiting new risk intake but maintaining long-term financial obligations tied to life expectancy assumptions.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(a)    Statutory balances reflect recognition of the estimated remaining statutory increase in reserves of approximately $3.6 billion through 2023 under the permitted accounting practice discussed further below and in Note 11 .\n\nStructured settlement annuities and life insurance contracts. We reinsure approximately 27,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 54. These structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-thanaverage life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins). Unlike long- term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nOur life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. As of December 31, 2021, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance blocks, we reinsure approximately $70 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.7 million policies with an average attained age of 60. In 2021, our incurred claims were approximately $0.6 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $50,000. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20 and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20-year level term policies, which represent approximately 25% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2024 as the policies reach the end of their 20-year level premium period.\n\nInvestment portfolio and other adjustments. Our insurance liabilities and annuity benefits are primarily supported by investment securities of $41.6 billion and $42.0 billion and commercial mortgage loans of $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, we expect to purchase approximately $5.5 billion of new assets through 2024 in conjunction with expected capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2022, pending completion of our December 31, 2021 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. Our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and comprise mainly investment-grade debt securities. The portfolio includes $6.7 billion of net unrealized gains that are recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of applicable taxes and other adjustments as of December 31, 2021.\n\nIn calculating our future policy benefit reserves, we are required to consider the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investment securities supporting our insurance contracts as if those unrealized amounts were realized. To the extent that the realization of gains would result in a premium deficiency, an adjustment is recorded to increase future policy benefit reserves with an after-tax offset to Accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2021, $3.4 billion of net unrealized gains on our investment securities required a related increase to future policy benefit reserves. This adjustment decreased from $8.2 billion in 2020 to $3.4 billion in 2021 primarily from the higher margin resulting from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities. See Note 3 for further information about our investment securities.\n\nWe manage the investments in our run-off insurance operations under strict investment guidelines, including limitations on asset class concentration, single issuer exposures, asset-liability duration variances, and other factors to meet credit quality, yield, liquidity and diversification requirements associated with servicing our insurance liabilities under reasonable circumstances. This process includes consideration of various asset allocation strategies and incorporates information from several external investment advisors to improve our investment yield subject to maintaining our ability to satisfy insurance liabilities when due, as well as considering our risk-based capital requirements, regulatory constraints, and tolerance for surplus volatility. With the expected capital contributions through 2024, we intend to further diversify our portfolio, including with non-traditional asset classes such as private equity, senior secured loans and infrastructure debt, among others. Asset allocation planning is a dynamic process that considers changes in market conditions, risk appetite, liquidity needs and other factors which are reviewed on a periodic basis by our investment team. Investing in these assets exposes us to both credit risk (i.e., debtor's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest), interest rate risk (i.e., market price, cash flow variability, and reinvestment risk due to changes in market interest rates) and equity risk (i.e., the risk arising from",

See Notes 1 and 12 for further information.\n\nPENSION ASSUMPTIONS. Refer to Note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nINCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017, substantially all of our unrepatriated net earnings have been subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without significant additional tax cost. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. M ost of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which rely on reasonable estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. A mounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of this, an insignificant amount and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our GE V ernova, GE HealthCare and legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information - Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and 15 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental, health and safety matters, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, government contracts, employee benefit plans, product quality guarantees and losses resulting from other events and developments. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace products is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these products may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. M oreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\n## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumed long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumed long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc. (Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits.

This shift suggests a relative increase in the proportion of Class B shares, which have limited voting rights compared to Class A shares. According to the 2024 filing, Class A common stockholders have the right to vote on all matters, while Class B common stockholders have no voting rights except for certain defined matters, such as decisions to exit the core payments business or certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation. This change in equity structure could potentially reduce the overall voting power of shareholders, as Class B shares dominate the equity structure.

      "answer": "In 2023, UPS satisfied the FIP requirements for the Alaska Teamster-Employer Pension Plan, which was in the red zone, contributing $10 million. By 2024, despite the plan remaining in the red zone and FIP requirements still being in place, UPS increased its contribution to $11 million. This suggests that UPS's ongoing compliance with FIP obligations under the red zone classification led to a modest increase in contributions year-over-year, reflecting either a tightening of the FIP terms or a strategic decision to support the plan's financial recovery.",

      "answer": "The voting rights structure remained unchanged between 2023 and 2024, with Class A shares maintaining 10 votes per share and Class B shares retaining 1 vote per share. This continuity indicates that UPS preserved its governance control framework, ensuring that long-term stakeholders\u2014primarily employees, retirees, and founder-related trusts\u2014retain significant influence over corporate decisions.

Despite these changes, the par value for both classes remained constant at $2 for Class A and $7 for Class B in both years. The voting rights associated with these shares, where Class B shares typically carry more voting power, remained unchanged. However, the additional paid-in capital increased from $0 in 2023 to $136 million in 2024, indicating a potential shift in the capital structure that could influence shareholder influence despite the stable par value and voting rights.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MMM adopted ASU 2020-04, which provided optional expedients for contract modifications and hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform, and they noted that the adoption would not have a material impact on their consolidated results. In 2023, MMM disclosed that derivative gains or losses recorded in income for hedging relationships included $15 million for interest rate contracts related to fair value hedging relationships, compared to $94 million in 2022. This indicates a significant decrease in the impact of fair value hedging relationships on income, potentially reflecting the application of ASU 2020-04 in managing the transition away from LIBOR and reducing financial volatility.",

New optional expedients allow derivative instruments impacted by changes in the interest rate used for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment to qualify for certain optional relief. The amendments in ASU 2022-06 extend the sunset date of the reference rate reform optional expedients and exceptions to December 31, 2024. | Effective for contract modifications made between March 12, 2020 and December 31, 2024. | The guidance has reduced the operational and financial impacts of contract modifications that replace a reference rate, such as London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR'), affected by reference rate reform.

      "question": "How did the conversion of Class B shares into Class A shares at UPS affect the equity structure changes between 2023 and 2024, particularly regarding shares issued and additional paid-in capital?",
      "answer": "In 2023, UPS disclosed that 726 shares of Class B common stock were issued, while 127 shares of Class A common stock were issued. According to the CMCSA filing, Class B shares are convertible on a share-for-share basis into Class A shares, subject to certain restrictions. By 2024, UPS reported a decrease in Class A shares issued (from 127 to 121) and an increase in Class B shares issued (from 726 to 733). Notably, additional paid-in capital appeared for the first time in 2024 at $136 million. This suggests that some Class B shares were converted into Class A shares during the year, introducing paid-in capital into the equity structure as a result of the conversion mechanism, which allows Class B shares to convert to Class A shares under specific conditions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS(2023) \u2192 Class B Common Stock: UPS disclosed 726 Class B shares issued in 2023, unchanged from 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Class B shares are convertible share-for-share into Class A shares, as described in the CMCSA filing.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 UPS(2024): By 2024, UPS reported 121 Class A shares issued (down from 127 in 2023) and 733 Class B shares issued (up from 726 in 2023), with $136 million in additional paid-in capital appearing for the first time."

      "question": "How did GE's exposure to structured settlement annuity risks evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what implications did UFLIC's underwriting profile have on the company's long-term liability management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GE's exposure to structured settlement annuities was managed through UFLIC, which reinsured these contracts and carried risks related to mortality, longevity, and reinvestment in a low-interest-rate environment. UFLIC had underwritten approximately 27% of these annuities on 'impaired lives,' indicating shorter-than-average life expectancies, which directly influenced the projected payment durations and liabilities. By 2024, GE continued to reinsure around 23,400 structured settlement annuities, maintaining the same 27% impaired lives percentage, but the average attained age of policyholders had risen to 57, suggesting a progression in the maturity of the portfolio. The lack of ability to adjust premiums or reduce benefits on these contracts meant that GE had to rely on actuarial assumptions and reserve adequacy to manage long-term liability risks. The continuation of this underwriting profile from 2023 to 2024 highlights GE's ongoing dependency on accurate mortality projections and the importance of maintaining sufficient reserves amid potential longevity improvements.",

        "Hop 1: GE(2023) \u2192 UFLIC: GE's 2023 filing notes UFLIC's role in reinsuring structured settlement annuities and highlights solvency concerns that could adversely affect UFLIC's operations.",
        "Hop 2: UFLIC \u2192 Structured Settlement Annuities: UFLIC produced structured settlement annuities as part of its closed reinsurance business, with 27% underwritten on impaired lives.",
        "Hop 3: Structured Settlement Annuities \u2190 GE(2024): By 2024, GE continued to reinsure approximately 23,400 structured settlement annuities, maintaining exposure to mortality and reinvestment risks with no ability to adjust premiums or benefits."

          "chunk_text": "\n(a)    Pending completion of our December 31, 2024 statutory reporting process.\n\nStructured settlement annuities. We reinsure approximately 23,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 57. A pproximately 27% of these structured settlement annuities were underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than-average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment). Unlike long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nLife Insurance contracts. Our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. A t December 31, 2024, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance portfolio, we reinsure approximately $45 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.1 million policies with an average attained age of 63. In 2024, our incurred claims were approximately $0.4 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $46,100. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20- and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20- and 30-year level term policies, which represent approximately 7% and 43% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2026 and 2035 as the policies reach the end of their 20- and 30-year level premium period, respectively.\n\nCritical Accounting E stimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums and are estimated based on actuarial assumptions such as mortality, morbidity, terminations, and expenses. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings. Our annual review procedures include updating certain experience studies since our last completed review, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. The review of experience and assumptions is a comprehensive and complex process that depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. The review relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance portfolio includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.",

      "answer": "In 2022, UNP's Receivables Facility was impacted by credit risks, particularly default and dilution ratios, which influenced the allowable outstanding amount under the facility. Despite these risks, the facility was utilized to the extent of $300 million at the end of 2021. By 2024, the facility was not drawn upon, with $0 outstanding at year-end, although the Railroad issued and repaid the full $800 million during the year. The amount of accounts receivable pledged as collateral increased from $1.3 billion in 2021 to $1.6 billion in 2024, indicating a stronger collateral base. Meanwhile, the cost of the facility decreased slightly from $10 million in 2022 to $8 million in 2024, suggesting improved efficiency or favorable financing terms despite the ongoing sensitivity to credit risk metrics.",

The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of $320 million for national security space programs due to lower volume on classified programs and $145 million for commercial civil space due to lower volume on the Orion program, partially offset by higher volume on other space exploration programs. These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of $255 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume on FBM and reentry programs.\n\nSpace's operating profit in 2024 increased $68 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to $100 million related to favorable contract mix and cost recoveries across the portfolio, partially offset by $55 million of lower profit booking rate adjustments due to lower net favorable profit rate adjustments on the Orion program and $25 million of higher equity earnings driven by higher launch volume from our investment in ULA.\n\n## Equity earnings\n\nTotal equity earnings (attributable to our investment in ULA) represented approximately $45 million and $20 million, or 4% and 2%, of Space's operating profit during 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Backlog\n\nBacklog increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher orders for National Security Space for classified programs, Commercial Civil Space for G eoXO program, and Strategic and Missiles Defense for FBM Mk7 program.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, AspenTech's stock-based compensation plans included only stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs), with RSUs generally vesting over four years. By fiscal 2023, Emerson introduced performance stock units (PSUs) in addition to stock options and RSUs, with both RSUs and PSUs generally vesting over three years. The vesting conditions became more performance-linked in 2023, with PSUs tied to predefined goals based on annual contract value and free cash flows. ASC 805 required Emerson to allocate the fair value of these awards between pre- and post-combination service periods, with the post-combination portion recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining service period. This evolution in compensation structure increased the complexity and forward-looking nature of Emerson\u2019s financial reporting obligations related to AspenTech post-acquisition.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## AspenTech Stock-Based Compensation\n\nAs discussed in Note 4, Emerson completed the acquisition of Heritage AspenTech in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. AspenTech, as defined in Note 4, operates as a separate publicly traded company and has various stock-based compensation plans, including stock options and restricted stock units, which are settled in their own common stock and are accounted for as equity awards. Restricted stock units generally vest over four years. Option awards have been granted with an exercise price equal to the market closing price of AspenTech's stock on the trading day prior to the grant date. These options generally vest over 4 years and expire within 7 years or 10 years of grant. AspenTech's policy is to issue new shares upon the exercise of vested stock awards.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement between Emerson and Heritage AspenTech, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock, whether vested or unvested, that was unexercised as of immediately prior to the closing date was converted into an option to acquire shares of AspenTech. Each converted option is subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original option. In addition, each outstanding award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock that were unvested as of immediately prior to the closing date was converted into an award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of AspenTech. Each converted restricted stock unit is also subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original restricted stock unit.\n\nASC 805 required the Company to determine the fair value of the AspenTech share-based payment awards related to the replacement of the Heritage AspenTech share-based payment awards, and allocate the total fair value based on the services that are attributable to the pre- and post-combination service periods, respectively. The portion that is attributable to the pre-combination service period was considered part of the consideration transferred for Heritage AspenTech and included as part of the purchase price. The portion that is attributable to the post-combination service period is recognized as stock-based compensation expense in the post-combination consolidated financial statements over the remaining requisite service period.\n\n## AspenTech Stock Options\n\nAspenTech utilizes the Black-Scholes option valuation model for estimating the fair value of options granted. The BlackScholes option valuation model incorporates assumptions regarding expected stock price volatility, the expected life of the option, the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield and the market value of AspenTech's common stock. The expected stock price volatility is determined based on AspenTech's stock's historic prices over a period commensurate with the expected life of the award. The expected life of an option represents the period for which options are expected to be outstanding as determined by historic option exercises and cancellations. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for notes with terms approximating the expected life of the options granted. The expected dividend yield is zero, based on AspenTech's history and expectation of not paying dividends on common shares. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of forfeitures as they occur, over the requisite service period for time-vested awards.",

      "question": "How did the change in noncontrolling interest valuation for Heritage AspenTech between 2022 and 2023 reflect the evolution of EMR's ownership structure and financial impact following the acquisition method accounting?",
      "answer": "In 2022, EMR recorded a noncontrolling interest of $5.9 billion for the 45% ownership stake of former Heritage AspenTech stockholders in the newly formed AspenTech, using the closing market price per share of Heritage AspenTech as of May 16, 2022. This valuation was based on the fair value of the noncontrolling interest at the time of the transaction. By 2023, the cash contribution of $6.0 billion from EMR had been distributed to Heritage AspenTech stockholders at approximately $87.69 per share (on a fully diluted basis), leaving only $168 million in cash on AspenTech\u2019s balance sheet post-closing. This indicates a concrete financial outflow that aligned with the earlier fair value estimate, validating the initial noncontrolling interest valuation and showing how EMR\u2019s ownership structure transitioned from a 55% controlling stake to a more defined equity and cash-based transaction settlement, with implications for long-term consolidation and financial reporting.",

Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson beneficially owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis) and former Heritage AspenTech stockholders owned the remaining outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock. AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech's previous name 'Aspen Technology, Inc.' and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under AspenTech's previous stock ticker symbol 'AZPN.'\n\nThe business combination has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with Emerson considered the accounting acquirer of Heritage AspenTech. The net assets of Heritage AspenTech were recorded at their estimated fair value and the Emerson Industrial Software Business continues at its historical basis. The Company recorded a noncontrolling interest of $5.9 billion for the 45 percent ownership interest of former Heritage AspenTech stockholders in AspenTech.

      "answer": "In 2022, GD deferred $305 million in environmental compliance costs under U.S. government contracts that were not yet allocable under FAR and CAS guidelines, expecting recovery through existing backlog and follow-on contracts. By 2023, GD noted that environmental compliance costs were increasingly recoverable under U.S. Government Contracts, with no expectation of material impact on financials due to U.S. government cost recovery policies. This suggests a strategic shift toward more effective cost recovery mechanisms and improved alignment of deferred costs with contract funding streams, indicating a more confident posture in managing long-term contract cost exposure.",

          "chunk_text": "\nSee Note K for information regarding our debt obligations, including interest rates.\n\nCash and Equivalents and Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We  consider  securities  with  a maturity  of  three  months  or  less  to  be  cash  equivalents.  Our  cash  balances  are  invested  primarily  in  time deposits rated A-/A3 or higher. Our investments in other securities are included in other current and noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We report our equity securities at fair value with subsequent changes in  fair  value  recognized  in  net  earnings.  We  report  our  available-for-sale  debt  securities  at  fair  value  with unrealized  gains  and  losses  recognized  as  a  component  of  other  comprehensive  income  in  the  Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. We had no trading or held-to-maturity debt securities on December 31, 2021 or 2020. See Note P for additional information regarding our investments in debt and equity securities.\n\nOther Contract Costs. Other contract costs represent amounts accrued under GAAP that are not currently allocable to U.S. government contracts in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). These costs include workers' compensation, pension and other post-retirement benefits,  and  environmental  obligations.  We  defer  these  costs  in  other  current  assets  on  the  Consolidated Balance  Sheet  until  they  can  be  allocated  to  contracts,  which  is  generally  after  they  are  paid.  We  expect  to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. We regularly  assess  the  probability  of  recovery  of  these  costs.  If  the  backlog  in  the  future  does  not  support  the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Other contract costs on December 31, 2021 and 2020, were $305 and $499, respectively.\n\nAcquisitions  and  Divestitures. In  the  last  three  years,  we  acquired  six  businesses  in  our  Aerospace segment,  two  businesses  in  our  Combat  Systems  segment  and  a  business  in  our  Technologies  segment.  The operating results of these acquisitions have been included with our reported results since the respective closing dates. The purchase prices of the acquisitions have been allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill.\n\nIn  2020,  we  completed  the  sale  of  a  business  in  our  Aerospace  segment  and  two  businesses  in  our Technologies  segment,  one  of  which  was  classified  as  held  for  sale  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  on December  31,  2019.  In  2019,  we  completed  the  sale  of  a  business  in  our  Technologies  segment  that  was classified as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on December 31, 2018.\n\nLong-lived  Assets  and  Goodwill. We  review  long-lived  assets,  including  intangible  assets  subject  to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows. Impairment losses, where identified, are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived assets over the estimated fair value as determined by discounted cash flows.",

We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.\n\n## REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate.

      "answer": "In 2023, Caterpillar reported 28 EIP Plans with approximately 14,000 active participants, resulting in the purchase of 78,000 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter. By 2024, the number of EIP Plans increased to 38, with 16,000 active participants, but the total shares purchased dropped to 57,000 in the fourth quarter. This indicates that while Caterpillar expanded its global employee equity footprint by increasing both the number of plans and participants, the volume of stock purchased under these plans decreased, suggesting a potential shift in employee participation behavior or a recalibration of the plan's contribution structure.",

However, in 2024, Emerson noted that its own stock option plans had expired in 2021 and no new grants were made in recent years. This expiration likely shifted focus to AspenTech's standalone stock-based compensation framework, where converted options remained subject to AspenTech's vesting rules and expiration timelines.

          "chunk_text": "\n## AspenTech Stock-Based Compensation\n\nAs discussed in Note 4, Emerson completed the acquisition of Heritage AspenTech in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. AspenTech, as defined in Note 4, operates as a separate publicly traded company and has various stock-based compensation plans, including stock options and restricted stock units, which are settled in their own common stock and are accounted for as equity awards. Restricted stock units generally vest over four years. Option awards have been granted with an exercise price equal to the market closing price of AspenTech's stock on the trading day prior to the grant date. These options generally vest over 4 years and expire within 7 years or 10 years of grant. AspenTech's policy is to issue new shares upon the exercise of vested stock awards.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement between Emerson and Heritage AspenTech, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock, whether vested or unvested, that was unexercised as of immediately prior to the closing date was converted into an option to acquire shares of AspenTech. Each converted option is subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original option. In addition, each outstanding award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock that were unvested as of immediately prior to the closing date was converted into an award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of AspenTech. Each converted restricted stock unit is also subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original restricted stock unit.\n\nASC 805 required the Company to determine the fair value of the AspenTech share-based payment awards related to the replacement of the Heritage AspenTech share-based payment awards, and allocate the total fair value based on the services that are attributable to the pre- and post-combination service periods, respectively. The portion that is attributable to the pre-combination service period was considered part of the consideration transferred for Heritage AspenTech and included as part of the purchase price. The portion that is attributable to the post-combination service period is recognized as stock-based compensation expense in the post-combination consolidated financial statements over the remaining requisite service period.\n\n## AspenTech Stock Options\n\nAspenTech utilizes the Black-Scholes option valuation model for estimating the fair value of options granted. The BlackScholes option valuation model incorporates assumptions regarding expected stock price volatility, the expected life of the option, the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield and the market value of AspenTech's common stock. The expected stock price volatility is determined based on AspenTech's stock's historic prices over a period commensurate with the expected life of the award. The expected life of an option represents the period for which options are expected to be outstanding as determined by historic option exercises and cancellations. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for notes with terms approximating the expected life of the options granted. The expected dividend yield is zero, based on AspenTech's history and expectation of not paying dividends on common shares. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of forfeitures as they occur, over the requisite service period for time-vested awards.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MMM used foreign exchange option contracts to hedge forecasted transactions, with these derivatives impacting cash flow hedge accounting and deferring gains and losses in AOCI until the forecasted transactions occurred. By 2024, the notional amount of MMM's foreign exchange cash flow hedges had increased to $9.9 billion from $8.3 billion, indicating a higher level of hedging activity. This increase was reflected in AOCI, where net deferred gains on these contracts totaled $99 million as of the end of fiscal 2024. These gains will be reclassified into earnings as the hedged forecasted transactions occur. The growth in hedging notional and the corresponding rise in deferred gains in AOCI suggest a more active approach to managing foreign exchange risk on forecasted transactions over this period.",

Real estate consists of property funds and REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts). REITS are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which it is traded.\n\nAbsolute return consists of private partnership interests in hedge funds, insurance contracts, derivative instruments, hedge fund of funds, and other alternative investments. Insurance consists of insurance contracts, which are valued using cash surrender values which is the amount the plan would receive if the contract was cashed out at year end. Derivative instruments consist of various swaps and bond futures that are used to help manage risks.\n\nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include the net of interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased and interest payable.\n\nThe balances of and changes in the fair values of the international pension plans' level 3 assets consist primarily of insurance contracts under the absolute return asset class. In 2021 the aggregate of net purchases and net unrealized gains and losses decreased this balance by $7 million and the change in currency exchange rates decreased this balance by $44 million for a net decrease of $51 million. In 2020 the aggregate net purchases and net unrealized gains decreased this balance by $1 million and the change in currency exchange rates increased the balance by $44 million for a net increase to this balance of $43 million.\n\n## NOTE 14. Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3M's financial position and performance.\n\nAdditional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:\n\n- Impact on other comprehensive income of nonderivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 8.\n- Fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 15.\n- Derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company's long-term debt are also described in Note 12.\n\nRefer to the section below titled Statement of Income Location and Impact of Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments for details on the location within the consolidated statements of income for amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow or fair value hedges (along with similar information relative to the hedged items) and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Additional information relative to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included below as applicable.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges:\n\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts: The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income for de-designated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring.

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

Separately, the banks may have arrangements with the suppliers that provide them the option to request early payment from the banks for invoices confirmed by 3M. 3M's outstanding balances of confirmed invoices in the programs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively.

This includes a remaining balance of $80 million (after-tax loss) related to forward starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock contracts terminated in 2019 concurrent with associated debt issuances, which is being amortized over the respective lives of the underlying notes. Based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, of the total after-tax net unrealized balance as of December 31, 2024, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $44 million after-tax  net unrealized gain over the nex t 12 months (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).",

      "question": "How did the change in the number of outstanding shares of UPS Class B common stock between 2022 (725 shares) and 2023 (726 shares), combined with the non-dilutable 33 1/3% voting power structure and 15-vote weighting per share, affect the relative shareholder control dynamics compared to Class A common stock in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UPS had 725 shares of Class B common stock outstanding, and in 2023, this increased slightly to 726 shares. Class B shares maintain 15 votes per share and a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, as stated in the evidence. Mr. Brian L. Roberts owns all Class B shares, which means his control remains concentrated despite the slight increase in shares. Meanwhile, Class A common stockholders hold 66 2/3% of voting power collectively, with the number of issued shares decreasing from 134 in 2022 to 127 in 2023. This dynamic reinforces the concentrated control of Mr. Roberts through Class B shares, despite a minor increase in their count, due to their structural voting advantage over Class A shares.",

        "Hop 1: UPS(2022) \u2192 Class B Common Stock: UPS disclosed 725 issued Class B shares in 2022, with a fixed 33 1/3% voting power structure.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Class B shares have 15 votes per share and non-dilutable 33 1/3% voting power, while Class A shares collectively hold 66 2/3% of voting power.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 UPS(2023): In 2023, UPS disclosed 726 issued Class B shares and 127 issued Class A shares, showing a marginal increase in Class B shares but no change in the relative voting power distribution."

By 2024, the same number of shares remained authorized, but the continued convertibility of Class A shares into Class B shares could have affected the overall voting power distribution. The persistence of this structure suggests a stable framework for governance and public ownership, though the lack of preferred shares issued remained unchanged, preserving the dual-class equity structure.",

      "answer": "General Dynamics significantly increased its investment in Electric Boat's facilities between 2023 and 2024 to support growing demand for nuclear-powered submarines. In 2023, Electric Boat was already the prime contractor for all Navy nuclear-powered submarine programs, including the $115 billion Columbia-class program with delivery scheduled to begin in 2027. By 2024, the value of the Columbia-class program had increased to over $125 billion, with the first delivery now expected in 2028. This one-year delay in initial delivery, combined with the sustained pace of one Columbia-class and up to two Virginia-class submarines per year, indicates that GD's expanded facilities and workforce investments were critical to managing production complexity and scaling output. The company also expanded its supplier network to approximately 3,000 partners to support concurrent production of both submarine programs, showing a clear evolution in capacity and coordination needs from 2023 to 2024.",

W e also provide m aintenance, m odernization and lifecycle support services for Navy ships and m aintain the most sophisticated m arine engineering expertise in the world to support future capabilities. Our ability to design, build and m aintain our nation's most technologically sophisticated warships is a critical elem ent of the U.S. defense industrial base. In addition to Navy ships, we have designed and built ocean-going Jones Act ships for com m ercial custom ers. Marine System s consists of three business units - Electric Boat, Bath Iron W orks and NASSCO.\n\nIn support of our Navy customer's significant increase in dem and for subm arines and surface ships, we have m ade substantial investm ents to expand our facilities, grow and train our workforce, and expand our supply chain. The resulting increase in capacity and capabilities will support the unprecedented growth expected in our shipbuilding business, particularly subm arines, over the next two decades.\n\nElectric Boat is the prim e contractor and lead shipyard on all Navy nuclear-powered subm arine program s. The business is responsible for all aspects of design and engineering and leads the construction of both Colum bia-class ballistic-m issile subm arines and Virginia-class attack subm arines.\n\nThe  Columbia-class  ballistic-m issile  subm arine  is  a  12-boat  program   that  the  Navy  considers  its  top  acquisition  priority .  Accordingly ,  the program has received the highest possible rating from  the governm ent's Defense Priorities and Allocations System . These subm arines will provide strategic deterrent capabilities for decades, with the first boat expected to deliver in 2028 to begin replacem ent of the current Ohio-class ballisticmissile subm arine fleet as it reaches the end of its service life. Construction is scheduled to span two decades, and the value of the Navy's program  of record is in excess of $125 billion.\n\nThe Navy procures Virginia-class subm arines in m ulti-boat blocks.

Equal to the com m itm ent of capital is our com m itm ent to developing our Electric Boat workforce. While the steepest portion of our personnel ram p is behind us, we still expect the Electric Boat workforce to continue to grow to enable sustained production of one Colum biaclass subm arine plus up to two Virginia-class subm arines per year as the subm arine industrial base expands to support that pace. Along with strong contributions from  the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island, we continue to invest in the training and tools necessary for our skilled em ployees to deliver these next-generation subm arines to the Navy . W e continue to work with our growing network of approxim ately 3,000 suppliers to support the growth related to concurrent production of the two subm arine program s.\n\nBath Iron Works builds the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) guided-missile destroyer and m anages m odernization and lifecycle support for all Navy destroyers.

      "question": "How did the valuation methodology for UPS's Level 1 assets in 2022 compare to the NAV disclosures for alternative investments in 2023, and what does this reveal about the evolution of UPS's pension asset valuation practices?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UPS disclosed that Level 1 assets, including equity investments and U.S. government securities, were valued using closing prices or the mean of bid-ask spreads, while alternative investments like hedge funds and private equity were valued using NAV as a practical expedient due to the lack of readily determinable fair values. By 2023, UPS continued to use NAV for valuing alternative investments, but auditors noted increased subjectivity in estimating NAV for these assets, particularly for hedge funds and real estate, requiring significant auditor judgment. This indicates a growing complexity and reliance on unobservable inputs in the valuation of alternative investments, even as Level 1 asset valuations remained grounded in observable market data.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS(2022) \u2192 Level 1 Assets: UPS disclosed that Level 1 assets were valued using quoted prices or bid-ask spreads, including equities and U.S. government securities.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 2020 - $10.1 billion pre-tax actuarial loss related to benefit obligation:\n\n- Discount Rates ($7.3 billion pre-tax loss): The weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from 3.55% as of December 31, 2019 to 2.87% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decline in U.S. treasury yields that was slightly offset by an increase in credit spreads on AA-rated corporate bonds.\n- Coordinating benefits attributable to the Central States Pension Fund ($2.3 billion pre-tax loss): This represents our current best estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the Central States Pension Fund before taking into account the impact of the change in discount rates.\n- Demographic and Assumption Changes ($513 million pre-tax loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation changes, rates of termination, retirement, mortality and other changes.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Plan Assets\n\nPension assets are invested in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as investment guidelines established by plan trustees. The strategic asset mixes are specifically tailored for each plan given distinct factors, including liability and liquidity needs. Equities, alternative investments, and other higher yielding assets are utilized to generate returns and promote growth. Derivatives, repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements and fixed income securities are utilized as tools for duration management, mitigating interest rate risk, and minimizing funded status volatility.\n\nThe primary long-term investment objectives for pension assets are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital to meet future obligations while minimizing risk exposures and reducing funded status volatility. To meet these objectives, investment managers are engaged to actively manage assets within the guidelines and strategies set forth by the Investment Committee. Active managers are monitored regularly and their performance is compared to applicable benchmarks. As a result of our long-term U.S. investment objectives for pension assets, the weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on assets decreased from 7.77% during 2020 to 6.50% in 2021.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nPlan assets valued utilizing Level 1 inputs include equity investments, corporate debt instruments and U.S. government securities. Fair values were determined by closing prices for those securities traded on national stock exchanges, while securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on the valuation date are valued at the mean between the last reported bid and ask prices.\n\nLevel 2 assets include fixed income securities that are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of other issues with similar credit ratings; mortgage-backed securities that are valued based on cash flow and yield models using acceptable modeling and pricing conventions; and certain investments that are pooled with other investments in a commingled fund. We value our investments in commingled funds by taking the percentage ownership of the underlying assets, each of which has a readily determinable fair value.\n\nFair value estimates for certain investments are based on unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by observable market data and are thus classified as Level 3.\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a net asset value (\"NAV\") or its equivalent developed consistent with FASB measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, risk parity funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds and risk parity funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31st. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two to three month notice period,",

      "answer": "In 2022, RTX (via Pratt & Whitney) held a 61% program share interest and a 49.5% ownership interest in IAE, which coordinates the V2500 engine program alongside MTU and Japanese Aero Engines Corporation (JAEC). By 2023, RTX continued its collaboration with JAEC under the same IAE framework, but its effective program share interest in IAE was adjusted to 57% after accounting for sub-collaborator shares. This indicates a slight recalibration of RTX's strategic involvement in the V2500 engine program, maintaining its leadership role while possibly redistributing economic participation among collaborators.",

According to the V_10k_2024 filing, Class A common stockholders have full voting rights on all matters, while Class B common stockholders have limited voting rights, applicable only to specific defined matters such as exiting the core payments business or certain merger and consolidation scenarios. The shift in share structure\u2014more Class B shares and fewer Class A shares\u2014suggests a potential dilution of broad shareholder influence, as voting power becomes concentrated among fewer Class A shareholders.

      "question": "How did the change in the proportion of structured settlement annuities underwritten on impaired lives between 2023 and 2024 impact GE's exposure to mortality risk, and what does this suggest about the evolution of their risk profile?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GE reinsured approximately 24,600 structured settlement annuities, primarily underwritten on impaired lives, which are associated with shorter-than-average life expectancies and thus lower mortality risk. By 2024, the number of such annuities had decreased to 23,400, and only 27% were underwritten on impaired lives. This reduction in the proportion of impaired-life contracts increased GE's overall exposure to mortality risk, as more policies were now associated with average or longer life expectancies. The shift suggests a transformation in GE's risk profile, with a growing liability duration and higher sensitivity to longevity trends, which is further compounded by the lack of premium adjustment flexibility in structured settlement annuities.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(a)    Pending completion of our December 31, 2024 statutory reporting process.\n\nStructured settlement annuities. We reinsure approximately 23,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 57. A pproximately 27% of these structured settlement annuities were underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than-average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment). Unlike long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nLife Insurance contracts. Our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. A t December 31, 2024, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance portfolio, we reinsure approximately $45 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.1 million policies with an average attained age of 63. In 2024, our incurred claims were approximately $0.4 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $46,100. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20- and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20- and 30-year level term policies, which represent approximately 7% and 43% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2026 and 2035 as the policies reach the end of their 20- and 30-year level premium period, respectively.\n\nCritical Accounting E stimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums and are estimated based on actuarial assumptions such as mortality, morbidity, terminations, and expenses. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings. Our annual review procedures include updating certain experience studies since our last completed review, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. The review of experience and assumptions is a comprehensive and complex process that depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. The review relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance portfolio includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.",

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS used estimated NAV to value its U.S. pension plan investments, including private debt, based on audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers, with adjustments made for investment activity between the report date and year-end. By 2024, the company continued to rely on NAV as a practical expedient for valuing private debt investments, but the disclosure of $2.7 billion in unfunded commitments to limited partnerships indicates a strategic continuation and potential expansion of long-term commitments to private debt funds. The persistence of NAV as the valuation method shows consistency in accounting policy, while the unfunded commitments suggest UPS expects sustained involvement and potential returns from these illiquid, long-term private debt investments.",

In order to estimate NAV, the Company evaluates audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers, and makes adjustments, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. These investments are not actively traded, and their values can only be estimated using these subjective assumptions.\n\nAuditing the estimated NAV of these hedge fund, risk parity, private debt, private equity and real estate investments requires a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity to evaluate the completeness, reliability and relevance of the inputs used by management.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the inputs used by management to estimate the NAV of the U.S. Plans' hedge fund, risk parity, private debt, private equity and real estate investments included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls, including those related to the reliability of values reported by fund managers, the relevance of asset class benchmark returns, and the completeness and accuracy of unobservable inputs related to the underlying assets of the funds.\n- For certain investments, we confirmed directly with the respective fund manager its preliminary estimate of the fund's NAV as of December 31, 2021.\n- For certain investments, we inquired of management to understand year-over-year changes in the fund manager's estimate of NAV and compared the fund's return on investment to other available qualitative and quantitative information relevant to the fund.\n- We evaluated the Company's historical ability to accurately estimate NAV for these funds by comparing each fund's recorded valuation as of its prior fiscal year end to the NA V per the audited fund financial statements (which are received in arrears of the Company's reporting timetable).\n\n## Revenue - Refer to Note 2, Revenue Recognition, to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nApproximately 82 percent of the Company's revenues are from its global small package operations that provide time-definite delivery services for express letters, documents, small packages and palletized freight via air and ground services. The Company's global small package revenues are comprised of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions sourced from systems that were primarily developed by the Company. The processing of transactions, including the recording of them, is highly automated and based on contractual terms with the Company's customers.\n\nAuditing global small package revenue required a significant extent of effort and the involvement of professionals with expertise in information technology ('IT') necessary for us to identify, test, and evaluate the Company's systems, software applications and automated controls.",

Real estate consists of property funds and REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts). REITS are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which it is traded.\n\nAbsolute return consists of private partnership interests in hedge funds, insurance contracts, derivative instruments, hedge fund of funds, and other alternative investments. Insurance consists of insurance contracts, which are valued using cash surrender values which is the amount the plan would receive if the contract was cashed out at year end. Derivative instruments consist of various swaps and bond futures that are used to help manage risks.\n\nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include the net of interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased and interest payable.\n\nThe balances of and changes in the fair values of the international pension plans' level 3 assets consist primarily of insurance contracts under the absolute return asset class. In 2021 the aggregate of net purchases and net unrealized gains and losses decreased this balance by $7 million and the change in currency exchange rates decreased this balance by $44 million for a net decrease of $51 million. In 2020 the aggregate net purchases and net unrealized gains decreased this balance by $1 million and the change in currency exchange rates increased the balance by $44 million for a net increase to this balance of $43 million.\n\n## NOTE 14. Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3M's financial position and performance.\n\nAdditional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:\n\n- Impact on other comprehensive income of nonderivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 8.\n- Fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 15.\n- Derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company's long-term debt are also described in Note 12.\n\nRefer to the section below titled Statement of Income Location and Impact of Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments for details on the location within the consolidated statements of income for amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow or fair value hedges (along with similar information relative to the hedged items) and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Additional information relative to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included below as applicable.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges:\n\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts: The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income for de-designated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in the value of derivative instruments after de-designation are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments section below. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months.",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

The Company may enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including certain intercompany financing balances. As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the Company's net investments in foreign operations. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, an instantaneous 10% change in applicable foreign currency spot exchange rates would have increased/decreased the aggregate fair value carrying amount of foreign exchange forward and option contracts by up to approximately $24 million and by approximately $175 million, respectively. The similar impact on non-functional currency denominated debt used as hedging instruments would be approximately $182 million and $192 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nInterest Rates Risk: The Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest rate risk and expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, an instantaneous 100 basis point change in applicable interest rates would increase/decrease the Company's pre-tax earnings by approximately $10 million and $13 million, respectively, on an annualized basis as it relates to 3M's floating-rate notes and interest rate swap agreements.\n\nCommodity Prices Risk: The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements. 3M does not enter into derivative financial instruments associated with commodities.\n\n## Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 238)\n\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Index to Financial Statements\n\nA complete summary of Form 10-K content, including the index to financial statements, is found at the beginning of this document.\n\n## Management's Responsibility for Financial Reporting\n\nManagement is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial information included in this report. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Where necessary, the financial statements reflect estimates based on management's judgment.\n\nManagement has established and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting for the Company and its subsidiaries. This system and its established accounting procedures and related controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that the books and records properly reflect all transactions, that policies and procedures are implemented by qualified personnel, and that published financial statements are properly prepared and fairly presented. The Company's system of internal control over financial reporting is supported by widely communicated written policies, including business conduct policies, which are designed to require all employees to maintain high ethical standards in the conduct of Company affairs. Internal auditors continually review the accounting and control system.\n\n## 3M Company\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting. Management conducted an assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n\nThe Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which ex presses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\n\n## 3M Company",

          "chunk_text": "## FEDEX CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\n\nNew accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly impact our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements. We believe the following new accounting guidance is relevant to the readers of our financial statements.\n\nNew Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to existing contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The amendments apply only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') or another reference rate to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The guidance was effective upon issuance and can generally be applied through December 31, 2022. While there has been no material effect to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows from reference rate reform as of May 31, 2022, we continue to monitor our contracts and transactions for potential application of this ASU. See Note 7 for information on the replacement of LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR') in our Credit Agreements (defined below) on March 15, 2022.\n\nIn July 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-05, Leases (Topic 842), which provides alternative accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases with variable lease payments. The guidance allows lessors to classify and account for a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on a reference index or rate as an operating lease if certain criteria are met. These changes will be effective June 1, 2022 (fiscal 2023). We do not have leases classified as sales-type or direct financing and will apply the guidance on a prospective basis to applicable leases that commence or are modified on or after June 1, 2022.\n\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832), which requires annual disclosures that increase the transparency of transactions involving government grants, including (1) the types of transactions, (2) the accounting for those transactions, and (3) the effect of those transactions on an entity's financial statements. These changes will be effective June 1, 2022 (fiscal 2023). This standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 3: CREDIT LOSSES\n\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our trade receivables. We assess ability to pay for certain customers by conducting a credit review, which considers the customer's established credit rating and our assessment of creditworthiness. We determine the allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable using a combination of specific reserves for accounts that are deemed to exhibit credit loss indicators and general reserves that are determined using loss rates based on historical write-offs by geography and recent forecast information, including underlying economic expectations. We update our estimate of credit loss reserves quarterly, considering recent write-offs, collections information, and underlying economic expectations.\n\nCredit losses were $403 million in 2022, $577 million in 2021, and $442 million in 2020. Our allowance for credit losses was $340 million as of May 31, 2022 and $358 million at May 31, 2021.\n\n## NOTE 4: BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\n\nOn December 23, 2020, we acquired ShopRunner, Inc. ('ShopRunner'), an e-commerce platform that directly connects brands and merchants with online shoppers, for $228 million in cash from operations. The majority of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and intangibles. The financial results of ShopRunner are included in 'Corporate, other, and eliminations' from the date of acquisition and were not material to our results of operations; therefore, pro forma financial information has not been provided.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GE's 10-K filing noted that UFLIC's trust assets were held for the benefit of Genworth's insurance subsidiaries, which had publicly stated that proceeds from their contingency plan would be used to repay parent company debt rather than bolster the capital position of their insurance subsidiaries. This raised concerns about potential actions by Genworth or its regulators that could adversely affect UFLIC, including control over assets in the relevant trusts. By 2023, GE's filing indicated that some trust agreements associated with reinsurance contracts allowed ceding companies to withdraw trust assets and hold them on their balance sheets under their control for the benefit of UFLIC. This shift in control rights increased UFLIC's exposure to the financial stability and decision-making of the ceding insurers, particularly Genworth, whose solvency concerns could lead to actions affecting UFLIC's access to or control over those assets. For GE, this evolution in trust arrangements heightened the risk of future capital contributions or liquidity stress if adverse developments impacted the solvency or financial strength of these ceding insurers.",

          "chunk_text": "capital markets, and a significant downgrade could have an adverse commercial impact on our businesses. In addition, swap, forward and option contracts are executed under standard master agreements that typically contain mutual downgrade provisions that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the credit ratings of the applicable GE entity were to fall below specified ratings levels agreed upon with the counterparty. For additional discussion about our current credit ratings and related considerations, refer to the Capital Resources and Liquidity - Credit Ratings and Conditions section within MD&amp;A.\n\nFinancial services operations - We continue to have exposure to insurance, credit, legal and other risks in our financial services operations and, in the event of future adverse developments, may not be able to meet our business and financial objectives without further actions or additional capital contributions . To fund the statutory capital contributions that we expect to make to our insurance subsidiaries over the next several years, as well as to meet our debt maturities and other obligations, we expect to rely on liquidity from our operations. There is a risk that future adverse developments could cause liquidity or funding stress. For example, it is possible that future requirements for capital contributions to the insurance subsidiaries will be greater than currently estimated or could be accelerated by regulators. Our annual testing of insurance reserves is subject to a variety of assumptions, including assumptions about the discount rate (which is sensitive to changes in market interest rates), morbidity, mortality and future long-term care premium increases. Any future adverse changes to these assumptions (to the extent not offset by any favorable changes to these assumptions) could result in an increase to future policy benefit reserves and, potentially, to the amount of capital we are required to contribute to the insurance subsidiaries (as discussed in the Other Items - Insurance section within MD&amp;A). We also anticipate that the new insurance accounting standard scheduled to be effective on January 1, 2023 (as discussed in the Other Items - New Accounting Standards section within MD&amp;A) will materially affect our financial statements and require changes to certain of our processes, systems, and controls. In addition, we continue to evaluate strategic options to accelerate the further reduction in the size of our financial services operations. Some of these options could have a material financial charge or other adverse effects depending on the timing, negotiated terms and conditions of any ultimate arrangements. It is also possible that contingent liabilities and loss estimates from our financial services-related continuing or discontinued operations, such as those related to Bank BPH (see Note 22), will need to be recognized or increase in the future and will become payable. There can be no assurance that future liabilities, losses or impairments to the carrying value of assets within our financial services operations would not materially and adversely affect GE's business, financial position, cash flows, results of operations or capacity to provide financing to support orders at the businesses.\n\nCustomers &amp; counterparties - Global economic, industry-specific or other developments that weaken the soundness of significant customers, governments, financial institutions or other parties we deal with can adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. The business and operating results of our businesses have been, and will continue to be, affected by worldwide economic conditions, including conditions in the air transportation, power generation, renewable energy, healthcare and other industries we serve. Existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services, including large infrastructure projects, and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all as a result of business deterioration, cash flow shortages or difficulty obtaining financing for particular projects or due to macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical disruptions, changes in law or other challenges affecting the strength of the global economy. The airline industry, for example, is highly cyclical, and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the U.S. and international economies. Aviation industry activity is also particularly influenced by a small group of large original equipment manufacturers, as well as large airlines in various geographies, and our credit exposure to some of our largest aviation customers is significant. As described above, the current extended disruption of regional and international air travel from the COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our airframer and airline customers. A potential future disruption in connection with a terrorist incident, cyberattack, actual or threatened public health emergency or recessionary economic environment that results in the loss of business and leisure traffic could also adversely affect these customers, their ability to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all, demand for our products and services and the viability of a customer's business. Secular, cyclical or other pressures facing customers across our energy businesses, including in connection with decarbonization, industry consolidation and competition and shifts in the availability of financing for certain types of power projects or technologies (such as prohibitions on financing for fossil fuel-based projects or technologies), can also have a significant impact on the operating results and outlooks for our businesses operating in those industries. Our financial services operations also have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, including customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging markets, and we transact with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit and other risks in the event of insolvency or other default of its counterparty or client. For example, a portion of our run-off insurance operations' assets are held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts. For UFLIC, such trust assets are currently held in trusts for the benefit of insurance company subsidiaries of Genworth, which during 2021 publicly stated any proceeds from its contingency plan will be used to repay parent company debt and not bolster the capital position of its insurance subsidiaries. Solvency or other concerns about Genworth or its insurance company subsidiaries may cause those subsidiaries or their regulators to take or attempt to take actions that could adversely affect UFLIC, including control over assets in the relevant trusts. In addition, our customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. federal government and state and local entities. We also at times face greater challenges collecting on receivables with customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging markets. If there is significant deterioration in the global economy, in our industries, in financial markets or with particular significant counterparties, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n\nPostretirement benefit plans - Increases in pension, healthcare and life insurance benefits obligations and costs can adversely affect our earnings , cash flows and further progress toward our leverage goals . Our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations, which reflect assumptions about financial markets, interest rates and other economic conditions such as the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

      "answer": "Emerson's performance share valuation dropped significantly from $165M in fiscal 2023 to $90M in fiscal 2024. This decline occurred alongside the integration of AspenTech's stock-based compensation plans, which included performance shares, restricted stock units, and stock options. Following the creation of New AspenTech - where Emerson retained a 55% ownership stake - the company appears to have recalibrated its executive compensation structure, potentially aligning it with the new ownership arrangement and signaling a strategic shift in how performance-based incentives would be managed within the restructured organization.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing disclosed that for private debt investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis, they used NAVs adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. By 2024, Boeing maintained a similar approach, explicitly stating that NAVs for private debt were adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events, indicating a consistent methodology. However, the continued reliance on NAV as a practical expedient, without a readily determinable fair value, suggests Boeing's approach to valuing illiquid private debt remained dependent on fund managers' reporting and adjustments, with no indication of adopting more direct valuation techniques over time.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

By 2024, this figure increased to $8 million, showing a growing operational involvement and restructuring efforts tied to AspenTech.

The increase in restructuring costs suggests intensified efforts to align AspenTech\u2019s operations with EMR\u2019s strategic goals, such as streamlining operations or integrating systems post-acquisition.

      "question": "How did the FAA certification timeline for the G700 aircraft in 2023 influence the delivery performance and revenue impact of the G700 in 2024, particularly in light of supplier quality issues and component delays?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GD anticipated FAA certification of the G700 aircraft in early 2024, which prompted a ramp-up in production and contributed to an increase in total inventories. However, in 2024, despite achieving FAA and EASA certification and beginning deliveries in Q2, the number of G700 deliveries was negatively impacted by supplier quality escapes, late component deliveries, and out-of-station work. These issues delayed the expected revenue realization from the G700, which had been positioned as a key growth driver following its certification. The temporal chain shows how the regulatory milestone in 2023 set production and inventory expectations, but 2024 operational challenges limited the aircraft's financial contribution.",

GE recognized revenue and costs based on its scope of work and made substantial arms-length sales of parts and services to CFM International. This revenue-sharing model laid the foundation for GE's continued financial interdependence with CFM International in 2024, as the LEAP engine entered a significant production ramp-up phase. By 2024, CFM International remained a critical joint venture, with GE making substantial sales of parts and services to support the LEAP engine's increasing shop visits and MRO demand.

          "chunk_text": "ABOUT GE AEROSPACE. General Electric Company operates as GE Aerospace (GE Aerospace or the Company). GE Aerospace is a global aerospace leader with the industry's largest and growing commercial propulsion fleet. The Company's installed base of approximately 45,000 commercial and 25,000 military engines drives our aftermarket services business, which represents approximately 70% of revenue, reflecting the strength of customer demand across our business. Through FLIGHT DECK, the Company's proprietary lean operating model, GE Aerospace is prioritizing safety, quality, delivery and cost, to drive focused execution and bridge strategy to results. We are focused on delivering against our strategic priorities for today (services and readiness), tomorrow (delivering the production and services ramp for new engines) and the future (inventing next generation flight technology for our commercial and defense customers). Our global team is building on more than a century of innovation and learning, as we invent the future of flight, lift people up and bring them home safely.\n\nOn January 3, 2023, the Company completed the separation of its healthcare business into an independent publicly traded company, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (GE HealthCare), and on April 2, 2024, the Company completed the separation of its GE V ernova business into an independent publicly traded company, GE Vernova, Inc. (GE Vernova). In connection with these separations, the historical results of GE HealthCare and GE V ernova, and certain assets and liabilities included in the separations, are reported in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. See Note 2 for further information.\n\nWe serve customers in approximately 120 countries. M anufacturing and service operations are carried out at 67 facilities located in 22 states in the United States and Puerto Rico, of which 24 are owned, and at 67 facilities located in 24 other countries, of which 34 are owned.\n\nSEGMENTS. GE Aerospace operates through two reportable segments: Commercial Engines &amp; Services and Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies.\n\nCOMMERCIAL ENGINES &amp; SERVICES. Commercial Engines &amp; Services (CES) designs, develops, manufactures and services jet engines for commercial airframes, as well as business aviation and aeroderivative applications. Services include maintenance, repair and overhaul (M RO) of engines and the sale of spare parts, and we offer services under a variety of arrangements such as long-term service agreements or time and material contracts. CES was approximately 70% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, with services representing 74% of total CES revenue.\n\nOur CES customers for equipment and services consist primarily of airframers and airlines, including both Boeing and A irbus, and third-party M RO shops, to whom we sell equipment and license M RO technology. CES engines power aircraft in all commercial categories-narrowbody, widebody and regional-and this includes engines sold by joint venture partners, the most significant of which is CFM  International, a 50-50 non-consolidated joint venture with Safran A ircraft Engines, a subsidiary of Safran Group of France. Depending on the aircraft model, airline customers may have a choice between our engines and those of other manufacturers or, as in the case of some Boeing models, our engines may be the sole source engine for a particular aircraft.\n\nCommercial and financial dynamics for major engine platforms often play out over the course of many years, as new product development cycles are long and, after initial sale, commercial engines can operate for decades with services in the aftermarket. In the narrowbody aircraft segment, we are in the midst of a significant ramp in production of the LEA P engine, which entered into service in 2016 and is expected in the coming years to overtake the mature CFM 56 as the industry's most utilized narrowbody engine. This is expected to also drive a significant increase in shop visits and need for M RO capacity as LEA P engines come due for services. In the widebody aircraft segment, we have a range of engine platforms that are in different stages of their lifecycles. These include the more mature CF6 and GE90 engines, as well as the GEnx engine that entered into service in 2011 and the GE9X engine that will power the Boeing 777X  when that aircraft enters into serv ice. We also have engines that power regional and business aircraft.\n\nWe have been and remain committed to investing in developing and maturing technologies that enable a more sustainable future of flight. Notably, CFM International's Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) program is a suite of pioneering technologies including Open Fan, compact core and hybrid electric systems for compatibility with alternative fuels. We recently completed more than 250 tests on developing a full-scale Open Fan engine. This is one of several initiativ es underway to help invent the future of flight.\n\nDEFENSE &amp; PROPULSION TECHNOLOGIES. Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies (DPT) is a leading provider of defense engines and critical aircraft systems, and it consists of our Defense &amp; Systems and Propulsion &amp; A dditive Technologies businesses. DPT was approximately 25% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, with services representing 56% of total DPT revenue.\n\nDefense &amp; Systems - Defense &amp; Systems designs, develops, manufactures and services jet engines and avionics and power systems for governments, militaries and commercial airframers. Services include M RO of engines and the sale of spare parts.\n\nOur product performance and dedication to innovation have earned long-standing relationships with airframers, shipyards, government agencies and other customers globally. We also regularly work with government customers on the development of classified and unclassified advanced products, including combat engines, hypersonics and unmanned applications. Recently, our team successfully demonstrated a hybrid electric propulsion system rated at one megawatt with the U.S. A rmy.\n\nOur defense engines power a wide variety of fighters, bombers, tankers, transport, helicopters and surveillance aircraft, as well as aeroderivative engines for marine applications. Significant product platforms include the F110, F404 and F414 for combat engines, the T408, T700 and T901 for rotorcraft engines and the LM2500 for mobility and marine engines.",

          "chunk_text": "EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS. Equity method investments are investments in entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest, but over which we have significant influence. Significant influence typically exists if we have a 20% to 50% ownership interest in the investee. Equity method investments are assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when events occur, or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not the fair value of the asset is below its carrying value. If a decline in the v alue of an equity  method inv estment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. Equity method investments are recognized within A ll other assets in our Statement of Financial Position. Our share of the results of equity method investments is recognized within Other income (loss) in our Statement Earnings (Loss) since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with our operations. See Notes 9 and 26 for further information.\n\nWe enter into related party transactions with certain equity method investments, of which, the most significant are with CFM  International, a non-consolidated company jointly owned with Safran Aircraft Engines, a subsidiary of Safran Group of France. We make substantial sales of parts and services to CFM International. Related party transactions with other equity method investees primarily consist of purchases of engine parts or maintenance services, which are not significant with any single related party.\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVES. We receive grants and incentives from various federal, state, local, and foreign governments in exchange for compliance with certain conditions relating to our activities in a specific jurisdiction which encourage investment, job creation and retention, and environmental objectives including emissions reductions. We recognize government grants as a reduction to the related expense or asset when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions of the grant, the grant is received or is probable of receipt and the amount is determinable. Government grants resulted in reductions of $117 million, $99 million and $100 million to research and development expense in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term cash investment that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less, including debt securities and money market instruments unless classified as available-for-sale investment securities. Restricted cash primarily comprised funds restricted in connection with certain ongoing litigation matters and amounted to an insignificant amount at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES. We report investments in available-for-sale debt securities and certain equity securities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded to other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recorded to earnings.\n\nAlthough we generally do not have the intent to sell any specific debt securities in the ordinary course of managing our portfolio, we may sell debt securities prior to their maturities for a v ariety  of reasons, including div ersification, credit quality , y ield and liquidity  requirements and the funding of claims and obligations to policyholders.\n\nWe regularly review investment securities for impairment. For debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate qualitative criteria, such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, to determine whether we do not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. We also evaluate quantitative criteria including determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. If we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, we consider the security to contain an expected credit loss, and we record the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its recoverable amount in earnings as an allowance for credit loss and the difference between the security's recoverable amount and fair value in other comprehensive income. If we intend to sell the security  or it is more likely  than not we will be required to sell the security  before recov ery  of its amortiz ed cost basis, the security  is considered impaired, and we recognize the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value in earnings. See Note 3 for further information.\n\nCURRENT RECEIVABLES. Amounts due from customers arising from the sales of equipment and services are recorded at the outstanding amount, less allowance for losses. We regularly monitor the recoverability of our receivables. See Note 4 for further information.\n\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. When we record customer receivables and contract assets arising from revenue transactions, as well as commercial mortgage loans and reinsurance recoverables in our run-off insurance operations, financial guarantees and certain commitments, we record an allowance for credit losses for the current expected credit losses (CECL) inherent in the asset over its expected life. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account deducted from the amortized cost basis of the assets to present their net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected. Each period, the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through earnings to reflect expected credit losses over the remaining lives of the assets. We evaluate debt securities with unrealized losses to determine whether any of the losses arise from concerns about the issuer's credit or the underlying collateral and record an allowance for credit losses, if required.\n\nWe estimate expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. When measuring expected credit losses, we pool assets with similar country risk and credit risk characteristics. Changes in the relevant information may significantly affect the estimates of expected credit losses.\n\nINVENTORIES. All inv entories are stated at lower of cost or realiz able v alues. Cost of inv entories is primarily  determined using the av erage cost method. See Note 5 for further information.\n\n44 2024 FORM  10-K",

      "question": "How did GE's liability exposure from structured settlement annuities through Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company change from 2022 to 2023, particularly in relation to the inflexibility of adjusting premiums on these contracts?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GE's liability for structured settlement annuities through Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC) was $10.3 billion. By 2023, GE reinsured approximately 24,600 structured settlement annuities, primarily underwritten on impaired lives with projected payments extending decades into the future. A key risk highlighted in 2023 is that, unlike long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits, which constrains GE's ability to manage long-term liability exposure. This lack of flexibility, combined with the long duration of these contracts, means that GE must rely solely on initial pricing assumptions without the ability to adjust for changes in mortality or interest rates over time, potentially increasing the risk of liability growth beyond initial estimates.",

          "chunk_text": "## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. The run-off insurance operations of North American Life and Health (NALH) primarily include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumes long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumes long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc.(Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004. The vast majority of NALH's reinsurance exposures are long-duration arrangements that still involve substantial levels of premium collections and benefit payments even though ERAC and UFLIC have not entered into new reinsurance treaties in more than a decade. These long-duration arrangements involve a number of direct writers and contain a range of risk transfer provisions and other contractual elements. In many instances, these arrangements do not transfer to us 100 percent of the risk embodied in the encompassed underlying policies issued by the direct writers. Furthermore, we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies.\n\nOur run-off insurance liabilities and annuity benefits primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for those insurance contract claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported. The insurance liabilities and annuity benefits amounted to $37.2 billion and $42.2 billion and primarily relate to individual long- term care insurance reserves of $21.7 billion and $21.3 billion and structured settlement annuities and life insurance reserves of $10.3 billion and $10.7 billion, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in insurance liabilities and annuity benefits of $5.0 billion from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to an adjustment of $4.8 billion resulting from the higher margin from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities that would result in a premium deficiency should those gains be realized.\n\nIn addition to NALH, Electric Insurance Company (EIC) is a property and casualty insurance company primarily providing insurance to GE and its employees with net claim reserves of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We believe recent elevated mortality across our portfolio and lower long-term care insurance claims are short term in nature and attributable to COVID-19. However, the effects of COVID-19, including the continued emergence of variants and success of vaccinations, remain uncertain and may result in variability in levels of future mortality and long-term care insurance claims activity, including changes in policyholder behavior (e.g., policyholder willingness to enter long-term care facilities or seek care at home), among others. These monitoring activities also allow us to evaluate opportunities to reduce our insurance risk profile and improve the results of our run-off insurance operations. Such opportunities may include the pursuit of future premium rate increases and benefit reductions on long-term care insurance contracts in accordance with our reinsurance contracts with our ceding companies; recapture and reinsurance transactions to reduce risk where economically justified; investment strategies to improve asset and liability matching and enhance investment portfolio yields; and managing our expense levels.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. For example, policyholders with a lifetime benefit period could receive coverage up to the specified daily maximum as long as the policyholder is claim eligible and receives care for covered services; inflation protection options increase the daily maximums to protect the policyholder from the rising cost of care with some options providing automatic annual increases of 3% to 5% or policyholder elected inflation-indexed increases for increased premium; joint life policies provide coverage for two lives which permit either life under a single contract to receive benefits at the same time or separately; and premium payment options may limit the period over which the policyholder pays premiums while still receiving coverage after premium payments cease, which may limit the impact of our benefit from future premium rate increases.\n\nThe ERAC long-term care insurance portfolio comprises more than two-thirds of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is assumed from approximately 30 ceding companies through various types of reinsurance and retrocession contracts having complex terms and conditions. Compared to the overall long-term care insurance block, it has a lower average attained age and more policies (and covered lives, as over one-third of the policies are joint life policies) with lifetime benefit periods and/or with inflation protection options which may result in a higher potential for future claims.\n\nThe UFLIC long-term care insurance block comprises the remainder of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is more mature with policies that are more uniform, as it is assumed from a single ceding company, Genworth, and has fewer policies with lifetime benefit periods, no joint life policies and slightly more policies with inflation protection options.\n\nPresented in the table below are GAAP and statutory reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

However, the effects of COVID-19, including the continued emergence of variants and success of vaccinations, remain uncertain and may result in variability in levels of future mortality and long-term care insurance claims activity, including changes in policyholder behavior (e.g., policyholder willingness to enter long-term care facilities or seek care at home), among others. These monitoring activities also allow us to evaluate opportunities to reduce our insurance risk profile and improve the results of our run-off insurance operations. Such opportunities may include the pursuit of future premium rate increases and benefit reductions on long-term care insurance contracts in accordance with our reinsurance contracts with our ceding companies; recapture and reinsurance transactions to reduce risk where economically justified; investment strategies to improve asset and liability matching and enhance investment portfolio yields; and managing our expense levels.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. For example, policyholders with a lifetime benefit period could receive coverage up to the specified daily maximum as long as the policyholder is claim eligible and receives care for covered services; inflation protection options increase the daily maximums to protect the policyholder from the rising cost of care with some options providing automatic annual increases of 3% to 5% or policyholder elected inflation-indexed increases for increased premium; joint life policies provide coverage for two lives which permit either life under a single contract to receive benefits at the same time or separately; and premium payment options may limit the period over which the policyholder pays premiums while still receiving coverage after premium payments cease, which may limit the impact of our benefit from future premium rate increases.\n\nThe ERAC long-term care insurance portfolio comprises more than two-thirds of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is assumed from approximately 30 ceding companies through various types of reinsurance and retrocession contracts having complex terms and conditions. Compared to the overall long-term care insurance block, it has a lower average attained age and more policies (and covered lives, as over one-third of the policies are joint life policies) with lifetime benefit periods and/or with inflation protection options which may result in a higher potential for future claims.\n\nThe UFLIC long-term care insurance block comprises the remainder of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is more mature with policies that are more uniform, as it is assumed from a single ceding company, Genworth, and has fewer policies with lifetime benefit periods, no joint life policies and slightly more policies with inflation protection options.\n\nPresented in the table below are GAAP and statutory reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GE disclosed that it eliminated issue age adjustments in morbidity assumptions for long-term care insurance starting in 2017, based on evidence that these adjustments had minimal impact on claim projections. This approach was carried forward into 2023, where the company's statutory testing of insurance reserves continued to depend heavily on morbidity assumptions, among other factors. However, in 2023, GE explicitly highlighted the risk that adverse changes in morbidity assumptions could increase future policy benefit reserves and require additional capital contributions to insurance subsidiaries. This indicates that while the modeling approach remained consistent, the sensitivity of reserves to morbidity assumptions increased, thereby elevating the potential financial exposure from long-term care insurance liabilities.",

Assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contracts and trust agreements. Some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of ERAC or UFLIC which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates and benefit utilization rates); morbidity improvement (i.e., assumed rate of improvement in morbidity in the future); mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force); anticipated premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, including actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2030, on long-term care insurance policies; and interest rates. Assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.\n\nClaim reserves . Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. Key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. Claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.\n\nReinsurance recoverables . We cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies, and record receivables for estimated recoveries as we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholders or cedents. These receivables are estimated in a manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves. Reserves ceded to reinsurers, net of allowance, were $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in the caption All other assets in our Statement of Financial Position.\n\nPremium Deficiency Testing . We annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. The premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. A comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. Premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nThe primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include:\n\nMorbidity . Morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. For long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last). Prior to 2017, premium deficiency assumptions considered the risk of anti-selection by including issue age adjustments to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long-term care policies issued to younger individuals would exhibit lower expected incidences and claim costs than those issued to older policyholders. Recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curves indicated issue age differences had minimal impact on claim cost projections, and, accordingly, beginning in 2017, issue age adjustments were eliminated in developing morbidity assumptions. Higher morbidity increases, while lower morbidity decreases, the present value of expected future benefit payments.",

      "question": "How did the financial risk profile of Boeing's Commercial Crew program evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in relation to fixed-price development contract cost estimation challenges and supply chain disruptions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing's Commercial Crew program was already identified as a high-risk fixed-price development contract due to its technical complexity and limited historical data, which made cost estimation highly uncertain. The audit process highlighted extensive scrutiny over cost estimates, with auditors performing site visits, retrospective reviews, and inquiries into project status and challenges. By 2024, the financial risk had increased due to ongoing supply chain and labor disruptions, which compounded the existing technical complexities. Auditors noted that these disruptions significantly affected cost estimation processes, requiring even more judgment and specialized industry expertise to assess the evolving cost structures and margin forecasts. The program remained a critical audit matter both years, but the nature of the risk evolved from primarily technical uncertainty in 2022 to a combination of technical and operational (supply chain) volatility in 2024.",

        "Hop 1: BA(2022) \u2192 Fixed-Price Development Contracts: Boeing's 2022 disclosures highlighted that Commercial Crew was among several high-risk fixed-price development contracts, noting that technical issues could lead to schedule delays and higher costs, with the KC-46A Tanker already having incurred $402 million in additional losses.",
        "Hop 2: Fixed-Price Development Contracts \u2192 Commercial Crew: The 2022 audit procedures specifically called out Commercial Crew as a complex fixed-price development contract requiring extensive auditor judgment, including site visits and retrospective reviews to validate cost estimates.",

The U.S. government contracting party  may  modify,  curtail  or  terminate  its  contracts  and  subcontracts  with  us,  without  prior  notice  and  either  at  its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such  as  'continuing  resolutions'  rather  than  full-year  appropriations.  Any  loss  or  anticipated  loss  or  reduction  of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable  under  U.S.  government  contracts. U.S.  government  agencies,  including  the  Defense  Contract  Audit Agency  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency,  routinely  audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.\n\n## We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.\n\nOur BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 68% and 69% of their 2021 revenues from fixed-price contracts.  While  fixed-price  contracts  enable  us  to  benefit  from  performance  improvements,  cost  reductions  and efficiencies,  they  also  subject  us  to  the  risk  of  reduced  margins  or  incurring  losses  if  we  are  unable  to  achieve estimated costs and revenues. In addition, increased compliance costs and costs due to loss of productivity due to COVID-19 may not be reimbursed. If  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  price,  we  recognize  reach-forward losses  which  can  significantly  affect  our  reported  results.  For  example  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  recorded additional losses of $402 million on the KC-46A Tanker contract reflecting continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the  process  of  estimating  costs  and  revenues  on  fixed-price  contracts  inherently  risky.  Fixed-price  contracts  often contain  price  incentives  and  penalties  tied  to  performance,  which  can  be  difficult  to  estimate  and  have  significant impacts  on  margins.  In  addition,  some  of  our  contracts  have  specific  provisions  relating  to  cost,  schedule  and performance.\n\nFixed-price  development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  Examples  of  significant  BDS  fixed-price  development  contracts include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military satellites.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 2020 - $10.1 billion pre-tax actuarial loss related to benefit obligation:\n\n- Discount Rates ($7.3 billion pre-tax loss): The weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from 3.55% as of December 31, 2019 to 2.87% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decline in U.S. treasury yields that was slightly offset by an increase in credit spreads on AA-rated corporate bonds.\n- Coordinating benefits attributable to the Central States Pension Fund ($2.3 billion pre-tax loss): This represents our current best estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the Central States Pension Fund before taking into account the impact of the change in discount rates.\n- Demographic and Assumption Changes ($513 million pre-tax loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation changes, rates of termination, retirement, mortality and other changes.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Plan Assets\n\nPension assets are invested in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as investment guidelines established by plan trustees. The strategic asset mixes are specifically tailored for each plan given distinct factors, including liability and liquidity needs. Equities, alternative investments, and other higher yielding assets are utilized to generate returns and promote growth. Derivatives, repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements and fixed income securities are utilized as tools for duration management, mitigating interest rate risk, and minimizing funded status volatility.\n\nThe primary long-term investment objectives for pension assets are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital to meet future obligations while minimizing risk exposures and reducing funded status volatility. To meet these objectives, investment managers are engaged to actively manage assets within the guidelines and strategies set forth by the Investment Committee. Active managers are monitored regularly and their performance is compared to applicable benchmarks. As a result of our long-term U.S. investment objectives for pension assets, the weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on assets decreased from 7.77% during 2020 to 6.50% in 2021.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nPlan assets valued utilizing Level 1 inputs include equity investments, corporate debt instruments and U.S. government securities. Fair values were determined by closing prices for those securities traded on national stock exchanges, while securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on the valuation date are valued at the mean between the last reported bid and ask prices.\n\nLevel 2 assets include fixed income securities that are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of other issues with similar credit ratings; mortgage-backed securities that are valued based on cash flow and yield models using acceptable modeling and pricing conventions; and certain investments that are pooled with other investments in a commingled fund. We value our investments in commingled funds by taking the percentage ownership of the underlying assets, each of which has a readily determinable fair value.\n\nFair value estimates for certain investments are based on unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by observable market data and are thus classified as Level 3.\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a net asset value (\"NAV\") or its equivalent developed consistent with FASB measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, risk parity funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds and risk parity funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31st. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two to three month notice period,",

      "answer": "In 2023, UPS stated that its collectively-bargained contributions satisfied the FIP requirements for underfunded pension plans, including the New England Teamsters & Trucking Industry Pension Fund, without requiring surcharges. For that year, UPS contributed $234 million to this specific pension fund. In 2024, UPS remained subject to the same FIP requirements and continued to make contributions without surcharges, but its contribution to the New England Teamsters & Trucking Industry Pension Fund decreased to $224 million. This indicates that while UPS maintained compliance with the FIP framework, it adjusted its contribution level downward year-over-year, suggesting either stabilization of the plan\u2019s funding status or a strategic reallocation of pension contributions.",

      "answer": "In 2023, General Dynamics introduced the Symmetry Flight Deck as part of the G700 aircraft, highlighting it as the 'industry's most technologically advanced flight deck' and positioning the G700 to enter service after FAA certification in early 2024. By 2024, the G700 had indeed received FAA certification in March and began deliveries in the second quarter, marking a direct transition from development to production. This production ramp-up was noted in 2024 as the primary driver of an increase in total inventories, specifically tied to new Gulfstream models like the G700. The inclusion of the Symmetry Flight Deck not only defined the G700\u2019s technological differentiation but also aligned with General Dynamics\u2019 broader strategy of continuous R&D investment, which contributed to the aircraft\u2019s best-in-class capabilities and market positioning.",

      "answer": "In 2022, EMR reported AspenTech as a standalone segment with $0 revenue, signaling early integration challenges or strategic ambiguity. By 2023, AspenTech was no longer a standalone segment and was instead described as a core component of EMR's broader software and control strategy, indicating deeper integration into the company's offerings. This structural shift coincided with a rise in R&D investment from 6.3% in 2022 to 6.9% in 2023, suggesting that EMR was prioritizing internal development and integration of asset optimization software capabilities. The discontinuation of segment reporting likely reflects a strategic pivot to embed AspenTech's software expertise across EMR\u2019s broader portfolio rather than treating it as a separate business unit.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Caterpillar Insurance Co. Ltd. reinsured 100% of the international employee benefit plans of Caterpillar Inc. through retrocession agreements with other insurers, covering medical, accident, life, and disability benefits under its Class 2 and Class B insurance licenses. In 2024, this structure remained consistent, with Caterpillar Insurance Co. Ltd. continuing to reinsure 100% of the international employee benefit plans under the same licensing framework. This indicates that Caterpillar maintained a stable risk transfer mechanism through its Bermuda-based captive insurer, leveraging retrocession agreements to manage global employee benefit liabilities.",

      "answer": "In 2023, General Dynamics introduced the G500 with a new wing and avionics system, which replaced the G450 and G550 models and contributed to Gulfstream holding more than 355 city-pair speed records. This product enhancement was part of a broader strategy of continual R&D investment, which directly supported Gulfstream's positioning in 2024 as the standard bearer in new technology aircraft and industry leader in technologically advanced flight deck systems. By 2024, Gulfstream was explicitly recognized in the Aerospace segment as the leader in flight deck and cabin systems, a status reinforced by the G500's role in the all-new lineup of technologically advanced business jets.",

By 2024, the number of issued Class B shares increased slightly to 733, maintaining the same 33 1/3% aggregate voting power due to the structural dependency outlined in the Class A and Class B stock relationship. This dynamic ensures that despite the increase in Class B shares, the voting balance remains preserved, with Class A shares continuing to hold the remaining 66 2/3% of voting power.

      "question": "How did the change in UPS's valuation methodology controls for real estate investments, particularly through the NAV estimation process, evolve from 2023 to 2024 following the transition of the UPS Group Trust's investment management function to Goldman Sachs?",
      "answer": "In 2023, UPS valued its real estate investments as part of its U.S. pension plans using estimated NAV based on audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers, with adjustments for investment activity through December 31. Auditing these NAV estimates required significant auditor judgment due to the subjective nature of the inputs. In 2024, after the transition of the UPS Group Trust's investment management function to Goldman Sachs, UPS modified certain controls related to the reliability of values reported by fund managers and the accuracy of unobservable inputs used in NAV estimation. These changes were reflected in the audit procedures, which included testing the effectiveness of the newly designed controls. The evolution in controls indicates a strategic shift in how UPS managed and validated its NAV-based valuations for real estate investments, particularly in terms of governance and oversight under the new investment manager.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS(2023) \u2192 NAV: UPS used NAV as a practical expedient to value illiquid investments, including real estate, based on fund manager reports with adjustments.",
        "Hop 2: NAV \u2192 Real Estate Investments: Real estate investments were specifically subject to NAV-based valuation due to lack of active market pricing, with $9.9 billion in total alternative investments as of 2023.",
        "Hop 3: Real Estate Investments \u2190 UPS(2024): UPS continued using NAV for real estate but modified controls after transitioning investment management to Goldman Sachs, affecting audit procedures and oversight."

In order to estimate NAV, the Company evaluates audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers, and makes adjustments, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. These investments are not actively traded, and their values can only be estimated using these subjective assumptions.\n\nAuditing the estimated NAV of these hedge fund, private debt, private equity and real estate investments requires a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity to evaluate the completeness, reliability and relevance of the inputs used by management.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the inputs used by management to estimate the NAV of the U.S. Plans' hedge fund, private debt, private equity and real estate investments (collectively, the 'funds') included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls, including those related to the reliability of values reported by fund managers, the relevance of asset class benchmark returns, and the completeness and accuracy of unobservable inputs related to the underlying assets of the funds, including certain controls for which the control design was modified following the transition of the UPS Group Trust's investment management function to Goldman Sachs.\n- For a selection of investments, we evaluated certain inputs and recalculated ending values in accordance with management's processes and confirmed directly with the respective fund manager its preliminary estimate of the fund's NAV as of December 31, 2024.\n- We evaluated the Company's historical ability to accurately estimate NAV for these funds by comparing each fund's recorded valuation as of its prior fiscal year end to the NAV per the audited fund financial statements (which are received in arrears of the Company's reporting timetable).\n\n## Revenue - Refer to Note 2, Revenue Recognition, to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nApproximately 86 percent of the Company's revenues are from its global small package operations that provide time-definite delivery services for express letters, documents, small packages and palletized freight via air and ground services. The Company's global small package revenues are comprised of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions sourced from systems that were primarily developed by the Company. The processing of transactions, including the recording of them, is highly automated and based on contractual terms with the Company's customers.\n\nAuditing global small package revenue required a significant extent of effort and the involvement of professionals with expertise in information technology (\"IT\") necessary for us to identify, test, and evaluate the Company's systems, software applications, and automated controls.",

      "question": "How did the increased scrutiny of cost allowability under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in 2022 influence LMT's compliance risks and offset obligations in international defense contracts by 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, LMT faced heightened scrutiny from the U.S. Government over the allowability of environmental remediation costs at third-party-owned sites under FAR, which governs cost accounting and allocation for government contracts. This scrutiny created internal pressures to tighten compliance and cost management practices. By 2024, as LMT expanded its international sales (26% of total net sales), it encountered increased complexity in managing offset agreements\u2014such as local manufacturing support and technology transfers\u2014which required strict adherence to both U.S. and foreign regulations. The prior focus on domestic cost allowability under FAR likely intensified compliance risks in international operations, especially where offset obligations were subjective, long-term, or dependent on joint ventures outside LMT's control. This evolution demonstrates how domestic regulatory pressures under FAR cascaded into more cautious risk exposure in global defense contracts.",

We  have  significant  operations  in  geographic  areas prone  to  these  risks,  such  as  in  California,  Florida  and  Texas  and  certain  of  our  properties  have  suffered  damage  from  natural disasters  in  the  past  and  may  again  in  the  future.  We  could  incur  significant  costs  to  improve  the  climate  resiliency  of  our infrastructure and supply chain and otherwise prepare for, respond to, and mitigate the effects of climate change. In addition, under certain classified fixed price development and production contracts we are unable to insure risk of loss to government property because of the classified nature of the contracts and the inability to disclose classified information necessary for underwriting and claims to commercial insurers. Even if insurance coverage is available, we may not be able to obtain it in an amount, at a price or on terms acceptable to us. Some insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to provide us insurance given the nature of our business or products. Additionally, disputes with insurance carriers over coverage terms or the insolvency of one or more of our insurance carriers may significantly affect the amount or timing of our cash flows.\n\nSubstantial  costs  resulting  from  an  accident;  failure  of  or  defect  in  our  products  or  services;  natural  catastrophe  or  other incident; or liability arising from our products and services in excess of any legal protection, indemnity, and our insurance coverage (or for which indemnity or insurance is not available or not obtained) could adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows, and operating results. Any accident, failure of, or defect in our products or services, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. It also could affect the cost and availability of adequate insurance in the future.\n\n## Environmental costs and regulation, including in response to climate change, could adversely affect our future earnings as well as the affordability of our products and services.\n\nWe are  subject  to  federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  requirements  for  the  protection  of  the  environment,  including  those  for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. Due in part to the complexity and pervasiveness of these requirements, we are a party to or have property subject to various lawsuits, proceedings, and remediation obligations. These types of matters could result in fines, penalties, cost reimbursements or contributions, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We have incurred and will continue to incur liabilities for environmental remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at third-party-owned sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party as a result of our historical activities and those of our predecessor companies. Environmental remediation activities usually span many years, and the extent  of  financial  exposure  can  be  difficult  to  estimate.  Among  the  variables  management  must  assess  in  evaluating  costs associated with these cases and remediation sites are the status of site assessment, extent of the contamination, impacts on natural resources,  changing  cost  estimates,  evolution  of  technologies  used  to  remediate  the  site,  continually  evolving  environmental standards, availability of insurance coverage and indemnification under existing agreements and cost allowability issues, including varying  efforts  by  the  U.S.  Government  to  limit  allowability  of  our  costs  in  resolving  liability  at  third-party-owned  sites.  Our environmental  remediation  related  liabilities  could  also  significantly  increase  because  of  acquisitions,  the  regulation  of  new substances, stricter remediation standards for existing regulated substances, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws  and  regulations,  or  the  discovery  of  previously  unknown  or  more  extensive  contamination  or  new  contaminants.  For information  regarding  these  matters,  including  current  estimates  of  the  amounts  that  we  believe  are  required  for  environmental remediation to the extent probable and estimable, see 'Critical Accounting Policies - Environmental Matters' in the MD&amp;A and 'Note 15 - Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe manage and have managed various U.S. Government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. Government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs historically have been the responsibility of the U.S. Government. We have relied, and continue to rely with respect to past practices, on U.S. Government funding to pay such costs, notwithstanding efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit this responsibility. Although the U.S. Government remains responsible for capital and operating  costs  associated  with  environmental  compliance,  responsibility  for  fines  and  penalties  associated  with  environmental noncompliance typically is borne by either the U.S. Government or the contractor, depending on the contract and the relevant facts. Some environmental laws include criminal provisions. A conviction under environmental law could affect our ability to be awarded future or perform under existing U.S. Government contracts.\n\nThe increasing global regulatory focus on greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions and their potential impacts relating to climate change could result in laws, regulations or policies that significantly increase our direct and indirect operational and compliance burdens, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. These laws, regulations or policies could take  many  forms,  including  carbon  taxes,  cap  and  trade  regimes,  increased  efficiency  standards,  GHG  reduction  commitments, incentives or mandates for particular types of energy or changes in procurement laws. Changes in government procurement laws that mandate or take into account climate change considerations, such as the contractor's GHG emissions, lower emission products or other climate risks, in evaluating bids could result in costly changes to our operations or affect our competitiveness on future bids. In addition to incurring direct costs to implement any climate-change related laws, regulations or policies, we may see indirect costs rise, such as increased energy or material costs, as a result of policies affecting other",

We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.\n\n## REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

Higher interest rates increase the borrowing costs on new debt and could affect the fair value of our investments. Interest rates also impact our pension. For example, higher interest rates generally reduce the measure of our gross pension obligations while lower interest rates increase it.\n\nPublic health. We face a wide variety of risks related to public health crises, epidemics, pandemics or similar events. If a new health epidemic or outbreak were to occur, we could experience broad and varied effects similar to the impact of COVID-19, including adverse impacts to our workforce and supply chain, inflationary pressures and increased costs, schedule or production delays, market volatility and other financial ramifications. If any of these were to occur, our future results and performance could be adversely impacted.\n\n## International sales may pose different economic, regulatory, competition and other risks.\n\nInternational sales present risks that are different and potentially greater than those encountered in our U.S. business. In 2024, 26% of our total net sales were associated with international customers. International sales are subject to numerous political and economic factors, including changes in foreign national priorities, foreign  government  budgets,  global  economic  conditions,  and  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  the  possibility  of  trade  sanctions  and  other government actions, regulatory requirements, significant competition, taxation, and other risks associated with doing business outside the U.S. Sales of military products and services and any associated industrial development (offset) agreements are subject to U.S. export regulations and foreign policy, and there could be significant delays or other issues in reaching definitive agreements for announced programs. See the Risk Factor 'G eopolitical, macroeconomic and public health events and conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.' Competition for international sales is intense, including from international  manufacturers  whose  governments  sometimes  provide  research  and  development  assistance,  marketing  subsidies  and  other  assistance  for  their products and services.\n\nOur international business is conducted through FMS contracted through the U.S. G overnment and by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. FMS contracts with the U.S. G overnment are subject to the FAR and the DFARS. Because the U.S. G overnment functions as an intermediary in FMS sales, we are reliant on, and could be adversely impacted by, the capacity and speed of the DoD's administration of requests from non-U.S. countries to convert requests to sales. In contrast, DCS transactions represent sales directly to international customers and are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including product testing, import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, investments, tax ation, repatriation of earnings, ex change controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Control Reform Act of 2018. While we have extensive policies in place to comply with such laws and regulations, failure by us, our employees or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative,  civil,  or  criminal  liabilities,  including  suspension,  debarment  from  bidding  for  or  performing  government  contracts,  or  suspension  of  our  ex port privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We frequently team with international subcontractors and suppliers who also are exposed to similar risks.\n\nWe believe DCS transactions present a higher level of potential risks because they involve direct commercial relationships with parties with which we typically have less familiarity. Additionally, international procurement and local country rules and regulations, contract laws and judicial systems differ from those in the U.S. and,  in  some  cases,  may  be  less  predictable  than  those  in  the  U.S.,  which  could  impair  our  ability  to  enforce  contracts  and  increase  the  risk  of  adverse  or unpredictable outcomes, including the possibility that certain matters that would be considered civil matters in the  U.S. are treated as criminal matters in other countries.\n\nIn  conjunction  with  defense  procurements,  some  international  customers  require  contractors  to  comply  with  industrial  cooperation  regulations,  including entering into industrial participation, industrial development or localization agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements (also known as offset contracts), as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services. These offset agreements generally extend over several years and obligate the contractor to perform certain  commitments,  which  may  include  in-country  purchases,  technology  transfers,  local  manufacturing  support,  consulting  support  to  in-country  projects, investments in joint ventures and financial support projects, and preference for local suppliers or subcontractors. The customer's expectations in respect of the scope of offset commitments can be substantial, including high-value content, and may exceed existing local technical capability. Failure to meet these commitments, which can be subjective and outside of our control, may result in significant penalties, and could lead to a reduction in sales to a country. Furthermore, some of our existing offset agreements are dependent upon the successful operation of joint ventures that we do not control and involve products and services that are outside of our core business, which may increase the risk of breaching our obligations, exposing us to compliance risks of the joint venture, and impairing our ability to recover  our  investment.  For  more  information  on  our  industrial  development  obligations,  including  the  notional  value  of  our  remaining  industrial  development obligations  and  potential  penalties  for  non-compliance,  see  'Contractual  Commitments'  in  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and Results of Operations.",

In 2023, the company expanded its use of RSU awards, which do not carry voting rights, with $96 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs.

      "question": "How did GD's reliance on commercial paper issuances in 2022 compare to their 2024 disclosure of a $4 billion committed credit facility, and what does this shift suggest about their evolving liquidity strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GD emphasized that commercial paper issuances were a key component of their liquidity strategy, supplementing cash generated from operations to meet both short- and long-term needs. By 2024, GD disclosed that they had no commercial paper outstanding and instead maintained a $4 billion committed bank credit facility, set to expire in March 2027, which was explicitly designated to support working capital and potentially commercial paper issuances. This indicates a strategic shift from active reliance on short-term commercial paper to a more structured, long-term liquidity backup through a committed credit facility. The evolution suggests GD is prioritizing financial flexibility and risk mitigation in its capital structure.",

      "answer": "In 2022, BA operated under U.S. government contracts that were subject to termination for convenience or default, with compensation limited in the latter case, indicating a high dependency and risk exposure. By 2023, 37% of BA\u2019s revenues came from U.S. government contracts, highlighting an ongoing heavy reliance. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which governs these contracts, imposes extensive compliance requirements, including audits, cost allowability, and internal control standards. The sustained high proportion of revenue from these contracts in 2023, combined with evolving FAR compliance demands, likely increased BA\u2019s exposure to regulatory risk, especially as changes in FAR or non-compliance could lead to withheld payments, penalties, or loss of contracts. This shows that BA\u2019s exposure to FAR-related compliance risks remained significant and possibly intensified due to the continued heavy revenue dependence on government contracts.",

We aspire to achieve zero workplace injuries and provide a safe, open and accountable work environment for our employees. We provide several channels for all employees to speak up, ask for guidance and report concerns related to ethics or safety violations. We address employee concerns and take appropriate actions that uphold our Boeing values.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe  commercial  jet  aircraft  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  We  face  aggressive international  competitors  who  are  intent  on  increasing  their  market  share,  such  as  Airbus  and  other  entrants  from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with higher quality products.\n\nBDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Technologies Corporation, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their  North American  operations  and  partnering  with  U.S.  defense  companies.  In  addition,  certain  competitors  have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2022.\n\nThe commercial and defense services markets are extremely challenging and are made up of many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering products and services which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial airplane programs: training, fleet services and logistics, maintenance and engineering, modifications and upgrades, as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. BGS expects the market to remain highly competitive in 2022, and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\nOur businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We work with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to, all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.\n\nGovernment Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our  U.S.  government  contracts  were  to  be  terminated  for  convenience,  we  generally  would  be  entitled  to  receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.\n\nCommercial  Aircraft. In  the  U.S.,  our  commercial  aircraft  products  are  required  to  comply  with  FAA  regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. New aircraft models and new derivative aircraft are required to obtain FAA certification prior to entry into  service.  Outside  the  U.S.,  similar  requirements  exist  for  airworthiness,  installation  and  operational  approvals. These requirements are generally",

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

      "question": "How did the integration of Heritage AspenTech into EMR's financial reporting evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly regarding the impact on gross margin and ownership structure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, EMR's acquisition of Heritage AspenTech contributed 0.6 percentage points to gross margin improvement and established EMR's 55% ownership stake in the newly formed AspenTech, with former Heritage AspenTech stockholders owning the remaining 45%. By 2024, AspenTech's operations were fully integrated into EMR's financial reporting, with no standalone results for AspenTech. The integration also contributed to a higher gross profit of $8,885 million in 2024 compared to $7,427 million in 2023, despite the negative margin impact from acquisition-related inventory step-up amortization of $231 million.",

          "chunk_text": "Industrial Software Business'), along with approximately $6.0 billion in cash to Heritage AspenTech stockholders, to create \"New AspenTech\" (defined as \"AspenTech\" herein). Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis). AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech's prev ious name 'Aspen Technology, Inc.' and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under AspenTech's previous stock ticker symbol 'AZPN.' Due to the timing of the acquisition, the results for the first half of fiscal 2022 do not include the results of Heritage AspenTech.\n\nSee Notes 4, 5 and 8 and Item 1A - \"Risk Factors\" for further information on acquisitions and div estitures.\n\n## COST OF SALES\n\nCost of sales for 2024 were $8,607, an increase of $869 compared with $7,738 in 2023, reflecting the impact of higher v olume and the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition. Gross profit was $8,885 in 2024 compared to $7,427 in 2023, while gross margin increased 1.8 percentage points to 50.8 percent, reflecting the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition and higher price partially offset by the impact from acquisition-related inv entory step-up amortization of $231, which negativ ely impacted margins by approximately 1.3 percentage points.\n\nCost of sales for 2023 were $7,738, an increase of $240 compared with $7,498 in 2022. Gross profit was $7,427 in 2023 compared to $6,306 in 2022, while gross margin increased 3.3 percentage points to 49.0 percent due to fav orable price less net material inflation, the impact of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition which benefited margins by 0.6 percentage points, and fav orable mix.\n\n## SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $5,142 in 2024 increased $956 compared with 2023 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.8 percentage points to 29.4 percent, reflecting the impact of the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition, partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $4,186 in 2023 increased $572 compared with 2022 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.4 percentage points to 27.6 percent, reflecting the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and higher stock compensation expense of $125, of which $75 related to Emerson stock plans due to a higher share price and $50 was attributable to AspenTech stock plans. These items were partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\n## SALE OF COPELAND NOTE RECEIVABLE AND EQUITY INTEREST\n\nOn June 6, 2024, the Company entered into definitiv e agreements to sell its 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to priv ate equity funds managed by Blackstone for $1.5 billion and its note receiv able to Copeland for $1.9 billion, and the transactions were subsequently completed in August 2024. Upon entering into the note agreement, the Company recorded a pretax loss in continuing operations of $279 ($217 after-tax, $0.38 per share) to adjust the carrying v alue of the note to $1.9 billion to reflect the transaction price, while the Company recognized a gain of $539 ($435 after-tax) in discontinued operations upon the sale of the common equity interest. In addition, the equity method losses related to the Company's non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland, which were reported since May 2023 in Other deductions, net, hav e been reclassified and are now reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\n\n## GAIN ON SUBORDINATED INTEREST\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company receiv ed a distribution of $438 related to its subordinated interest in Vertiv  (in total, a pretax gain of $453 was recognized in the first quarter of 2022, $358 after-tax, $0.60 per share) and receiv ed the remaining $15 related to the pretax gain in the first quarter of 2023. In 2023, the Company receiv ed additional distributions totaling $161 ($122 after-tax, $0.21 per share) and in 2024, receiv ed its final distribution of $79 ($60 after-tax, $0.10 per share).\n\n## OTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET\n\nOther deductions, net were $1,434 in 2024, an increase of $928 compared with 2023. The current year included intangibles amortization related to the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition of $560, while restructuring costs increased by $156 and acquisition/div estiture costs increased by $27. The Company also incurred div estiture losses of $48 ($50 after-tax, $0.09 per share).\n\nOther deductions, net were $506 in 2023, a decrease of $13 compared with 2022, and included higher intangibles amortization of $146 primarily related to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and an unfav orable impact from foreign currency transactions of $112 reflecting losses in the current year compared to gains in the prior year. The prior year included a charge of $145 related to the Company exiting its business in Russia compared to a charge of $47 in",

      "answer": "The transition from the 2014 Plan to the 2023 Plan coincided with a decrease in the number of shares issued from Treasury stock, from 2,497,799 shares in 2023 under the 2014 Plan to 1,972,037 shares in 2024 under the 2023 Plan. This indicates that the adoption of the new plan did not immediately lead to an increase in equity awards issued, and may suggest a more conservative approach to stock-based compensation in the first year of the new plan. Additionally, the 2023 Plan had 42,500,000 shares authorized, with 40,873,176 remaining available as of December 31, 2024, showing that only a small portion of the new plan\u2019s capacity was utilized in its first year.",

      "question": "How did the change in UPS's unfunded commitments to private debt funds from 2023 ($3.3 billion) to 2024 ($2.7 billion) reflect the company's evolving investment strategy as measured through net asset value (NAV) adjustments?",
      "answer": "In 2023, UPS had unfunded commitments to private debt and other limited partnership funds totaling approximately $3.3 billion, which decreased to $2.7 billion by 2024. This reduction of $600 million suggests a strategic shift or rebalancing in UPS's pension fund investments, particularly in alternative assets like private debt. The company continued to rely on NAV as a practical expedient to value these illiquid investments, including private debt funds, based on audited financial reports from fund managers. The decline in unfunded commitments indicates a more conservative posture or a fulfillment of earlier commitments, potentially reflecting a response to market conditions or internal risk management adjustments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS(2023) \u2192 NAV: UPS used estimated net asset value (NAV) to value its U.S. pension plan investments, including $9.9 billion in hedge funds, private debt, private equity, and real estate as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Hop 2: NAV \u2192 Private Debt: Private debt investments were subject to NAV valuation methods, with unfunded commitments totaling $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Hop 3: Private Debt \u2190 UPS(2024): In 2024, UPS continued to use NAV for valuing private debt investments, but unfunded commitments dropped to $2.7 billion, indicating a reduction in planned future capital contributions."

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

      "answer": "FDX's 2023 operations in the Caribbean (FDX_10k_2023.pdf:page_43:chunk_3) positioned the company in a region where, as stated in the 2023 regulatory context (F_10k_2023.pdf:page_14:chunk_1), Mexico and most countries in Central America, the Caribbean, and South America were evolving to implement more stringent requirements aligned with European and U.S. emission standards, including Stage VI. By 2024, FDX's exposure to these regulations was explicitly noted in its 10-K filing (FDX_10k_2024.pdf:page_38:chunk_1), which warned of increased regulatory risks tied to environmental and emission standards, particularly in international markets. This evolution introduced operational risks such as compliance costs, potential service disruptions, and the need for fleet modernization to meet Stage VI requirements, which were expected to increase the complexity and cost of operating in the region.",

          "chunk_text": "distributed throughout the world, there are concentrations of key assets within our networks that are exposed to adverse weather conditions or localized risks from natural or manmade disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes, wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, severe winter weather, heat waves, extended droughts, conflicts or unrest, terrorist attacks, or other disturbances, actual or threatened. Additionally, shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change could increase the frequency, severity, or duration of certain adverse weather conditions. We may experience reduced availability and/or increases in the cost of insurance due to such changes. Prolonged interruptions or disruptions at a key location such as our FedEx Memphis World Hub or one of our information-technology centers could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also may incur significant costs to reestablish or relocate these functions. Moreover, resulting economic dislocations, including supply chain and fuel disruptions, could adversely affect demand for our services resulting in an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n## Other Legal, Regulatory, and Miscellaneous Risks\n\nGovernment regulation and enforcement are evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business. We are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. government regulations, laws, policies, and actions. There can be no assurance that such regulations, laws, policies, and actions will not be changed in ways that will decrease the demand for our services, subject us to escalating costs, or require us to modify our business models and objectives (such as our DRIVE transformation program, including Network 2.0), harming our financial results. In particular, legislative, regulatory, or other actions that U.S. and non-U.S. governments have undertaken or could take in areas such as data privacy and sovereignty, the use of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies, taxes, foreign ex change intervention in response to currency volatility, currency controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdictions, trade controls, tariffs, quotas, embargoes, or sanctions in the U.S. or other countries, complex  economic sanctions, import and ex port controls, customs standards, additional security or workplace and transportation health and safety requirements, labor and employment standards (including with respect to our pilots), worker classification, joint employment and benefits, government contracting, antitrust, regulated commodities, environmental, climate-related, or emission standards, and accounting may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, effective tax rate, and service levels. Furthermore, some of our operations are in high-risk legal compliance environments, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the 'FCPA'), similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and other compliance-related laws or regulations could result in litigation, assessment of damages, imposition of penalties, or other consequences. For additional discussion, see 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report under the caption 'Regulation.' Additionally, in light of the recently held and upcoming elections in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions, there is considerable uncertainty regarding reforms of various aspects of ex isting laws, regulations, and enforcement priorities and strategies that could affect trade policies, labor matters, tax es, and technological advancements, among other areas, and have a material effect on our business and results of operations, as well as on the price of our common stock.\n\nWe could be subject to adverse changes in regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions. We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, changes in tax  laws or regulations may be enacted that could significantly affect our overall tax  liabilities and our effective tax rate. U.S. and foreign governmental agencies maintain focus on the taxation of multinational companies, including statutory tax rates, digital tax es, global minimum taxes (such as the framework agreed to by members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), and transactions between affiliated companies. Such changes may require new and complex computations to be performed, significant judgments, estimates, and calculations to be made, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced.\n\nStandard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of certain tax laws and regulations will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation, and we may be required to make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition-Results of Operations and Outlook -Consolidated Results-Income Taxes' of this Annual Report for additional information regarding ongoing tax examinations and challenges.

      "question": "How did RTX's strategic positioning in the PW1100G-JM engine program through IAE LLC evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of its net program share after sub-collaborator adjustments?",
      "answer": "In 2023, RTX's subsidiary Pratt & Whitney held a 59% ownership interest in IAE LLC, but its net program share interest after considering sub-collaborator involvement was 51%. By 2024, this net program share interest remained at 51%, indicating that sub-collaborator participation in the PW1100G-JM engine program remained stable despite RTX's ongoing role in coordinating design, development, and manufacturing. This suggests that RTX's strategic positioning in the program remained consistent year-over-year, with collaborators continuing to play a significant role in the economics of the program.",

      "answer": "In 2023, UPS's U.S. pension and postretirement medical benefit plans held $9.9 billion in alternative investments, including private equity funds, which were valued using NAV based on financial reports from fund managers with subjective adjustments. By 2024, UPS continued to use NAV as a practical expedient for valuing private equity funds, but the company disclosed $2.7 billion in unfunded commitments expected to be contributed over the next 3 to 6 years. This indicates that UPS not only maintained its reliance on NAV for valuation but also increased its long-term commitment to private equity as part of the pension plan\u2019s investment strategy, despite the challenges in determining fair value for these illiquid assets.",

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS disclosed that there were 732 shares of Class B common stock issued (Class B common stock line item in the equity section), but no shares of Class B common stock were authorized for issuance under the LTIP, as the program primarily used Class A common stock for equity awards. By 2023, UPS began valuing LTIP awards tied to Class B common stock using a Monte Carlo model, with the weighted-average grant date fair value of Restricted Units for Class B stock at $185.66 per unit for 2023 awards. This indicates a shift in strategy where UPS started formally incorporating Class B common stock into LTIP awards, moving from exclusive reliance on Class A stock to utilizing Class B shares with more complex valuation methods, potentially aligning executive compensation more closely with long-term shareholder value creation.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing recorded a $402 million reach-forward loss on the KC-46A Tanker program due to factory and supply chain disruptions, including the impact of evolving customer requirements for the Remote Vision System. These disruptions, rooted in fixed-price contract risks, created significant estimation uncertainty that persisted into 2024. By 2024, auditors identified continued challenges in estimating final costs for the KC-46A program, citing supply chain inefficiencies and operational complexities as key risk factors. The 2024 audit process involved extensive scrutiny of cost projections and required specialized expertise to evaluate Boeing\u2019s margin estimates, indicating that the earlier disruptions materially increased audit risk and continued to pressure margin projections. This shows a clear causal chain: 2022 production issues \u2192 persistent cost estimation risks \u2192 increased financial and audit scrutiny in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Revenues\n\nBDS revenues in 2021 increased by $283 million compared with 2020 primarily due to higher revenue on the KC-46A Tanker program due to new orders for 27 aircraft received during the first quarter of 2021 and lower charges in 2021. This was partially offset by lower revenues on rotorcraft programs, Commercial Crew and VC-25B. Cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2021 were $56 million less unfavorable than the prior year, largely due to the lower charges described below.\n\nBDS revenues in 2020 increased by $162 million compared with 2019 reflecting higher revenues from fighter aircraft, Space Launch System, B-52 upgrades, proprietary and MQ-25, partially offset by reduced volume in missile defense. These net increases were offset by the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $312 million  higher  than  the  comparable  period  in  the  prior  year,  largely  due  to  the  KC-46A Tanker  charges  during 2020.\n\n## Earnings From Operations\n\nBDS earnings from operations in 2021 increased by $5 million compared with 2020 primarily due to less unfavorable impacts from cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which improved $219 million from the prior year, largely due to lower KC-46A Tanker charges in 2021 compared to 2020 and other charges in development programs described below. The favorable change in cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was offset primarily by lower volume and mix on rotorcraft programs and lower equity earnings for United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nDuring  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  increased  the  reach-forward  loss  on  the  KC-46A  Tanker  program  by $402 million primarily due to continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved.  In  2020,  we  recorded  an  additional  reach-forward  loss  of  $1,320  million  on  the  KC-46A  Tanker  program reflecting $551 million of costs associated",

The U.S. government contracting party  may  modify,  curtail  or  terminate  its  contracts  and  subcontracts  with  us,  without  prior  notice  and  either  at  its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such  as  'continuing  resolutions'  rather  than  full-year  appropriations.  Any  loss  or  anticipated  loss  or  reduction  of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable  under  U.S.  government  contracts. U.S.  government  agencies,  including  the  Defense  Contract  Audit Agency  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency,  routinely  audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.\n\n## We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.\n\nOur BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 68% and 69% of their 2021 revenues from fixed-price contracts.  While  fixed-price  contracts  enable  us  to  benefit  from  performance  improvements,  cost  reductions  and efficiencies,  they  also  subject  us  to  the  risk  of  reduced  margins  or  incurring  losses  if  we  are  unable  to  achieve estimated costs and revenues. In addition, increased compliance costs and costs due to loss of productivity due to COVID-19 may not be reimbursed. If  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  price,  we  recognize  reach-forward losses  which  can  significantly  affect  our  reported  results.  For  example  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  recorded additional losses of $402 million on the KC-46A Tanker contract reflecting continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the  process  of  estimating  costs  and  revenues  on  fixed-price  contracts  inherently  risky.  Fixed-price  contracts  often contain  price  incentives  and  penalties  tied  to  performance,  which  can  be  difficult  to  estimate  and  have  significant impacts  on  margins.  In  addition,  some  of  our  contracts  have  specific  provisions  relating  to  cost,  schedule  and performance.\n\nFixed-price  development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  Examples  of  significant  BDS  fixed-price  development  contracts include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military satellites.",

The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and rev enue is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin at completion. The process of estimating margin at completion inv olv es estimating the costs to  complete  production  of  goods  or  rendering  of  serv ices  and  comparing  those  costs  to  the  estimated  final  rev enue  amount.  Margins  on  fixed-price development contracts are inherently uncertain in that rev enue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant  v ariability.  T he  operational  and  technical  complexities  of  fixed-price  dev elopment  contracts  create  financial  risk,  which  could  increase  the estimates  of  costs  and  result  in  lower  margins  or  material  reach-forward  losses.  T he  ongoing  effects  of  supply  chain  and  operational  inefficiencies compound these complexities and related financial risks.\n\nGiven  the  operational  and  technical  complexities  of  certain  of  the  Company's  fixed-price  dev elopment  contracts,  including  the  KC-46A  T anker, Commercial  Crew ,  VC-25B  Presidential Aircraft,  T -7A  Redhawk,  and  MQ-25  contracts  and  the  limited  amount  of  historical  data  av ailable  in  certain instances and significant judgments necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates inv olv ed extensiv e audit effort, a high degree of auditor judgment, and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the cost estimates for the KC-46A T anker, Commercial Crew , VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, T-7A Redhawk, and MQ-25 fixed-price dev elopment contracts included the following, among others:\n\n- We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods used in dev eloping its cost estimates.\n- We evaluated the reasonableness of judgments made and significant assumptions used by management relating to key cost and schedule estimates, including the effects of supply chain and labor disruptions.  We also ev aluated the range and probabilities of reasonably possible outcomes, and where management set its point estimate within the range.\n- We evaluated the appropriateness of the timing of the incorporation of changes to key cost estimates, including ev aluating the timeline of key events and knowledge points that led to management's determination that a change in estimate was necessary.\n- We inquired of project management, engineers, supply chain leadership, and others directly inv olv ed with the execution of contracts to ev aluate management's ability to achiev e the key",

      "answer": "In 2023, RTX's subsidiary Pratt & Whitney held a 49.5% ownership interest in IAE, which was responsible for coordinating the V2500 engine program. Additionally, Pratt & Whitney had a 59% program share interest and ownership stake in IAE LLC, which focused on the PW1100G-JM engine for the Airbus A320neo family. By 2024, this structure remained consistent, with Pratt & Whitney maintaining its 59% stake in IAE LLC, which directly influenced its ability to drive the design, development, and supply chain coordination of the PW1100G-JM engine. The consolidation of IAE and IAE LLC as variable interest entities with Pratt & Whitney as the primary beneficiary ensured that RTX retained strategic control over the engine programs, enabling continuity in product support and manufacturing alignment with partners MTU and JAEC.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GD was awarded a contract worth $X million for the construction of three Flight III DDG-51 destroyers, which contributed to the company's Marine Systems segment backlog. By 2024, this contract had been integrated into GD\u2019s production planning, with the DDG-51 destroyers now included in a broader backlog of 11 ships scheduled for delivery through 2032. This indicates that the 2023 contract award directly contributed to extending GD\u2019s production timeline and increasing the volume of DDG-51 destroyers under construction, demonstrating a clear link between contract acquisition and long-term production commitments.",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million. The following table summarizes the effect of foreign ex change cash flow hedges on AOCI:\n\n",

Supplier Finance Program Obligations\n\nUnder supplier finance programs, 3M agrees to pay participating banks the stated amount of confirmed invoices from its designated suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices, generally within 90 days of the invoice date. 3M or the banks may terminate the agreements with advance notice. Separately, the banks may have arrangements with the suppliers that provide them the option to request early payment from the banks for invoices confirmed by 3M. 3M's outstanding balances of confirmed invoices in the programs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. These amounts are included within accounts payable on 3M's consolidated balance sheet. The activity in 2024 included approximately $1.5 billion of invoices confirmed and $1.5 billion of invoices paid and other adjustments.\n\n## NOTE 17. Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3M's financial position and performance.\n\nAdditional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:\n\n- Impact on other comprehensive income of non-derivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 9.\n- Fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 18.\n- Derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company's long-term debt are also described in Note 14.\n\nRefer to the section below titled Location on Statement of Income (Loss) and Impact of Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments for details on the location within the consolidated statements of income (loss) for amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow or fair value hedges (along with similar information relative to the hedged items) and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Additional information relative to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included below as applicable.\n\nCash Flow Hedges: For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts: The Company may enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of ex change rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The Company may de-designate a cash flow hedge if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable, if 3M determines that the hedge is no longer expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction, or in certain other circumstances. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income for de-designated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in the value of derivative instruments after de-designation are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments section below. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Interest Rate Contracts: The Company may use forward starting interest rate contracts and treasury rate lock contracts to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments on forecasted debt issuances.\n\nThe amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the gain/(loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had a balance of $15 million associated with the after-tax net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). This includes a remaining balance of $80 million (after-tax loss) related to forward starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock contracts terminated in 2019 concurrent with associated debt issuances, which is being amortized over the respective lives of the underlying notes. Based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, of the total after-tax net unrealized balance as of December 31, 2024, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $44 million after-tax  net unrealized gain over the nex t 12 months (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).",

      "answer": "In 2023, Lockheed Martin's Space segment operating profit included its share of earnings from the investment in ULA, which provides expendable launch services. While the exact ULA-related earnings for 2023 are not quantified, the Space segment's profitability was influenced by this investment. In 2024, the Space segment again reported operating results that included ULA earnings, but despite a $1.0 billion (6%) increase in overall net sales and a $56 million (3%) increase in operating profit for the RMS segment, the Space segment specifically faced challenges from profit booking rate adjustments. The decrease in profit booking rate adjustments in 2024 compared to 2023\u2014partially due to unfavorable adjustments on the Seahawk production program\u2014likely impacted the Space segment's ability to fully capitalize on ULA's performance. This suggests that while ULA remained a strategic asset, internal program adjustments constrained the direct profitability uplift from expendable launch services in 2024 relative to 2023.",

      "answer": "The increase in issued Class B shares from 726 in 2023 to 733 in 2024, under a structure where each Class B share carries 15 votes, slightly shifted the governance balance by increasing the aggregate voting power of Class B shareholders. In 2023, 726 Class B shares \u00d7 15 votes = 10,890 votes. In 2024, this increased to 733 \u00d7 15 = 10,995 votes.

      "question": "How did the redemption of Series B Preferred Stock in 2023 impact the structure of voting rights in 2024, particularly in relation to the earlier redemption schedule outlined in 2023 filings?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Honeywell completed the full redemption of its Series B Preferred Stock through a series of partial redemptions totaling $620 million, including $211 million in December 2021, $197 million in February 2022, and $212 million in June 2022. These redemptions were governed by the Amended Certificate of Designation, which outlined mandatory redemption schedules tied to EBITDA thresholds and liquidity availability. The Series B Preferred Stock carried limited voting rights, applicable only in specific corporate events such as mergers or changes to stock terms. With the full redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock by mid-2022, these voting rights were effectively eliminated by 2024. In 2024, the capital structure was simplified to only common stock, with common shareholders entitled to one vote per share and no preferential voting rights, reflecting a transformation in the governance structure following the removal of preferred stock classes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: HON(2023) \u2192 Series B Preferred Stock: Honeywell disclosed the full redemption of $620 million in Series B Preferred Stock through multiple tranches in 2021 and 2022, governed by EBITDA and liquidity conditions.",
        "Hop 2: Series B Preferred Stock \u2192 Voting Rights: Series B holders had limited voting rights, applicable only in specific corporate events such as mergers or changes to stock terms.",
        "Hop 3: Voting Rights \u2190 HON(2024): By 2024, Series B Preferred Stock was no longer outstanding, and the capital structure was simplified to common stock, with all voting rights now held by common shareholders on a one-share-one-vote basis."

      "question": "How did Boeing's financial exposure to cost overruns on Fixed-Price Development Contracts like Commercial Crew in 2022 influence the revenue recognition patterns and contract accounting methods used in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing faced significant financial exposure due to cost overruns on Fixed-Price Development Contracts, including the Commercial Crew program, which led to the recognition of reach-forward losses when estimated costs exceeded contract prices. For example, Boeing recorded a $402 million loss on the KC-46A Tanker contract due to supply chain disruptions and evolving customer requirements. These contracts, particularly development ones, were inherently uncertain due to fixed revenue and variable cost estimates. By 2023, Boeing continued to use cost-incurred-based revenue recognition for long-term contracts, especially in the BDS segment, where Commercial Crew and similar programs were accounted for under program accounting. Auditing and internal controls focused heavily on the accuracy of cost estimates and margin projections, especially for high-risk contracts like Commercial Crew, where changes in cost estimates could significantly affect margins and financial statements. The 2023 accounting policies reflected a continuation of practices shaped by the prior year's challenges in managing fixed-price development risk.",

The U.S. government contracting party  may  modify,  curtail  or  terminate  its  contracts  and  subcontracts  with  us,  without  prior  notice  and  either  at  its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such  as  'continuing  resolutions'  rather  than  full-year  appropriations.  Any  loss  or  anticipated  loss  or  reduction  of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable  under  U.S.  government  contracts. U.S.  government  agencies,  including  the  Defense  Contract  Audit Agency  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency,  routinely  audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.\n\n## We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.\n\nOur BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 68% and 69% of their 2021 revenues from fixed-price contracts.  While  fixed-price  contracts  enable  us  to  benefit  from  performance  improvements,  cost  reductions  and efficiencies,  they  also  subject  us  to  the  risk  of  reduced  margins  or  incurring  losses  if  we  are  unable  to  achieve estimated costs and revenues. In addition, increased compliance costs and costs due to loss of productivity due to COVID-19 may not be reimbursed. If  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  price,  we  recognize  reach-forward losses  which  can  significantly  affect  our  reported  results.  For  example  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  recorded additional losses of $402 million on the KC-46A Tanker contract reflecting continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the  process  of  estimating  costs  and  revenues  on  fixed-price  contracts  inherently  risky.  Fixed-price  contracts  often contain  price  incentives  and  penalties  tied  to  performance,  which  can  be  difficult  to  estimate  and  have  significant impacts  on  margins.  In  addition,  some  of  our  contracts  have  specific  provisions  relating  to  cost,  schedule  and performance.\n\nFixed-price  development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  Examples  of  significant  BDS  fixed-price  development  contracts include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military satellites.",

The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin  at  completion.  The  process  of  estimating  margin  at  completion  involves  estimating  the  costs  to  complete production of goods or rendering of services and comparing those costs to the estimated final revenue amount. Fixedprice development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant variability. Due to the technical performance requirements in many of these  contracts,  changes  to  cost  and  revenue  estimates  could  occur,  resulting  in  lower  margins  or  material  reachforward losses.\n\nGiven  the  complexity  of  certain  of  the  Company's  fixed-price  development  contracts,  including  the  KC-46A  Tanker, Commercial Crew, and United States Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft contracts, the limited amount of historical data available in certain instances and significant judgments necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the cost estimates for the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, and United States Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft fixed-price development contracts included the following, among others:\n\n- We  evaluated  the  appropriateness  and  consistency  of  management's  methods  used  in  developing  its estimates.\n- We  evaluated  the  reasonableness  of  judgments  made  and  significant  assumptions  used  by  management relating to key cost and schedule estimates, including the range and probability of reasonable outcomes, and the appropriateness of the timing of changes to key estimates.\n- We performed inquiries of the Company's project managers and others directly involved with the contracts to evaluate  management's ability  to  achieve  the  key  cost  and  schedule  estimates,  as  well  as  evaluate  project status and project challenges which may affect total estimated costs to complete. We also observed the project work site when key estimates related to tangible or physical progress of the project.\n- We  tested  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  key  data  used  in  developing  estimates.  We  developed independent  expectations  of  reasonable  outcomes  using,  in  part,  the  program's  data  and  compared  our expectations to management's estimates.\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over the review of judgments made and significant assumptions used to develop  key  estimates,  including  controls  over  the  key  data  used  in  developing  the  estimates  and  the mathematical extrapolation of such data.\n- We performed retrospective reviews, comparing actual performance to estimated performance and the related financial  statement  impact,  including  the  appropriateness  of  the  timing  of  changes  to  key  estimates,  when evaluating the thoroughness and precision of management's estimation process and effectiveness of related internal controls.",

The 2024 SG&A expenses showed a $125 million increase in stock compensation, with $50 million directly attributable to AspenTech plans.

Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis). AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech's prev ious name 'Aspen Technology, Inc.' and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under AspenTech's previous stock ticker symbol 'AZPN.' Due to the timing of the acquisition, the results for the first half of fiscal 2022 do not include the results of Heritage AspenTech.\n\nSee Notes 4, 5 and 8 and Item 1A - \"Risk Factors\" for further information on acquisitions and div estitures.\n\n## COST OF SALES\n\nCost of sales for 2024 were $8,607, an increase of $869 compared with $7,738 in 2023, reflecting the impact of higher v olume and the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition. Gross profit was $8,885 in 2024 compared to $7,427 in 2023, while gross margin increased 1.8 percentage points to 50.8 percent, reflecting the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition and higher price partially offset by the impact from acquisition-related inv entory step-up amortization of $231, which negativ ely impacted margins by approximately 1.3 percentage points.\n\nCost of sales for 2023 were $7,738, an increase of $240 compared with $7,498 in 2022. Gross profit was $7,427 in 2023 compared to $6,306 in 2022, while gross margin increased 3.3 percentage points to 49.0 percent due to fav orable price less net material inflation, the impact of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition which benefited margins by 0.6 percentage points, and fav orable mix.\n\n## SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $5,142 in 2024 increased $956 compared with 2023 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.8 percentage points to 29.4 percent, reflecting the impact of the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition, partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $4,186 in 2023 increased $572 compared with 2022 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.4 percentage points to 27.6 percent, reflecting the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and higher stock compensation expense of $125, of which $75 related to Emerson stock plans due to a higher share price and $50 was attributable to AspenTech stock plans. These items were partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\n## SALE OF COPELAND NOTE RECEIVABLE AND EQUITY INTEREST\n\nOn June 6, 2024, the Company entered into definitiv e agreements to sell its 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to priv ate equity funds managed by Blackstone for $1.5 billion and its note receiv able to Copeland for $1.9 billion, and the transactions were subsequently completed in August 2024. Upon entering into the note agreement, the Company recorded a pretax loss in continuing operations of $279 ($217 after-tax, $0.38 per share) to adjust the carrying v alue of the note to $1.9 billion to reflect the transaction price, while the Company recognized a gain of $539 ($435 after-tax) in discontinued operations upon the sale of the common equity interest.

          "chunk_text": "\n(a)    Pending completion of our December 31, 2024 statutory reporting process.\n\nStructured settlement annuities. We reinsure approximately 23,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 57. A pproximately 27% of these structured settlement annuities were underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than-average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment). Unlike long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nLife Insurance contracts. Our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. A t December 31, 2024, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance portfolio, we reinsure approximately $45 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.1 million policies with an average attained age of 63. In 2024, our incurred claims were approximately $0.4 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $46,100. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20- and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20- and 30-year level term policies, which represent approximately 7% and 43% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2026 and 2035 as the policies reach the end of their 20- and 30-year level premium period, respectively.\n\nCritical Accounting E stimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums and are estimated based on actuarial assumptions such as mortality, morbidity, terminations, and expenses. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings. Our annual review procedures include updating certain experience studies since our last completed review, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. The review of experience and assumptions is a comprehensive and complex process that depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. The review relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance portfolio includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing disclosed that fixed-price development contracts, particularly the KC-46A Tanker, were subject to significant cost overruns, with $402 million in additional losses recorded in Q4 2021 due to factory disruptions, supply chain impacts, and evolving customer requirements. By 2024, despite continued efforts to manage cost estimates, Boeing still faced substantial financial risk from these contracts, compounded by ongoing supply chain and labor disruptions.

The U.S. government contracting party  may  modify,  curtail  or  terminate  its  contracts  and  subcontracts  with  us,  without  prior  notice  and  either  at  its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such  as  'continuing  resolutions'  rather  than  full-year  appropriations.  Any  loss  or  anticipated  loss  or  reduction  of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable  under  U.S.  government  contracts. U.S.  government  agencies,  including  the  Defense  Contract  Audit Agency  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency,  routinely  audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.\n\n## We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.\n\nOur BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 68% and 69% of their 2021 revenues from fixed-price contracts.  While  fixed-price  contracts  enable  us  to  benefit  from  performance  improvements,  cost  reductions  and efficiencies,  they  also  subject  us  to  the  risk  of  reduced  margins  or  incurring  losses  if  we  are  unable  to  achieve estimated costs and revenues. In addition, increased compliance costs and costs due to loss of productivity due to COVID-19 may not be reimbursed. If  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  price,  we  recognize  reach-forward losses  which  can  significantly  affect  our  reported  results.  For  example  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  recorded additional losses of $402 million on the KC-46A Tanker contract reflecting continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the  process  of  estimating  costs  and  revenues  on  fixed-price  contracts  inherently  risky.  Fixed-price  contracts  often contain  price  incentives  and  penalties  tied  to  performance,  which  can  be  difficult  to  estimate  and  have  significant impacts  on  margins.  In  addition,  some  of  our  contracts  have  specific  provisions  relating  to  cost,  schedule  and performance.\n\nFixed-price  development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  Examples  of  significant  BDS  fixed-price  development  contracts include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military satellites.",

Fixedprice development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant variability.

      "question": "How did the use of valuation models in UPS's 2022 market risk disclosures relate to the specific characteristics of their private equity fund investments described in the 2023 filing, particularly regarding valuation transparency and redemption terms?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UPS disclosed using valuation models to assess market risk exposures across financial instruments, particularly emphasizing sensitivity analyses that incorporated observable and unobservable inputs for derivatives and investment valuations. By 2023, UPS reported holding private equity fund investments valued using NAV per partnership audited financial reports, noting that these funds had terms typically ranging from 10 to 15 years with limited redemption provisions until the end of the term. The 2023 filing also highlighted that these private equity funds lacked readily determinable fair values and relied on unobservable inputs that could not be corroborated using standard market data. This suggests that while UPS continued to rely on internal valuation models (consistent with 2022 disclosures), the nature of private equity investments introduced challenges in valuation transparency and liquidity management, as evidenced by the $3.3 billion in unfunded commitments expected to be funded over 3\u20136 years.",

          "chunk_text": "## UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we may utilize a variety of commodity, foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate forward contracts, options and swaps. A discussion of our accounting policy for derivative instruments is provided in note 1 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nWe are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel and unleaded gasoline, as well as changes in the price of natural gas and other alternative fuels. Currently, the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes. In order to mitigate the impact of fuel surcharges imposed on us by outside carriers, we regularly adjust the rates we charge for our freight brokerage services. The majority of our contracts for fuel purchases utilize index-based pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locational/supplier differential. While many of the indices are aligned, each index may fluctuate at a different pace, driving variability in the prices paid for fuel. Because of this, our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges, which can significantly affect our results either positively or negatively in the short-term. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no commodity contracts outstanding.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi and Hong Kong Dollar. We may use forward contracts as well as a combination of purchased and written options to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 48 months. We also utilize forward contracts to hedge portions of our anticipated cash settlements of intercompany transactions and interest payments on certain debt subject to foreign currency remeasurement.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nWe have issued debt instruments and debt associated with finance leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. We may also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances. Our floating-rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short-term interest rates.\n\nWe also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods.\n\nWe have investments in debt securities, as well as cash-equivalent instruments, some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest. Additionally, we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest.\n\n## Sensitivity Analysis\n\nThe following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non-linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts.",

Class A shares were primarily held by employees, retirees, and founder-related trusts, and were fully convertible into Class B shares at any time. By 2023, the authorized share counts remained unchanged, but the actual issuance and conversion activity likely shifted due to employee share conversions and market dynamics. The structure of voting rights and convertibility remained consistent across both years, indicating a stable framework for capital control and shareholder influence through the Class A to Class B share relationship.",

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin\u2019s investment in ULA decreased from $585 million in 2022 to $551 million in 2024, indicating a reduced direct financial stake in the joint venture. However, during the same period, ULA expanded its role as a supplier of expendable launch services to both the U.S. Government and commercial customers. This broader commercial orientation of ULA aligns with Lockheed Martin\u2019s increased direct financial exposure to commercial customers in 2024, as evidenced by $665 million in receivables from commercial customers and a contract asset base of $55.6 billion, which includes advance payments from non-U.S. government clients. Therefore, while LMT\u2019s equity investment in ULA declined, its indirect exposure to commercial markets through ULA\u2019s expanded customer base and its own direct commercial receivables increased, suggesting a strategic shift toward greater commercial market engagement.",
