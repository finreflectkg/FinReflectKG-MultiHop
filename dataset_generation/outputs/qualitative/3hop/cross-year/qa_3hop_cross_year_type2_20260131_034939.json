      "question": "How did CMCSA's strategy around shared data plans evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of their positioning within bundled service offerings and the range of payment or plan options available to customers?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, CMCSA consistently offered shared data plans as part of its wireless service bundles for residential customers who subscribed to broadband services. In 2022, customers could choose from unlimited data plans, shared data plans, or per-gigabyte plans, with device financing options over 24 months. In 2023, the company maintained this structure, offering shared data plans alongside unlimited and per-gigabyte options, with similar device financing terms. By 2024, CMCSA expanded its domestic wireless offerings by introducing prepaid unlimited data plans under the NOW brand, while continuing to offer shared data plans. This evolution shows a strategic expansion in 2024 to include more flexible and prepaid options, while maintaining shared data plans as a core part of bundled offerings across all three years.",

      "question": "How did the competitive positioning of CMCSA against wireless telecommunications companies evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of the technologies and strategies these wireless competitors leveraged to challenge CMCSA's broadband and wireless services?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, CMCSA's competitive landscape with wireless telecommunications companies intensified, marked by a clear evolution in the technological offerings and bundling strategies of these competitors. In 2022, wireless companies were primarily noted for offering 4G and 5G wireless broadband services that competed directly with CMCSA's broadband services. By 2023, the competitive pressure increased as wireless providers began deploying 5G fixed wireless networks, which offered more robust home internet solutions using technologies like wireless routers and data cards, directly challenging CMCSA's residential broadband segment. In 2024, the trend escalated further, with wireless companies leveraging not only 5G fixed wireless but also bundling their services with unlimited data-usage plans and exclusive DTC streaming content, creating more integrated and attractive offerings for consumers. This multi-year progression shows a strategic shift from standalone wireless broadband offerings to more sophisticated, bundled, and content-enhanced services that directly undermined CMCSA's competitive positioning in both broadband and wireless markets.",

We compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, sports, news and information content to consumers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.\n\nBelow is a summary of our most significant sources of competition. Many of these competitors offer competitive pricing, packaging and/or bundling of services to customers, which further increases competition. For a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the 'Competition' discussion within that section.\n\n- Connectivity  &amp;  Platforms'  broadband  services  compete  primarily  against  wireline  telecommunications  companies,  including  many  that  are  increasing deployment of fiber-based networks; wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services (using a variety of technologies, including 5G  fixed wireless networks and 4G  and 5G  wireless broadband services); electric cooperatives and municipalities in the United States that own and operate their own broadband networks; and DBS and newer satellite broadband providers. Broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level may result in other service providers deploying new subsidized internet access networks within our footprint, and in cases where we receive subsidies, may impose constraints on how we conduct our businesses. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see '-We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses' below and Item 1: Business and refer to the 'Legislation and Regulation' discussion within that section.\n- Our wireless and voice services compete with both telecommunications and wireless telecommunication providers.\n- Competition for video services consists primarily of DTC streaming service providers and aggregators, DBS providers and telecommunications companies.\n- Business Services Connectivity primarily competes with wireline telecommunications companies and wide area network managed service providers.\n- Our businesses in Content &amp; Experiences, as well as our video business, face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of entertainment, sports, news and information content, as well as from other forms of entertainment, including from social networking and user-generated content,  as  well  as  tourism,  recreational  activities  and  lodging.  They  must  compete  to  obtain  talent,  popular  content  (including  sports  programming), advertising and other resources required to successfully operate their businesses. This competition has further intensified as certain DTC streaming service providers have commissioned, and may continue to commission, high-cost programming and acquire live sports programming rights to attract viewers at significant costs.\n\nCompetitors with significant resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing and packaging continue to increasingly compete with our businesses in all forms. Some of these competitors could also have preferential access to customer data or other competitive information. Further, consolidation of, or cooperation between, our competitors may increase competition in all of these areas. For example, cooperation between competitors may allow them to offer a range of products and services, including aggregating certain content into a stand-alone offering, offering free or lower cost DTC streaming services, potentially on an exclusive basis, through unlimited data-usage plans for broadband and wireless services or bundling DTC streaming services on their platforms.\n\nOur competitive position may be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience. In addition, our ability to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, business partners, employees, investors and government authorities. For example, some of these constituencies may have their own, and some have conflicting, environmental, social and governance priorities, which may present risks to our reputation and brands if these constituencies perceive misalignment.\n\n## Changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.\n\nDistribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content continue to challenge existing business models, increase the number of competitors that our businesses face, and have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much or for how long they pay for such content.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n18",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nBelow is a summary of the most significant sources of competition; for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the 'Competition' discussion within that section.\n\n- Cable Communications' and Sky's broadband services compete primarily against wireline telecommunications companies, including many that are increasing deployment of fiber-based networks, wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services (such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services), certain electric cooperatives and municipalities in the United  States  that  own  and  operate  their  own  broadband  networks  and  DBS  and  newer  satellite  broadband  providers. Broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level, including as part of COVID-19 relief efforts as well as federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021, may result in other service providers deploying new subsidized internet access networks within our footprint. Competition for Cable Communications' video services consists primarily of DTC streaming and other  OTT  service  providers,  DBS  providers  and  telecommunications  companies  with  fiber-based networks.  Sky  faces  competition  for  its  video  services  from  cable  and  telecommunications  providers  in  its  European markets.  Our  voice  and  wireless  services  primarily  compete  with  wireless  and  wireline  telecommunications  providers. Many  of  our  competitors  offer  customers  bundled  products  and  services  with  favorable  pricing,  which  has  increased competition.\n- NBCUniversal  and  Sky  face  substantial  and  increasing  competition  from  providers  of  similar  types  of  entertainment, sports,  news  and  information  content,  as  well  as  from  other  forms  of  entertainment  and  recreational  activities. NBCUniversal  and  Sky  must  compete  to  obtain  talent,  popular  content  (including  sports  programming)  and  other resources required to successfully operate their businesses. This competition has intensified as DTC streaming and other OTT service providers seek to develop high-quality programming and acquire live sports programming to attract viewers.\n\nConsolidation  of,  or  cooperation  between,  our  competitors,  including  suppliers  and  distributors  of  content,  may  increase competition in all of these areas, as may the emergence of additional competitors with significant resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing and packaging, who are competing with our businesses in all forms of content distribution and production. For example, such consolidation or cooperation may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost  streaming  services,  potentially  on  an  exclusive  basis,  through  unlimited  data-usage  plans  for  internet  or  wireless  phone services.\n\nThe  ability  of  our  businesses  to  compete  effectively  also  depends  on  our  perceived  image  and  reputation  among  our  various constituencies,  including  our  customers,  consumers,  advertisers,  business  partners,  employees,  investors  and  government authorities. In addition, our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience.\n\n## Changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.\n\nDistribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming and other OTT services, the number of Cable Communications' video customers and amount of subscriber fees paid to NBCUniversal's television networks decrease, even as Cable Communications' broadband services have become more important to consumers. DTC streaming and other OTT services have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much they pay for such content.\n\nFor  example,  Cable  Communications  continues  to  experience  net  video  customer  losses.  In  Europe,  more  of  Sky's  new  video customers  have  recently  subscribed,  and  may  continue  to  subscribe,  to  NOW,  Sky's  DTC  streaming  service,  instead  of  its traditional  DTH  video  service.  Although  we  have  attempted  to  adapt  our  video  service  offerings  and  enhance  our  broadband services for changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying the X1 and Sky Q platforms, Flex, developing new smart televisions using our global technology platform at Sky and Cable Communications, and by offering Peacock, the continuing trend of content owners delivering their content directly to consumers rather than through, or in addition to, traditional video distribution channels continues to disrupt traditional distribution business models.\n\nThe  increase  in  DTC  streaming  and  other  OTT  service  providers  also  has  significantly  increased  the  number  of  entertainment choices available to consumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers. The use of DTC streaming and other OTT services reduce traditional television viewership,  and  coupled  with  time-shifting  technologies,  such  as  DVR  and  on  demand  services,  have  caused  and  likely  will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our television programming channels. In addition, as more programming providers offer  their  content  directly  to  consumers  through  their  own  apps  or  platforms,  they  may  reduce  the  quantity  and  quality  of  the programming they license to NBCUniversal or Sky's television channels or to Peacock.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How did CMCSA's enterprise-level router management service offerings evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of integration with broader network services and support for large enterprises operating beyond CMCSA's core footprint?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA offered router management as part of its enterprise solutions, specifically targeting Fortune 1000 companies and large enterprises with multi-location needs, often extending coverage beyond its own service areas through third-party network agreements. By 2023, this service had become more integrated with advanced Wi-Fi solutions and network security offerings, especially for small business and enterprise customers in the U.S. and U.K., with an emphasis on business continuity and cloud-based services. In 2024, router management remained a core component of enterprise support, now more explicitly tied to software-defined networking and Ethernet services, continuing to serve large enterprises both within and outside of CMCSA\u2019s footprint through network-sharing agreements. The continuity in service scope and the deepening integration with broader connectivity and security services reflect a strategic evolution toward comprehensive enterprise networking solutions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Video\n\nWe offer video services to residential and business customers primarily through our X1 platform in the United States over our network, and through our Sky Q platform internationally in the United Kingdom and Italy using a combination of satellite transmission and broadband connections. X1 and Sky Q are cloud-based platforms that provide integrated search functionality leveraging set-top boxes and voice-activated remote controls. The integrated features operate across content in customers' video service packages and content from internet-based streaming services that customers may access in a manner similar to our Xumo Stream Box. We offer a range of video packages from basic linear service to full linear service, which typically include free-to-air networks and a range of other linear television networks including premium, sports and news networks. Our international video packages also include Sky-branded entertainment television networks that offer entertainment, premium movie and free-to-air programming, as well as Sky Sports networks that are part of our Media segment. Customers may also subscribe to digital video recorder ('DVR') services or access our video on demand services with programming that is available for no additional cost or to rent or buy digitally. These viewing options are also available through our mobile apps and online portals.\n\nWe also offer DTC streaming services marketed under the NOW brand, with an offering in the United States that launched in 2023. NOW services provide video content over the internet and do not require a set-top box. Our international NOW service offerings include packages for monthly access to entertainment, sports and movie programming, as well as daily pass options for sports programming.  Our domestic  NOW  TV  service is only offered to qualifying residential broadband customers  and  includes  monthly  access  to  a  variety  of  linear  television  networks;  entertainment  and  movie  programming;  integrated  access  to  free  streaming channels from Xumo Play, NBC and Sky; and access to the ad-supported tier of Peacock.\n\nWe also offer video services in the United Kingdom and Italy over a broadband connection without the need for a satellite dish. These services have an operating system similar to Sky Q and are offered to customers through Sky Stream, which leverages a streaming device and Wi-Fi, or to customers that purchase our Sky G lass smart televisions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nAs part of our distribution agreements with domestic cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that our advertising business sells, and we also sell advertising on our Sky-branded entertainment television networks and on our digital platforms. We also enter into representation agreements under which we sell advertising on behalf of third parties both domestically and internationally. Additionally, we offer technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate effective engagement of advertisers with their target audiences.\n\n## Other\n\nWe offer residential wireline voice services primarily using interconnected V oice over Internet Protocol ('V oIP') technology, and we offer residential security and automation  services.  We  also  license  our  technology  platforms  to  other  multichannel  video  providers  and  distribute  certain  of  our  Sky-branded  entertainment television networks to third-party video service providers.\n\n## Business Services Connectivity Segment\n\nOur Business Services Connectivity segment consists of our domestic service offerings for small businesses, which include broadband, wireline voice and wireless services, as well as our enterprise solutions offerings for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises. Certain business customers subscribe to our video services, and the associated revenue is included in our Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segment. We also have certain business connectivity service offerings in the United Kingdom.\n\nOur domestic broadband offerings have a range of service levels, including fiber-based services that deliver symmetrical speeds ranging up to 100 gigabits per second.\n\nOur small business broadband, wireline voice and wireless service offerings are similar to those provided to our residential customers and also include cloud-based cybersecurity services, wireless backup connectivity, advanced Wi-Fi solutions, video monitoring services and other cloud-based services.\n\nOur enterprise solutions offerings also include ethernet network services, which connect multiple locations and provide higher downstream and upstream speed options, advanced voice services, and a software-defined networking product. Larger enterprises may also receive support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services.  These services are primarily provided to  Fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises with multiple locations both within and outside of our distribution footprint, where we provide coverage outside of our service areas through agreements with other companies to use their networks.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

We also offer Ethernet network services, which  connect  multiple  locations  and  provide  higher  downstream  and  upstream  speed  options  to  medium-sized  customers  and larger enterprises, and advanced voice services, as well as video solutions for hotels and other large venues. In addition, we provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators to help manage their network bandwidth.\n\nOur business services offerings for medium-sized and enterprise customers also include a software-defined networking product, and larger enterprises may also receive support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services.

Our  advertising  business  also  represents  the  advertising  sales  efforts  of  other  multichannel  video  providers  in some markets and offers additional technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate advertisers more effectively engaging with their target audiences.\n\n## Other\n\nOur security and automation services provide home monitoring services and the ability to manage other functions within the home, such as lighting and room temperature, through our online portal, mobile apps and the X1 platform. We also license our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers.\n\n## Network and Technology\n\nOur  Cable  Communications  cable  distribution  system  uses  a  hybrid  fiber-optic  and  coaxial  cable  network  that  we  believe  is sufficiently flexible and scalable to support our future technology requirements and enables us to continue to grow capacity and capabilities  over  time.  This  network  provides  the  two-way  transmissions  that  are  essential  to  providing  broadband  services, interactive  video  services  such  as  integrated  search  functionality,  On  Demand  and  DVR,  voice  services,  and  security  and automation  services.  Leveraging  DOCSIS  3.1  technology,  Cable  Communications  currently  deploys  broadband  services  with downstream speeds for residential customers up to over a gigabit per second across nearly our entire footprint. We continue to evolve and enhance our network and plan to leverage DOCSIS 4.0 technology to begin deploying multigigabit symmetrical speeds in the future. Additionally, Cable Communications has been automating many core network functions in order to expand capacity and increase operating efficiency and to identify and fix network issues before they affect our customers.\n\nCable  Communications  continues  to  focus  on  technology  initiatives  to  design,  develop  and  deploy  next-generation  media  and content  delivery  platforms,  such  as  the  X1  and  Flex  platforms  and  cloud  DVR  technology  that  use  Internet  Protocol  ('IP') technology and our own cloud network servers to deliver video and advanced search capability. These platforms are based on our global technology platform, which integrates linear television networks, certain owned and third-party DTC streaming services and other  internet-based  apps,  and  on  demand  content  in  one  unified  experience  with  voice-activated  remote  control  search  and interactive  features.

X1 and Sky Q are cloud-based platforms that provide integrated search functionality leveraging set-top boxes and voice-activated remote controls. The integrated features operate across content in customers' video service packages and content from internet-based streaming services that customers may access in a manner similar to our Xumo Stream Box. We offer a range of video packages from basic linear service to full linear service, which typically include free-to-air networks and a range of other linear television networks including premium, sports and news networks. Our international video packages also include Sky-branded entertainment television networks that offer entertainment, premium movie and free-to-air programming, as well as Sky Sports networks that are part of our Media segment. Customers may also subscribe to digital video recorder ('DVR') services or access our video on demand services with programming that is available for no additional cost or to rent or buy digitally. These viewing options are also available through our mobile apps and online portals.\n\nWe also offer DTC streaming services marketed under the NOW brand, with an offering in the United States that launched in 2023. NOW services provide video content over the internet and do not require a set-top box. Our international NOW service offerings include packages for monthly access to entertainment, sports and movie programming, as well as daily pass options for sports programming.  Our domestic  NOW  TV  service is only offered to qualifying residential broadband customers  and  includes  monthly  access  to  a  variety  of  linear  television  networks;  entertainment  and  movie  programming;  integrated  access  to  free  streaming channels from Xumo Play, NBC and Sky; and access to the ad-supported tier of Peacock.\n\nWe also offer video services in the United Kingdom and Italy over a broadband connection without the need for a satellite dish. These services have an operating system similar to Sky Q and are offered to customers through Sky Stream, which leverages a streaming device and Wi-Fi, or to customers that purchase our Sky G lass smart televisions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nAs part of our distribution agreements with domestic cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that our advertising business sells, and we also sell advertising on our Sky-branded entertainment television networks and on our digital platforms. We also enter into representation agreements under which we sell advertising on behalf of third parties both domestically and internationally. Additionally, we offer technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate effective engagement of advertisers with their target audiences.\n\n## Other\n\nWe offer residential wireline voice services primarily using interconnected V oice over Internet Protocol ('V oIP') technology, and we offer residential security and automation  services.  We  also  license  our  technology  platforms  to  other  multichannel  video  providers  and  distribute  certain  of  our  Sky-branded  entertainment television networks to third-party video service providers.\n\n## Business Services Connectivity Segment\n\nOur Business Services Connectivity segment consists of our domestic service offerings for small businesses, which include broadband, wireline voice and wireless services, as well as our enterprise solutions offerings for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises. Certain business customers subscribe to our video services, and the associated revenue is included in our Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segment. We also have certain business connectivity service offerings in the United Kingdom.\n\nOur domestic broadband offerings have a range of service levels, including fiber-based services that deliver symmetrical speeds ranging up to 100 gigabits per second.\n\nOur small business broadband, wireline voice and wireless service offerings are similar to those provided to our residential customers and also include cloud-based cybersecurity services, wireless backup connectivity, advanced Wi-Fi solutions, video monitoring services and other cloud-based services.\n\nOur enterprise solutions offerings also include ethernet network services, which connect multiple locations and provide higher downstream and upstream speed options, advanced voice services, and a software-defined networking product. Larger enterprises may also receive support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services.  These services are primarily provided to  Fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises with multiple locations both within and outside of our distribution footprint, where we provide coverage outside of our service areas through agreements with other companies to use their networks.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

This  network  provides  the  two-way  transmissions  that  are  essential  to  providing  broadband  services, interactive  video  services  such  as  integrated  search  functionality,  On  Demand  and  DVR,  voice  services,  and  security  and automation  services.  Leveraging  DOCSIS  3.1  technology,  Cable  Communications  currently  deploys  broadband  services  with downstream speeds for residential customers up to over a gigabit per second across nearly our entire footprint. We continue to evolve and enhance our network and plan to leverage DOCSIS 4.0 technology to begin deploying multigigabit symmetrical speeds in the future. Additionally, Cable Communications has been automating many core network functions in order to expand capacity and increase operating efficiency and to identify and fix network issues before they affect our customers.\n\nCable  Communications  continues  to  focus  on  technology  initiatives  to  design,  develop  and  deploy  next-generation  media  and content  delivery  platforms,  such  as  the  X1  and  Flex  platforms  and  cloud  DVR  technology  that  use  Internet  Protocol  ('IP') technology and our own cloud network servers to deliver video and advanced search capability. These platforms are based on our global technology platform, which integrates linear television networks, certain owned and third-party DTC streaming services and other  internet-based  apps,  and  on  demand  content  in  one  unified  experience  with  voice-activated  remote  control  search  and interactive  features.  Cable  Communications  also  pursues  technology  initiatives  related  to  broadband  services  that  leverage  our global technology platform, providing customers with in-and-out-of-home Wi-Fi, the ability to manage their Wi-Fi network and connected home with our xFi whole-home application and online portal, advanced security technology and other features.\n\n## Sources of Supply and Other Operations\n\nTo offer video services, Cable Communications licenses substantial amounts of programming from cable and broadcast networks, as  well  as  from  local  broadcast  television  stations.

      "question": "How has the competitive threat posed by Lumen to CMCSA's broadband services evolved from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of fiber network expansion and service bundling strategies?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Lumen consistently remained a key competitor to CMCSA in the broadband market, with a clear escalation in competitive pressure as Lumen expanded its fiber-based infrastructure and emphasized bundled service offerings. In 2022, Lumen was noted as part of a group of wireline telecom companies building fiber infrastructure to deliver higher-speed services in CMCSA's footprint, with some bundling capabilities. By 2023, Lumen was explicitly called out as continuing to deploy fiber deeper into its network, enabling faster speeds and more competitive service packages. In 2024, the trend persisted, with Lumen still listed among top-tier wireline competitors, and the language suggested a continued focus on fiber expansion and bundled offerings as a core competitive strategy. This indicates a consistent and possibly intensifying competitive threat from Lumen over the three-year period.",

      "question": "How did Disney's strategic use of the Marvel brand across its streaming platforms evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this evolution indicate about its financial strategy in driving subscriber growth, particularly on Disney+ where Marvel became a top-level tile by 2023 and remained a key intangible asset in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Marvel was listed as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, alongside ESPN and Pixar, highlighting its brand value as a core asset on Disney's balance sheet. By 2023, Marvel had transitioned into an active strategic component of Disney+'s user interface, becoming a top-level 'tile' with branded programming, which was a key differentiator in the competitive DTC market. This shift was supported by Disney's plan to launch ESPN+ as a tile in early fiscal 2025, indicating a broader strategy to leverage its branded content for platform engagement. In 2024, Marvel remained listed as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, showing continued recognition of its brand equity. This 3-year progression reflects a financial and strategic pivot from passive asset recognition to active brand utilization in driving subscriber engagement \u2014 a shift that aligns with Disney's reported Disney+ subscriber base of 123 million as of September 28, 2024. The integration of Marvel content into the core streaming interface likely contributed to subscriber retention and growth, leveraging brand strength to justify continued asset valuation and platform differentiation.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## PART I\n\n## ITEM 1. Business\n\nThe Walt Disney Company, together with its subsidiaries, is a diversified worldwide entertainment company with operations in two segments: Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution (DMED) and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products (DPEP).\n\nThe terms 'Company', 'we', 'our' and 'us' are used in this report to refer collectively to the parent company and the subsidiaries through which businesses are conducted.\n\n## COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme park and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruption of content production activities.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 related disruptions on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the currently unknowable duration and severity of COVID-19 and its variants, and among other things, governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests and talent.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nThe Company's key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, the Company's human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefit, and perquisite programs; enhance the Company's culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; engage employees as brand ambassadors of the Company's content, products and experiences; and evolve and invest in technology, tools, and resources to enable employees at work.\n\nThe Company employed approximately 220,000 people as of October 1, 2022, of which approximately 166,000 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 54,000 were employed internationally. Our global workforce is comprised of approximately 78% full time and 15% part time employees, with another 7% being seasonal employees. A significant number of employees in various parts of our businesses, including employees of our theme parks, and writers, directors, actors and production personnel for our productions are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, some of our employees outside the U.S. are represented by works councils, trade unions or other employee associations.\n\nSome of our key programs and initiatives to attract, develop and retain our diverse workforce include:\n\n- Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&amp;I): Our DE&amp;I objectives are to build teams that reflect the life experiences of our audiences, while employing and supporting a diverse array of voices in our creative and production teams. Our DE&amp;I initiatives and programs include:\n- The Company's Reimagine Tomorrow efforts, which build on Disney's longstanding commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, and features a website, Disney's first large-scale platform for amplifying underrepresented voices\n- Executive Incubator, Creative Talent Development and Inclusion, and the Disney Launchpad: Shorts Incubator, which are designed to create a pipeline of next-generation creative executives from underrepresented backgrounds\n- Development programs, which target underrepresented talent\n- Innovative learning opportunities, which spark dialogue among employees, leaders, Disney talent and external experts\n- Over 100 employee-led Business Employee Resource Groups (BERGs), which represent and support the diverse communities that make up our workforce\n- The Disney Look appearance guidelines, which were updated to cultivate a more inclusive environment that encourages and celebrates authentic expressions of belonging among employees",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's theme parks and resorts as well as Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club compete with other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. The profitability of the leisure-time industry may be influenced by various factors that are not directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations, health concerns, the political environment, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure time, oil and transportation prices, weather patterns and natural disasters. The licensing and retail business competes with other licensors, retailers and publishers of character, brand and celebrity names, as well as other licensors, publishers and developers of game software, online video content, websites, other types of home entertainment and retailers of toys and kids merchandise.\n\nAll of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on a year-round basis. Typically, theme park attendance and resort occupancy fluctuate based on the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities, the opening of new guest offerings and pricing and promotional offers. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods. In addition, theme park and resort revenues may be higher during significant celebrations such as theme park or character anniversaries and lower in the periods following such celebrations. The licensing, retail and wholesale businesses are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the Company's first and fourth fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases and cable programming broadcasts.\n\n## STAR INDIA TRANSACTION\n\nThe Company and Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) plan to close a transaction on or about November 14, 2024, which will form a joint venture that combines our Star-branded and other general entertainment and sports television channels and direct-to-consumer Disney+ Hotstar service in India (Star India) and certain media and entertainment businesses controlled by RIL (the Star India Transaction) (see Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nThe Company's key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, the Company's human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefit and perquisite programs; enhance the Company's culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; engage employees as brand ambassadors of the Company's content, products and experiences; and evolve and invest in technology, tools and resources to enable employees at work.\n\nThe Company employed approximately 233,000 people as of September 28, 2024, of which approximately 171,000 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 62,000 were employed outside the U.S. Our global workforce comprises approximately 76% full time and 16% part time employees, with another 8% being seasonal employees. A significant number of employees in various parts of our businesses, including employees of our theme parks, and writers, directors, actors and production personnel for our productions are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, some of our employees outside the U.S. are represented by works councils, trade unions or other employee associations.\n\nSome of our key programs and initiatives to attract, develop and retain our diverse workforce include:\n\n- Health, financial, family resources, well-being and other benefits: Disney's benefit offerings are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of our diverse employees and their families. These benefit offerings for eligible employees include:\n- Healthcare options aimed at improving quality of care while limiting out-of-pocket costs\n- Retirement and savings programs that help employees adapt to changing needs and unexpected events and drive financial security in the present and the future\n- Family care resources, such as childcare and senior care programs, long-term care coverage and a family building benefit\n- Paid time-off programs, including vacation and sick and family care leave\n- Free mental health and well-being resources\n- Global well-being programs, including in-person offerings through campus health clubs and virtual and onsite events and activities focused on physical, emotional, financial and social well-being\n- Two Centers for Living Well in the Orlando area that offer convenient, on-demand access to board-certified physicians and counselors",

      "question": "How did Disney's reliance on Industrial Light & Magic for post-production services evolve from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2024, as reflected in the Content Sales/Licensing segment's structure and reported revenue streams?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Industrial Light & Magic was explicitly listed as part of the Content Sales/Licensing segment, which included revenue from post-production services alongside other activities like National Geographic publishing. By fiscal 2023, the segment continued to report post-production services through Industrial Light & Magic, but the structure began to emphasize more on TV/VOD and theatrical distribution, suggesting a shift in revenue focus. In fiscal 2024, the segment maintained the inclusion of Industrial Light & Magic\u2019s post-production services, but the narrative further aligned with broader content licensing and distribution, indicating a potential strategic repositioning of post-production within Disney's evolving DTC-first content model. This evolution suggests a stable but contextually shifting reliance on Industrial Light & Magic, with its role increasingly framed within the broader ecosystem of content delivery rather than as a standalone service.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Direct-to-Consumer\n\nDisney+, Disney+ Hotstar and Hulu are subscription services that provide video streaming of the Company's general entertainment and family programming and similar programming from third parties. Outside the U.S., Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar also include international sports programming. The services are offered individually or in various bundles, which may include ESPN+ (see Sports segment discussion), to customers directly or through third-party distributors on mobile and internet connected devices. The majority of Direct-to-Consumer revenue is derived from subscription fees and advertising.\n\n## Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar\n\nDisney+ is a subscription-based DTC service with Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic branded programming, which are all top-level selections or 'tiles' within the Disney+ interface. In the U.S., subscribers to both Disney+ and Hulu may access certain Hulu programming through a tile on Disney+. Outside the U.S., Disney+ includes a Star branded tile, which features general entertainment programming. In Latin America, Disney+ includes an ESPN branded tile, which features a variety of sports content including live events. The Company plans to launch an ESPN branded tile on Disney+ in the U.S. in early fiscal 2025.\n\nIn certain Latin American countries prior to July 2024, we offered Disney+ as well as Star+, a standalone service with a variety of general entertainment and family content and live sports programming. At the end of June 2024, we merged these services into a single Disney+ product offering.\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid Disney+ subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 123 million.\n\nDisney+ Hotstar is a subscription-based DTC service available in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Programming includes television shows, movies, sports and original series in approx imately 10 languages, in addition to gaming and social features. Disney+ Hotstar has exclusive streaming rights to certain cricket programming.\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid Disney+ Hotstar subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 36 million.\n\nDisney+ and Disney+ Hotstar offer content from the Company's various studios, including library titles, as well as content acquired from third parties.\n\nThe majority of Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar revenue is derived from subscription fees and, to a lesser extent, advertising. The Company offers an adsupported Disney+ service in the U.S., Canada and select Latin American and European markets.\n\n## Hulu\n\nHulu is a domestic subscription-based DTC service with general entertainment content from the Company's various studios as well as content licensed from third parties. Hulu's revenue is derived from subscription fees and advertising. Hulu offers subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services with or without advertising in addition to a digital OTT MVPD (Live TV) service. The Live TV service is available with either of Hulu's SVOD services and includes live linear streams of various cable and broadcast networks. In addition, Hulu offers subscriptions to premium services such as Max, Cinemax, Starz and Paramount+ with Showtime, which can be added to the Hulu service. Certain programming from ABC Network, Freeform and FX Channels is also available on the Hulu SVOD service one day after the linear airing on these channels. As of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid Hulu subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 52 million.\n\n## Content Sales/Licensing and Other\n\nThe majority of Content Sales/Licensing revenue is derived from TV/VOD, theatrical and home entertainment distribution. In addition, revenue is generated from music distribution, stage plays and post-production services through Industrial Light &amp; Magic and Skywalker Sound.\n\nThe Company also publishes National Geographic magazine, which is reported with Content Sales/Licensing.\n\n## TV/VOD Distribution\n\nWe license our content to third-party television networks, television stations and other video service providers for distribution to viewers on television or a variety of internet-connected devices, including through other DTC services.\n\n## Theatrical Distribution\n\nThe Company licenses full-length live-action and animated films to theaters globally. Cumulatively through September 28, 2024, the Company has released approximately 1,100 full-length live-action films and 100 full-length animated films. In the domestic and most major international markets, we generally distribute and market our films directly. In certain international markets our films are distributed by independent companies. In some territories, certain films may be ex clusively distributed on our DTC streaming services. During fiscal 2025, we expect to release approximately 15 films.",

      "question": "How did Disney's investment strategy and competitive positioning in its DTC offerings evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in light of rising programming costs, intensified competition, and the strategic shift toward streaming services?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Disney's investment strategy in DTC offerings evolved significantly, marked by increased financial commitment, strategic restructuring, and intensified competition. In 2022, Disney acknowledged that the costs of its DTC strategy were rising and that losses might grow or be reduced more slowly than anticipated. The company also noted that returns on some DTC-related investments were negative or low, and the business prospects were uncertain. By 2023, Disney was making strategic investments in DTC offerings with the expectation that subscription fees and advertising revenues would offset declines in affiliate fees and advertising from linear networks. The company also highlighted its strong financial position, with access to capital markets and $12.25 billion in unused bank facilities to fund ongoing operations and new projects. In 2024, the competitive landscape intensified, with rising programming costs\u2014especially for sports\u2014and increased competition from other DTC platforms. Disney also noted that programming distributors were demanding terms that reduced revenue or slowed its growth, such as offering fewer linear networks but including DTC streaming services in distribution deals. This 3-year trajectory shows a shift from cautious investment with uncertain returns to a more aggressive push into streaming amid rising costs and competitive pressures.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nretail stores; and we have announced exploration of a number of new types of businesses. In addition, with the recent change in leadership, there may be additional adjustments to our business strategies. Our new organization and strategies are, among other things, subject to execution risk and may not produce the anticipated benefits, such as supporting our growth strategies and enhancing shareholder value. For example, notwithstanding our announced plans to rationalize costs, the costs of our DTC strategy, and associated losses, may continue to grow or be reduced more slowly than anticipated, which may impact our distribution strategy across businesses/distribution platforms, the types of content we distribute through various businesses/distribution platforms, and the timing and sequencing of content windows. Our new organization and strategies could be less successful than our previous organizational structure and strategies. In addition, external events including changing technology, changing consumer purchasing patterns, acceptance of content offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. When these changes or events occur, we have incurred and may continue to incur costs to change our business strategy and have needed and may in the future need to write-down the value of assets. For example, current conditions, including COVID-19 and our business decisions, have reduced the value of some of our assets. We have impaired goodwill and intangible assets at our International Channels businesses and impaired the value of certain of our retail store assets. We may write-down other assets as our strategy evolves to account for the current business environment. We also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. In recent years, such investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme parks, expansion of our fleet of cruise ships, the acquisition of TFCF and investments related to DTC offerings. Some of these investments have returns that are negative or low, the ultimate business prospects of the businesses related to these investments are uncertain, these investments may impact the profitability of our other businesses, and these risks are exacerbated by COVID-19. In any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be negative or lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. Even if our strategies are effective in the long term, our new offerings will generally not be profitable in the short term, growth of our new offerings is unlikely to be even quarter over quarter and we may not expand into new markets as or when anticipated. Our ability to forecast for new businesses may be impacted by our lack of experience operating in those new businesses, speed with which the competitive landscape changes, volatility beyond our control (such as the events beyond our control noted above) and our ability to obtain or develop the content and rights on which our projections are based. Accordingly, we may not achieve our forecasted outcomes.\n\n## Increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs.\n\nWe face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. This includes, among other types, competition for human resources, content and other resources we require in operating our business. For example:\n\n- Our programming and production operations compete to obtain creative, performing and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support and market share with other studio operators, television networks, SVOD providers and other new sources of broadband delivered content.\n- Our television networks and stations and DTC offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with other television and SVOD services, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations. In addition, we increasingly face competition for advertising sales from internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means.\n- Our television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.\n- Our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities.\n- Our content sales/licensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.\n- Our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of IP.\n- Our DTC businesses compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors' DTC offerings, all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment, as well as for technology, creative, performing and business talent and for content.\n\nCompetition in each of these areas may further increase as a result of technological developments and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels. Increased competition may increase the cost of programming and other products and divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs.\n\nCompetition for the acquisition of resources can further increase the cost of producing our products and services, deprive us of talent necessary to produce high quality creative material or increase the cost of compensation for our employees. Such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks and DTC offerings, parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Increased competitive pressures impact our revenues, increase our costs and impact the profitability of our businesses.\n\nWe face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. This includes, among other types, competition for human resources, content and other resources we require in operating our business. For example:\n\n- Our programming and production operations compete to obtain creative, performing, production and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support, production facilities and market share with traditional and new media platforms, including other video-on-demand services and sources of broadband delivered content, studio operators and television networks.\n- Our television networks and stations and DTC offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with traditional and new media platforms, including other television and video-on-demand services and various forms of internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations.\n- Our television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.\n- Our theme parks and resorts and experiences compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities and compete for technology, creative, performing and business talent, including with other theme park and resort operators.\n- Our content sales/licensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.\n- Our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of IP.\n- Our DTC streaming services compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors' DTC offerings, all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment, as well as for technology, creative, performing and business talent and for content.\n\nTechnological developments, including developments in generative AI tools that can be used to create competing low-cost content, and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels, increase competition in these areas. Increased competition raises the cost of programming, including for sports and other products, and diverts consumers from our products and services or to other products and services or other forms of entertainment and experiences. In addition, given the nature of travel planning, consumers typically delay their consumption of certain of our products and services, such as our theme parks and resorts, in connection with planned major product launches of regional travel industry competitors. Each of these competitive pressures could reduce our revenue and increase our marketing costs.\n\nCompetition for the acquisition of resources can further increase the cost of producing our products and services; change the composition of our offerings, including sports; deprive us of talent needed for our entertainment and experiences businesses, including the talent necessary to produce high quality creative material; increase employee turnover and staffing instability; or increase our labor costs. Competition also reduces, or limits growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our linear networks and DTC offerings, parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues.\n\n## We face risks related to the renewal of long-term programming or distribution contracts on sufficiently favorable terms.\n\nWe enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. As these contracts expire, we renew or renegotiate the contracts, which from time to time has led to service blackouts when distribution contracts expired before renewal terms were agreed. We may lose programming rights or distribution rights if we are unable to renew these contracts on acceptable terms. As a result, our portfolio of acquired programming rights, such as sporting events, and the distributors of our programming and the portfolio of programming rights our distributors acquire have changed and will continue to change over time. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining certain programming rights has increased and may continue to increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical ex perience) and programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution channels, demand terms (including with respect to the pricing for, and the nature and amount of, programming distributed) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical ex perience. For ex ample, the terms of recent renewals of carriage agreements have included fewer of our linear networks or the opportunity to offer multiple genre-specific bundle options of fewer than all our linear networks while providing for certain of our DTC streaming services to be made available to the distributor's subscribers. Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms is affected by a number of factors, such as consolidation in the market for program distribution and the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and programming rights costs increases, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences.

      "answer": "From fiscal 2022 to 2024, Disney maintained a consistent policy of limiting investment credit exposure to institutions rated below A- and requiring collateral for counterparties falling below that threshold. In 2022, Disney had no balances exceeding 10% with any single institution (excluding money market funds). By 2023, this changed slightly, with balances at one or more institutions exceeding 10% of total cash and equivalents, reaching 24%. This same 24% concentration persisted into 2024. While the credit rating policy remained stable, the emergence of a 24% concentration in 2023 and its continuation in 2024 signals a material shift in Disney\u2019s cash positioning strategy relative to its earlier, more diversified approach.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, NFLX's strategy around membership plans evolved significantly. In 2022, the company emphasized the risk of multi-household account sharing and its potential negative impact on membership growth. By 2023, NFLX introduced a new, lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan and began increasing enforcement of its terms of use to limit shared viewing outside of households. In 2024, the company continued to refine its pricing and plan structure, maintaining the ad-supported model and reinforcing its enforcement of usage policies to curb password sharing.

In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\n## If our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our penetration and growth rates vary between the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\n\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. We have recently expanded our entertainment video offering to include games. If our efforts to develop and offer games are not valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, which may not be wellreceived by consumers, and which may result in existing members canceling our service or fewer new members joining our service. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. While we currently permit multiple users within the same household to share a single account for non-commercial purposes, if multi-household usage is abused or if our efforts to restrict multi-household usage are ineffective, our ability to add new members may be hindered and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\n## If our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe must continually add new members both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices that keep our members engaged with our service, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, films and games. Our penetration and growth rates have fluctuated and vary across the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by professional content creators, and more broadly other sources of entertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\n\nMembers cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, that they need to cut household expenses, dissatisfaction with content, a preference for competitive services and customer service issues that they believe are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, may also adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fix ed in nature, we may not be able to adjust our ex penditures or increase our (per membership) revenues, including by adjusting membership pricing, commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing members and attracting new members, our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## If we do not continuously provide value to our members, including making improvements to our service in a manner that is favorably received by them, our revenue, results of operations and business will be adversely affected.\n\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members, and accordingly, our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected. We expanded our entertainment video offering to include games and, more recently, live programming. If our efforts to sustain and improve our existing TV and film offering, as well as develop and expand our video entertainment options, are not done in a manner valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may also seek to extend our business into new products and services to help drive growth. For example, we continue to expand our offering of consumer products and live experiences. To the extent we cannot successfully find and develop new products, experiences and services to help drive growth, or we do not realize the expected benefits or generate additional revenue from such new products, experiences, and services, our future results of operations and growth may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe have and may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, including for example, the lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan. Similarly, we have increased enforcement of and will continue to enforce our terms of use to limit multi-household usage and shared viewing outside of a household. These and other adjustments we make may not be well-received by consumers, and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain members, revenue and our results of operations. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our ex isting members or adjustments to our service are not successful, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. We face competition from traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers and platforms. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant",

      "question": "How did Netflix's characterization and categorization of payments to ISPs evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this progression suggest about the maturation and strategic importance of their partnership with ISPs over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix categorized payments to ISPs as part of broader marketing partner payments alongside CE manufacturers and MVPDs, with marketing expenses also influenced by streaming delivery costs. By 2023, the company emphasized payments to ISPs in the context of 'marketing and advertising sales partners,' highlighting a more commercial and sales-oriented framing, though no specific dollar amounts were disclosed. In 2024, the categorization returned to a broader 'marketing and advertising sales partners' structure, but with a sharper focus on advertising and promotional activities, suggesting a more mature and integrated partnership. The evolution from operational alignment (2022) to strategic sales enablement (2023) and finally to a consolidated marketing ecosystem (2024) indicates that ISPs became a more embedded and strategic component of Netflix\u2019s go-to-market strategy over the three-year period.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix's financial risk exposure related to original programming increased as its investment in content production scaled. In 2022, the company highlighted its growing commitment to original programming as a key differentiator, noting upfront cash payments for content production often exceeded amortization expenses, creating short-term cash flow pressures. By 2023, Netflix explicitly stated it was devoting 'significant resources' toward original programming and acknowledged new risks from production costs, guild payments, and third-party liabilities, particularly as it acquired studios like Scanline and Animal Logic. In 2024, the company expanded its risk disclosures to include broader concerns around international content operations, live programming, and consumer product licensing, indicating a more complex and globally distributed risk profile. The trend shows a clear evolution from content investment as a growth lever in 2022 to content production as a central financial and operational risk by 2024.",

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nNetflix, Inc. (the 'Company') was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approximately 222 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can engage as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, the Company continues to offer its DVD-by-mail service in the United States (\"U.S.\").\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Recently adopted accounting pronouncements\n\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740) . ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions for performing intraperiod tax allocations, recognizing deferred taxes for investments, and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The guidance also simplifies the accounting for franchise taxes, transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill, and the effect of enacted changes in tax laws or rates in interim periods. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 in the first quarter of 2021 and the adoption had no material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. While the Company is continuing to assess the timing of adoption and the potential impacts of ASU 2021-08, it does not expect ASU 2021-08 to have a material effect, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.\n\n## Content\n\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.",

They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. In addition, new technological developments, including the development and use of generative artificial intelligence, are rapidly evolving. If our competitors gain an advantage by using such technologies more effectively to satisfy consumer demand, our ability to compete successfully and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Piracy also threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. In light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth, and our efforts to prevent that growth may be insufficient. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors and win moments of truth, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\n## We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We devote significant resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming. We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As a content producer, we are responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments, and take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Further, negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements have, and in the future, could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming. We may face potential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, is prohibited by law, or could be damaging to our brand or business.\n\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\n## If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our services, such as introducing games and advertising on our service, as well as offering live programming and expanding our consumer products and experiences. We are also scaling our own studio operations to produce original content. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service and introduce new features such as our ad-supported subscription plan and live programming, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party 'cloud' computing, technology and other services. As we scale our content production, including games, and introduce new features and expand our consumer products and experience offerings, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources, which requires significant resources and management attention. Further, we may expand our content and service offerings in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or evolving our corporate culture, as well as our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.\n\n## If we fail to maintain a positiv e reputation concerning our serv ice and the content w e offer, w e may not be able to attract or retain members, w e may face regulatory scrutiny and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect",

In 2023, the plan was amended and restated (Exhibit 10.5\u2020), with a filing date of December 9, 2022, showing active revision and formalization. By 2024, the Amended and Restated Performance Bonus Plan (Exhibit 10.5\u2020) was carried forward without further changes, remaining consistent with the 2023 version and continuing to serve as a foundational document integrated with newer compensation structures like performance-based restricted stock unit agreements.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix's dependency on third-party rights holders for content licensing remained a critical business risk, but the nature and emphasis of the risk evolved. In 2022, the company highlighted the increasing cost of programming and the potential for content providers to withdraw content quickly, which could impact member retention. By 2023, the focus shifted slightly, with Netflix emphasizing its reliance on intellectual property rights enforcement and the growing regulatory landscape that could affect content availability and cost. In 2024, the company reiterated its dependence on rights holders but also underscored its strategic focus on global content production and human capital investments to mitigate risks. The trend indicates a consistent challenge with rising licensing costs and content volatility, with Netflix adapting through internal content development and enhanced legal and operational frameworks.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n## If studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g. remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights could expose us to greater distribution expenses.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights ex tend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and the consumer products and experiences based thereon. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\n## REGULATION\n\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix . This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the ex tent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 14,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,600 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,200 (16%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 600 (4%) in Latin America and 1,600 (11%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year and may be covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe an important component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our employees to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of ex cellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. As our business grows and changes, we seek to improve our culture to meet the new needs of our business. We believe our dynamic culture helps us create a better ex perience for our members, employees, creators and partners.\n\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix  employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it's important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by educating our people leaders and recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\n\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer various experiences and training to inform our employees about our culture and other context that we believe is important for success at Netflix . We aim to equip our people leaders (officers, V Ps, directors, and manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic objectives.\n\nWe aim generally to pay our employees at their personal top of market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender identity (globally) and race or ethnicity (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\n\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\n\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA offered shared data plans exclusively as part of bundled service offerings to residential customers in the U.S. who subscribed to broadband services. By 2023, the company maintained this structure but emphasized the flexibility of customers being able to choose between unlimited data plans, shared data plans, or per-gigabyte plans. In 2024, CMCSA expanded its wireless offerings internationally and introduced prepaid unlimited data plans under the NOW brand, while continuing to offer shared data plans and further diversifying plan options for domestic and international customers. This evolution shows increasing flexibility and geographic diversification of shared data plan offerings.",

      "question": "How did the competitive threat from wireless telecommunications companies to CMCSA's broadband and wireless services evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of technological capabilities (e.g., 4G, 5G, fixed wireless), bundling strategies, and specific competitors named across the filings?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the competitive threat from wireless telecommunications companies to CMCSA intensified due to advancements in wireless technology and bundling strategies. In 2022, CMCSA noted that wireless companies were offering internet services using 4G and 5G wireless broadband, which posed a growing threat to its broadband services. By 2023, the filings specifically named major wireless competitors such as AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon in the U.S., and highlighted that these companies were increasingly deploying 5G fixed wireless networks as a competitive tool. In 2024, the filings emphasized that wireless companies were not only enhancing their network capabilities but also bundling DTC streaming services with wireless plans, creating a more integrated and attractive offering for consumers. This evolution shows a clear trend of increasing pressure from wireless providers leveraging both technological improvements and strategic bundling to capture market share.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nBelow is a summary of the most significant sources of competition; for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the 'Competition' discussion within that section.\n\n- Cable Communications' and Sky's broadband services compete primarily against wireline telecommunications companies, including many that are increasing deployment of fiber-based networks, wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services (such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services), certain electric cooperatives and municipalities in the United  States  that  own  and  operate  their  own  broadband  networks  and  DBS  and  newer  satellite  broadband  providers. Broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level, including as part of COVID-19 relief efforts as well as federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021, may result in other service providers deploying new subsidized internet access networks within our footprint. Competition for Cable Communications' video services consists primarily of DTC streaming and other  OTT  service  providers,  DBS  providers  and  telecommunications  companies  with  fiber-based networks.  Sky  faces  competition  for  its  video  services  from  cable  and  telecommunications  providers  in  its  European markets.  Our  voice  and  wireless  services  primarily  compete  with  wireless  and  wireline  telecommunications  providers. Many  of  our  competitors  offer  customers  bundled  products  and  services  with  favorable  pricing,  which  has  increased competition.\n- NBCUniversal  and  Sky  face  substantial  and  increasing  competition  from  providers  of  similar  types  of  entertainment, sports,  news  and  information  content,  as  well  as  from  other  forms  of  entertainment  and  recreational  activities. NBCUniversal  and  Sky  must  compete  to  obtain  talent,  popular  content  (including  sports  programming)  and  other resources required to successfully operate their businesses. This competition has intensified as DTC streaming and other OTT service providers seek to develop high-quality programming and acquire live sports programming to attract viewers.\n\nConsolidation  of,  or  cooperation  between,  our  competitors,  including  suppliers  and  distributors  of  content,  may  increase competition in all of these areas, as may the emergence of additional competitors with significant resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing and packaging, who are competing with our businesses in all forms of content distribution and production. For example, such consolidation or cooperation may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost  streaming  services,  potentially  on  an  exclusive  basis,  through  unlimited  data-usage  plans  for  internet  or  wireless  phone services.\n\nThe  ability  of  our  businesses  to  compete  effectively  also  depends  on  our  perceived  image  and  reputation  among  our  various constituencies,  including  our  customers,  consumers,  advertisers,  business  partners,  employees,  investors  and  government authorities. In addition, our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience.\n\n## Changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.\n\nDistribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming and other OTT services, the number of Cable Communications' video customers and amount of subscriber fees paid to NBCUniversal's television networks decrease, even as Cable Communications' broadband services have become more important to consumers. DTC streaming and other OTT services have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much they pay for such content.\n\nFor  example,  Cable  Communications  continues  to  experience  net  video  customer  losses.  In  Europe,  more  of  Sky's  new  video customers  have  recently  subscribed,  and  may  continue  to  subscribe,  to  NOW,  Sky's  DTC  streaming  service,  instead  of  its traditional  DTH  video  service.  Although  we  have  attempted  to  adapt  our  video  service  offerings  and  enhance  our  broadband services for changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying the X1 and Sky Q platforms, Flex, developing new smart televisions using our global technology platform at Sky and Cable Communications, and by offering Peacock, the continuing trend of content owners delivering their content directly to consumers rather than through, or in addition to, traditional video distribution channels continues to disrupt traditional distribution business models.\n\nThe  increase  in  DTC  streaming  and  other  OTT  service  providers  also  has  significantly  increased  the  number  of  entertainment choices available to consumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers. The use of DTC streaming and other OTT services reduce traditional television viewership,  and  coupled  with  time-shifting  technologies,  such  as  DVR  and  on  demand  services,  have  caused  and  likely  will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our television programming channels. In addition, as more programming providers offer  their  content  directly  to  consumers  through  their  own  apps  or  platforms,  they  may  reduce  the  quantity  and  quality  of  the programming they license to NBCUniversal or Sky's television channels or to Peacock.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

We compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, sports, news and information content to consumers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.\n\nBelow is a summary of our most significant sources of competition. Many of these competitors offer competitive pricing, packaging and/or bundling of services to customers, which further increases competition. For a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the 'Competition' discussion within that section.\n\n- Connectivity  &amp;  Platforms'  broadband  services  compete  primarily  against  wireline  telecommunications  companies,  including  many  that  are  increasing deployment of fiber-based networks; wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services (using a variety of technologies, including 5G  fixed wireless networks and 4G  and 5G  wireless broadband services); electric cooperatives and municipalities in the United States that own and operate their own broadband networks; and DBS and newer satellite broadband providers. Broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level may result in other service providers deploying new subsidized internet access networks within our footprint, and in cases where we receive subsidies, may impose constraints on how we conduct our businesses. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see '-We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses' below and Item 1: Business and refer to the 'Legislation and Regulation' discussion within that section.\n- Our wireless and voice services compete with both telecommunications and wireless telecommunication providers.\n- Competition for video services consists primarily of DTC streaming service providers and aggregators, DBS providers and telecommunications companies.\n- Business Services Connectivity primarily competes with wireline telecommunications companies and wide area network managed service providers.\n- Our businesses in Content &amp; Experiences, as well as our video business, face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of entertainment, sports, news and information content, as well as from other forms of entertainment, including from social networking and user-generated content,  as  well  as  tourism,  recreational  activities  and  lodging.  They  must  compete  to  obtain  talent,  popular  content  (including  sports  programming), advertising and other resources required to successfully operate their businesses. This competition has further intensified as certain DTC streaming service providers have commissioned, and may continue to commission, high-cost programming and acquire live sports programming rights to attract viewers at significant costs.\n\nCompetitors with significant resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing and packaging continue to increasingly compete with our businesses in all forms. Some of these competitors could also have preferential access to customer data or other competitive information. Further, consolidation of, or cooperation between, our competitors may increase competition in all of these areas. For example, cooperation between competitors may allow them to offer a range of products and services, including aggregating certain content into a stand-alone offering, offering free or lower cost DTC streaming services, potentially on an exclusive basis, through unlimited data-usage plans for broadband and wireless services or bundling DTC streaming services on their platforms.\n\nOur competitive position may be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience. In addition, our ability to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, business partners, employees, investors and government authorities. For example, some of these constituencies may have their own, and some have conflicting, environmental, social and governance priorities, which may present risks to our reputation and brands if these constituencies perceive misalignment.\n\n## Changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.\n\nDistribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content continue to challenge existing business models, increase the number of competitors that our businesses face, and have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much or for how long they pay for such content.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n18",

Our  advertising  business  also  represents  the  advertising  sales  efforts  of  other  multichannel  video  providers  in some markets and offers additional technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate advertisers more effectively engaging with their target audiences.\n\n## Other\n\nOur security and automation services provide home monitoring services and the ability to manage other functions within the home, such as lighting and room temperature, through our online portal, mobile apps and the X1 platform. We also license our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers.\n\n## Network and Technology\n\nOur  Cable  Communications  cable  distribution  system  uses  a  hybrid  fiber-optic  and  coaxial  cable  network  that  we  believe  is sufficiently flexible and scalable to support our future technology requirements and enables us to continue to grow capacity and capabilities  over  time.  This  network  provides  the  two-way  transmissions  that  are  essential  to  providing  broadband  services, interactive  video  services  such  as  integrated  search  functionality,  On  Demand  and  DVR,  voice  services,  and  security  and automation  services.  Leveraging  DOCSIS  3.1  technology,  Cable  Communications  currently  deploys  broadband  services  with downstream speeds for residential customers up to over a gigabit per second across nearly our entire footprint. We continue to evolve and enhance our network and plan to leverage DOCSIS 4.0 technology to begin deploying multigigabit symmetrical speeds in the future. Additionally, Cable Communications has been automating many core network functions in order to expand capacity and increase operating efficiency and to identify and fix network issues before they affect our customers.\n\nCable  Communications  continues  to  focus  on  technology  initiatives  to  design,  develop  and  deploy  next-generation  media  and content  delivery  platforms,  such  as  the  X1  and  Flex  platforms  and  cloud  DVR  technology  that  use  Internet  Protocol  ('IP') technology and our own cloud network servers to deliver video and advanced search capability. These platforms are based on our global technology platform, which integrates linear television networks, certain owned and third-party DTC streaming services and other  internet-based  apps,  and  on  demand  content  in  one  unified  experience  with  voice-activated  remote  control  search  and interactive  features.  Cable  Communications  also  pursues  technology  initiatives  related  to  broadband  services  that  leverage  our global technology platform, providing customers with in-and-out-of-home Wi-Fi, the ability to manage their Wi-Fi network and connected home with our xFi whole-home application and online portal, advanced security technology and other features.\n\n## Sources of Supply and Other Operations\n\nTo offer video services, Cable Communications licenses substantial amounts of programming from cable and broadcast networks, as  well  as  from  local  broadcast  television  stations.  The  fees  associated  with  these  programming  distribution  agreements  are generally based on the number of subscribers who are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which the content is provided. We seek to include in distribution agreements the rights to offer such programming through multiple delivery platforms, such as through our On Demand service, online portal, mobile apps and Flex.\n\nFor  wireless  services,  we  have  an  MVNO  agreement  that  allows  us  to  offer  services  using  Verizon's  wireless  network  and  we purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of wireless handsets, tablets and smart watches that we sell to wireless customers.\n\nCable  Communications  purchases  from  a  limited  number  of  suppliers  a  significant  amount  of  customer  premise  equipment, including  wireless  gateways  and  set-top  boxes,  network  equipment  and  services  to  provide  services  to  residential  and  business customers.\n\nCable Communications uses two primary vendors to provide customer billing for our residential and business customers.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How did CMCSA's data-driven services evolve from 2022 to 2024 in terms of scope, international reach, and enterprise integration, and what does this progression suggest about the company's strategic positioning in the advertising technology market?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's data-driven services were primarily focused on supporting advertising sales efforts for local, regional, and national advertisers within the U.S., emphasizing tools and technology to help advertisers engage more effectively with target audiences. By 2023, the company expanded these services internationally, offering technology, tools, and data-driven services not only domestically but also on behalf of third parties in global markets, signaling a broader strategic reach. In 2024, the data-driven services matured into a more enterprise-centric offering, with an emphasis on integrating advanced technology solutions into advertising platforms, particularly for larger enterprises and Fortune 1000 companies. This evolution\u2014from localized advertising support to international third-party representation to enterprise-focused tech integration\u2014suggests a deliberate strategy to position CMCSA as a competitive player in the global advertising technology space, with a focus on high-margin, scalable services for large clients.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, CMCSA consistently identified Lumen as a key competitor in the broadband space, with Lumen actively expanding its fiber-based network infrastructure. In 2022, Lumen was noted as one of the wireline telecommunications companies building fiber infrastructure to offer higher-speed data transmission services in CMCSA's service areas. By 2023, this trend continued, with Lumen further extending its fiber-based services, increasing competitive pressure through enhanced speeds and bundled offerings. In 2024, Lumen remained a prominent competitor, with its fiber infrastructure expansion continuing to overlap with CMCSA\u2019s footprint, intensifying competition in broadband services. The consistent mention of Lumen across all three years underscores its growing influence as a fiber-based competitor, directly impacting CMCSA's market positioning and service strategies.",

Our customer service teams also provide 24/7 call-answering capability, telemarketing and other services. Our technical services group performs various tasks, including installations, plant maintenance and upgrades to our cable distribution system. Customers can use self-service help and support and perform self-installations for certain services.\n\n## Competition\n\nCompetition for Cable Communications' services consists primarily of telecommunications companies with fiber-based networks, DTC streaming and other over-the-top ('OTT') service providers and direct broadcast satellite ('DBS') providers that typically offer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours.\n\n## Residential\n\n## Broadband\n\nCable Communications competes with a number of companies offering internet services, including:\n\n- wireline telecommunications companies\n- wireless telecommunications companies\n- municipal broadband networks and power companies\n- satellite broadband providers\n\nCertain wireline telecommunications companies such as AT&amp;T, Frontier, Lumen and Verizon have built and are continuing to build fiber-based network infrastructure farther into their networks, which allows them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those  that  can  be  provided  with  traditional  DSL  technology,  and  are  offering  services  with  these  higher  speeds  in  many  of  our service areas. Certain companies that offer DSL service have increased data transmission speeds, lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our broadband services.\n\nCertain companies have launched fiber-to-the-home networks that provide broadband services in certain areas in which we operate, and certain municipalities in our service areas are also building fiber-based networks.\n\nVarious wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of technologies, including 4G and 5G, wireless broadband and  Wi-Fi  networks.  These  networks  work  with  devices  such  as  smartphones,  laptops,  tablets,  and  mobile  and  fixed  wireless routers, as well as wireless data cards. Moreover, broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level, including as part of COVID-19 relief efforts as well as federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021, may result in other service providers deploying  new  subsidized  internet  access  networks  within  our  footprint.  The  availability  of  these  and  other  offerings  could negatively impact the demand for our broadband services.\n\n## Video\n\nCable Communications competes with a number of different sources in the United States that provide news, sports, information and entertainment programming to consumers, including:\n\n- DTC streaming and other OTT service providers including:\n- subscription-based services, such as Disney+ and Netflix, that offer online services that enable internet streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming\n- virtual  multichannel  video  providers,  such  as  Hulu  +  Live  TV  and  YouTube  TV,  that  offer  streamed  linear programming networks\n- DBS providers, including DIRECTV and DISH Network, that transmit satellite signals to substantially all U.S. households to provide video programming and other information similar to our video services\n- companies, including AT&amp;T and Verizon, that have built and continue to build fiber-based networks that provide video services similar to ours, overlap a substantial portion of our service areas, and in some cases provide bundled offerings that include wireless phone services\n- other providers that build and operate communications systems and services in the same areas that we serve, including those operating as franchised cable operators\n- other  companies,  such  as  local  broadcast  television  stations,  that  provide  multiple  channels  of  free  over-the-air programming",

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix introduced games as a new component of its service offering and warned that if these efforts were not valued by members, it could negatively impact member acquisition and retention. In 2023, the company expanded its membership plans by introducing a lower-priced ad-supported subscription tier and noted that such adjustments might not be well-received by consumers, potentially leading to higher churn or reduced sign-ups. By 2024, Netflix had further diversified its offerings with the inclusion of live programming and continued to emphasize the risk that changes to pricing, plans, or service features could adversely affect member satisfaction and retention. Across all three years, Netflix consistently highlighted the risk that if consumers did not perceive the evolving service offering as valuable \u2014 whether due to new features, pricing changes, or content mix \u2014 the company could face challenges in both retaining existing members and acquiring new ones.",

Our penetration and growth rates vary between the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\n\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. We have recently expanded our entertainment video offering to include games. If our efforts to develop and offer games are not valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, which may not be wellreceived by consumers, and which may result in existing members canceling our service or fewer new members joining our service. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. While we currently permit multiple users within the same household to share a single account for non-commercial purposes, if multi-household usage is abused or if our efforts to restrict multi-household usage are ineffective, our ability to add new members may be hindered and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete",

We expanded our entertainment video offering to include games and, more recently, live programming. If our efforts to sustain and improve our existing TV and film offering, as well as develop and expand our video entertainment options, are not done in a manner valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may also seek to extend our business into new products and services to help drive growth. For example, we continue to expand our offering of consumer products and live experiences. To the extent we cannot successfully find and develop new products, experiences and services to help drive growth, or we do not realize the expected benefits or generate additional revenue from such new products, experiences, and services, our future results of operations and growth may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe have and may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, including for example, the lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan. Similarly, we have increased enforcement of and will continue to enforce our terms of use to limit multi-household usage and shared viewing outside of a household. These and other adjustments we make may not be well-received by consumers, and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain members, revenue and our results of operations.

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported a $633 million increase in other cost of revenues, driven in part by rising streaming delivery costs associated with its growing member base. By 2023, the company's marketing expenses included continued payments to ISPs and other partners, reflecting an ongoing strategic reliance on these entities to support its expanding global infrastructure. In 2024, the $1,104 million increase in content amortization, coupled with sustained mention of payments to ISPs in marketing expenses, indicates that Netflix's dependency on ISPs not only persisted but likely intensified as streaming demand grew. This progression shows a clear trend of increasing reliance on ISPs across the three-year period, both in terms of delivery infrastructure and marketing partnerships.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix emphasized its ongoing commitment to original programming as a key differentiator and brand enhancer, noting that it devotes significant resources to the development, production, marketing, and distribution of original content. By 2023, the company had begun scaling its own studio operations to produce original content, including strategic acquisitions like Scanline and Animal Logic, signaling a shift toward greater vertical integration and control over content creation. In 2024, Netflix acknowledged growing risks tied to original programming, including production cost overruns, guild payment obligations, and potential liability for content-related claims, while also highlighting the importance of original and exclusive programming in attracting and retaining members. The trend shows a deliberate and expanding investment in original content, accompanied by an increasing awareness and management of the associated financial and operational risks.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## NETFLIX, INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nNetflix, Inc. (the 'Company') was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approximately 222 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can engage as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, the Company continues to offer its DVD-by-mail service in the United States (\"U.S.\").\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Recently adopted accounting pronouncements\n\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740) . ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions for performing intraperiod tax allocations, recognizing deferred taxes for investments, and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The guidance also simplifies the accounting for franchise taxes, transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill, and the effect of enacted changes in tax laws or rates in interim periods. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 in the first quarter of 2021 and the adoption had no material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. While the Company is continuing to assess the timing of adoption and the potential impacts of ASU 2021-08, it does not expect ASU 2021-08 to have a material effect, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.\n\n## Content\n\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.",

They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. In addition, new technological developments, including the development and use of generative artificial intelligence, are rapidly evolving. If our competitors gain an advantage by using such technologies more effectively to satisfy consumer demand, our ability to compete successfully and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Piracy also threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. In light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth, and our efforts to prevent that growth may be insufficient. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors and win moments of truth, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\n## We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We devote significant resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming. We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As a content producer, we are responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments, and take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Further, negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements have, and in the future, could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming. We may face potential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, is prohibited by law, or could be damaging to our brand or business.\n\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\n## If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our services, such as introducing games and advertising on our service, as well as offering live programming and expanding our consumer products and experiences. We are also scaling our own studio operations to produce original content. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service and introduce new features such as our ad-supported subscription plan and live programming, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party 'cloud' computing, technology and other services. As we scale our content production, including games, and introduce new features and expand our consumer products and experience offerings, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources, which requires significant resources and management attention. Further, we may expand our content and service offerings in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or evolving our corporate culture, as well as our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.\n\n## If we fail to maintain a positiv e reputation concerning our serv ice and the content w e offer, w e may not be able to attract or retain members, w e may face regulatory scrutiny and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect",

      "question": "How has Netflix's reliance on rights holders for content licensing evolved from 2022 through 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's content acquisition strategy amid rising competition and regulatory changes?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix's reliance on rights holders for content licensing has remained a core risk factor but has been increasingly framed in the context of rising competition and regulatory pressures. In 2022, the company emphasized the risk of content unavailability due to rights holders withdrawing content or increasing licensing costs, especially as studios launched their own streaming services. By 2023, the discussion remained consistent, with a focus on the variability of license terms and the importance of maintaining a compelling mix of content to support membership growth. In 2024, the narrative evolved to include regulatory impacts\u2014such as content quotas and investment obligations in various countries\u2014as additional constraints on content availability and ownership rights. This progression indicates a strategic shift toward securing exclusive and original content while navigating a more regulated and competitive global environment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n## If studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g. remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights could expose us to greater distribution expenses.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the",

We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights ex tend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and the consumer products and experiences based thereon. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\n## REGULATION\n\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix . This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the ex tent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 14,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,600 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,200 (16%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 600 (4%) in Latin America and 1,600 (11%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year and may be covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe an important component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our employees to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of ex cellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. As our business grows and changes, we seek to improve our culture to meet the new needs of our business. We believe our dynamic culture helps us create a better ex perience for our members, employees, creators and partners.\n\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix  employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it's important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by educating our people leaders and recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\n\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer various experiences and training to inform our employees about our culture and other context that we believe is important for success at Netflix . We aim to equip our people leaders (officers, V Ps, directors, and manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic objectives.\n\nWe aim generally to pay our employees at their personal top of market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender identity (globally) and race or ethnicity (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\n\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\n\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.",

      "question": "How did Disney's strategic use of the Marvel brand evolve across its Direct-to-Consumer services and intangible asset disclosures from 2022 to 2024, and what does this reveal about the brand's growing importance in Disney's streaming platform?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Marvel was identified as a key indefinite-lived intangible asset alongside ESPN and Pixar, indicating its long-term brand value. By 2023, Marvel had become a core branded tile within Disney+, a central component of Disney's Direct-to-Consumer strategy, highlighting its role in driving subscriber engagement. In 2024, Marvel remained a named indefinite-lived intangible asset, reinforcing its enduring value while Disney+ reported 123 million paid subscribers, suggesting that Marvel content significantly contributed to the platform's growth and brand differentiation. This 3-year trajectory shows Marvel's increasing strategic integration into Disney's streaming services while maintaining its status as a core intangible asset.",

Business\n\nThe Walt Disney Company, together with its subsidiaries, is a diversified worldwide entertainment company with operations in two segments: Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution (DMED) and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products (DPEP).\n\nThe terms 'Company', 'we', 'our' and 'us' are used in this report to refer collectively to the parent company and the subsidiaries through which businesses are conducted.\n\n## COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme park and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruption of content production activities.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 related disruptions on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the currently unknowable duration and severity of COVID-19 and its variants, and among other things, governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests and talent.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nThe Company's key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, the Company's human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefit, and perquisite programs; enhance the Company's culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; engage employees as brand ambassadors of the Company's content, products and experiences; and evolve and invest in technology, tools, and resources to enable employees at work.\n\nThe Company employed approximately 220,000 people as of October 1, 2022, of which approximately 166,000 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 54,000 were employed internationally. Our global workforce is comprised of approximately 78% full time and 15% part time employees, with another 7% being seasonal employees. A significant number of employees in various parts of our businesses, including employees of our theme parks, and writers, directors, actors and production personnel for our productions are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, some of our employees outside the U.S. are represented by works councils, trade unions or other employee associations.\n\nSome of our key programs and initiatives to attract, develop and retain our diverse workforce include:\n\n- Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&amp;I): Our DE&amp;I objectives are to build teams that reflect the life experiences of our audiences, while employing and supporting a diverse array of voices in our creative and production teams. Our DE&amp;I initiatives and programs include:\n- The Company's Reimagine Tomorrow efforts, which build on Disney's longstanding commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, and features a website, Disney's first large-scale platform for amplifying underrepresented voices\n- Executive Incubator, Creative Talent Development and Inclusion, and the Disney Launchpad: Shorts Incubator, which are designed to create a pipeline of next-generation creative executives from underrepresented backgrounds\n- Development programs, which target underrepresented talent\n- Innovative learning opportunities, which spark dialogue among employees, leaders, Disney talent and external experts\n- Over 100 employee-led Business Employee Resource Groups (BERGs), which represent and support the diverse communities that make up our workforce\n- The Disney Look appearance guidelines, which were updated to cultivate a more inclusive environment that encourages and celebrates authentic expressions of belonging among employees",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's theme parks and resorts as well as Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club compete with other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. The profitability of the leisure-time industry may be influenced by various factors that are not directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations, health concerns, the political environment, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure time, oil and transportation prices, weather patterns and natural disasters. The licensing and retail business competes with other licensors, retailers and publishers of character, brand and celebrity names, as well as other licensors, publishers and developers of game software, online video content, websites, other types of home entertainment and retailers of toys and kids merchandise.\n\nAll of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on a year-round basis. Typically, theme park attendance and resort occupancy fluctuate based on the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities, the opening of new guest offerings and pricing and promotional offers. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods. In addition, theme park and resort revenues may be higher during significant celebrations such as theme park or character anniversaries and lower in the periods following such celebrations. The licensing, retail and wholesale businesses are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the Company's first and fourth fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases and cable programming broadcasts.\n\n## STAR INDIA TRANSACTION\n\nThe Company and Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) plan to close a transaction on or about November 14, 2024, which will form a joint venture that combines our Star-branded and other general entertainment and sports television channels and direct-to-consumer Disney+ Hotstar service in India (Star India) and certain media and entertainment businesses controlled by RIL (the Star India Transaction) (see Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nThe Company's key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, the Company's human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefit and perquisite programs; enhance the Company's culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; engage employees as brand ambassadors of the Company's content, products and experiences; and evolve and invest in technology, tools and resources to enable employees at work.\n\nThe Company employed approximately 233,000 people as of September 28, 2024, of which approximately 171,000 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 62,000 were employed outside the U.S. Our global workforce comprises approximately 76% full time and 16% part time employees, with another 8% being seasonal employees. A significant number of employees in various parts of our businesses, including employees of our theme parks, and writers, directors, actors and production personnel for our productions are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, some of our employees outside the U.S. are represented by works councils, trade unions or other employee associations.\n\nSome of our key programs and initiatives to attract, develop and retain our diverse workforce include:\n\n- Health, financial, family resources, well-being and other benefits: Disney's benefit offerings are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of our diverse employees and their families. These benefit offerings for eligible employees include:\n- Healthcare options aimed at improving quality of care while limiting out-of-pocket costs\n- Retirement and savings programs that help employees adapt to changing needs and unexpected events and drive financial security in the present and the future\n- Family care resources, such as childcare and senior care programs, long-term care coverage and a family building benefit\n- Paid time-off programs, including vacation and sick and family care leave\n- Free mental health and well-being resources\n- Global well-being programs, including in-person offerings through campus health clubs and virtual and onsite events and activities focused on physical, emotional, financial and social well-being\n- Two Centers for Living Well in the Orlando area that offer convenient, on-demand access to board-certified physicians and counselors",

      "question": "How did Disney's strategic approach to DTC offerings evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of investment focus, competitive positioning, and expectations for revenue growth?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Disney acknowledged the financial risks of its DTC strategy, noting that the costs and associated losses 'may continue to grow or be reduced more slowly than anticipated' and that returns on new investments, including DTC offerings, 'may be negative or lower than prior to the change in strategy.' By 2023, Disney shifted toward more confident strategic investment, stating that it expected DTC investments to 'lead to growth in subscription fees and advertising revenues that will more than offset impacts on affiliate fees and advertising revenue from declines in linear network subscribers.' In 2024, Disney's relationship with DTC offerings became more operationally critical, as it noted that DTC streaming services 'compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors' DTC offerings' and that subscription fees and advertising rates were being impacted by competitive pressures. This evolution shows a shift from cautious investment in 2022 to a more integrated and strategically dependent posture by 2024, despite growing competitive intensity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DIS(2022) \u2192 DTC Offerings: Disney expressed uncertainty about the financial performance of its DTC strategy, noting that costs 'may continue to grow or be reduced more slowly than anticipated' and that returns on new investments 'may be negative or lower than prior to the change in strategy.'",
        "Hop 2: DIS(2023) \u2192 DTC Offerings: Disney took a more optimistic stance, stating that investments in DTC offerings were expected to 'lead to growth in subscription fees and advertising revenues that will more than offset impacts on affiliate fees and advertising revenue from declines in linear network subscribers.'",
        "Hop 3: DIS(2024) \u2192 DTC Offerings: Disney's DTC streaming services were described as central to its business, facing increasing competition and impacting pricing dynamics, with the company noting that DTC offerings 'compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors' DTC offerings' and that subscription fees and advertising rates were under pressure."

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nretail stores; and we have announced exploration of a number of new types of businesses. In addition, with the recent change in leadership, there may be additional adjustments to our business strategies. Our new organization and strategies are, among other things, subject to execution risk and may not produce the anticipated benefits, such as supporting our growth strategies and enhancing shareholder value. For example, notwithstanding our announced plans to rationalize costs, the costs of our DTC strategy, and associated losses, may continue to grow or be reduced more slowly than anticipated, which may impact our distribution strategy across businesses/distribution platforms, the types of content we distribute through various businesses/distribution platforms, and the timing and sequencing of content windows. Our new organization and strategies could be less successful than our previous organizational structure and strategies. In addition, external events including changing technology, changing consumer purchasing patterns, acceptance of content offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. When these changes or events occur, we have incurred and may continue to incur costs to change our business strategy and have needed and may in the future need to write-down the value of assets. For example, current conditions, including COVID-19 and our business decisions, have reduced the value of some of our assets. We have impaired goodwill and intangible assets at our International Channels businesses and impaired the value of certain of our retail store assets. We may write-down other assets as our strategy evolves to account for the current business environment. We also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. In recent years, such investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme parks, expansion of our fleet of cruise ships, the acquisition of TFCF and investments related to DTC offerings. Some of these investments have returns that are negative or low, the ultimate business prospects of the businesses related to these investments are uncertain, these investments may impact the profitability of our other businesses, and these risks are exacerbated by COVID-19. In any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be negative or lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. Even if our strategies are effective in the long term, our new offerings will generally not be profitable in the short term, growth of our new offerings is unlikely to be even quarter over quarter and we may not expand into new markets as or when anticipated. Our ability to forecast for new businesses may be impacted by our lack of experience operating in those new businesses, speed with which the competitive landscape changes, volatility beyond our control (such as the events beyond our control noted above) and our ability to obtain or develop the content and rights on which our projections are based. Accordingly, we may not achieve our forecasted outcomes.\n\n## Increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs.\n\nWe face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. This includes, among other types, competition for human resources, content and other resources we require in operating our business. For example:\n\n- Our programming and production operations compete to obtain creative, performing and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support and market share with other studio operators, television networks, SVOD providers and other new sources of broadband delivered content.\n- Our television networks and stations and DTC offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with other television and SVOD services, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations. In addition, we increasingly face competition for advertising sales from internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means.\n- Our television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.\n- Our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities.\n- Our content sales/licensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.\n- Our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of IP.\n- Our DTC businesses compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors' DTC offerings, all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment, as well as for technology, creative, performing and business talent and for content.\n\nCompetition in each of these areas may further increase as a result of technological developments and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels. Increased competition may increase the cost of programming and other products and divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs.\n\nCompetition for the acquisition of resources can further increase the cost of producing our products and services, deprive us of talent necessary to produce high quality creative material or increase the cost of compensation for our employees. Such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks and DTC offerings, parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues.",

This includes, among other types, competition for human resources, content and other resources we require in operating our business. For example:\n\n- Our programming and production operations compete to obtain creative, performing, production and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support, production facilities and market share with traditional and new media platforms, including other video-on-demand services and sources of broadband delivered content, studio operators and television networks.\n- Our television networks and stations and DTC offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with traditional and new media platforms, including other television and video-on-demand services and various forms of internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations.\n- Our television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.\n- Our theme parks and resorts and experiences compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities and compete for technology, creative, performing and business talent, including with other theme park and resort operators.\n- Our content sales/licensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.\n- Our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of IP.\n- Our DTC streaming services compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors' DTC offerings, all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment, as well as for technology, creative, performing and business talent and for content.\n\nTechnological developments, including developments in generative AI tools that can be used to create competing low-cost content, and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels, increase competition in these areas. Increased competition raises the cost of programming, including for sports and other products, and diverts consumers from our products and services or to other products and services or other forms of entertainment and experiences. In addition, given the nature of travel planning, consumers typically delay their consumption of certain of our products and services, such as our theme parks and resorts, in connection with planned major product launches of regional travel industry competitors. Each of these competitive pressures could reduce our revenue and increase our marketing costs.\n\nCompetition for the acquisition of resources can further increase the cost of producing our products and services; change the composition of our offerings, including sports; deprive us of talent needed for our entertainment and experiences businesses, including the talent necessary to produce high quality creative material; increase employee turnover and staffing instability; or increase our labor costs. Competition also reduces, or limits growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our linear networks and DTC offerings, parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues.\n\n## We face risks related to the renewal of long-term programming or distribution contracts on sufficiently favorable terms.\n\nWe enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. As these contracts expire, we renew or renegotiate the contracts, which from time to time has led to service blackouts when distribution contracts expired before renewal terms were agreed. We may lose programming rights or distribution rights if we are unable to renew these contracts on acceptable terms. As a result, our portfolio of acquired programming rights, such as sporting events, and the distributors of our programming and the portfolio of programming rights our distributors acquire have changed and will continue to change over time. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining certain programming rights has increased and may continue to increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical ex perience) and programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution channels, demand terms (including with respect to the pricing for, and the nature and amount of, programming distributed) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical ex perience. For ex ample, the terms of recent renewals of carriage agreements have included fewer of our linear networks or the opportunity to offer multiple genre-specific bundle options of fewer than all our linear networks while providing for certain of our DTC streaming services to be made available to the distributor's subscribers. Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms is affected by a number of factors, such as consolidation in the market for program distribution and the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and programming rights costs increases, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences.

By fiscal 2023 and 2024, the company still adhered to this 10% threshold but reported that balances with individual financial institutions exceeded this limit, reaching 24% of total cash and cash equivalents by the end of fiscal 2024.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Google consistently monetized advertising inventory through Google Ad Manager on Google Network properties using impression-based and click-based revenue models. In 2022, Google recognized impression-based revenues by dividing total impression-based and click-based revenues by the number of impressions, with a focus on cost-per-impression as a key metric. In 2023, Google clarified that it generally reports advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, meaning the full amount billed to customers is recorded as revenue. This approach remained consistent in 2024, with further emphasis on the company's role as principal in these transactions, reinforcing its control over the advertising inventory and supporting the gross revenue recognition model. The evolution shows a consistent monetization strategy with increasing transparency and accounting clarity over time.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\n\nWe generate revenues by deliv ering relev ant, cost-effectiv e online adv ertising; cloud-based solutions that prov ide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform serv ices, and applications; sales of other products and serv ices, such as fees receiv ed for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and dev ices.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the v ariable interest and v oting models. Intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported  and  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  notes. Actual  results  could  differ  materially  from  these  estimates  due  to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we ev aluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair v alues of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inv entory; and useful liv es of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believ ed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying v alues of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or serv ices is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or serv ices is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from rev enues.\n\n## Advertising Revenues\n\nWe generate advertising rev enues primarily by deliv ering adv ertising on:\n\n- Google  Search  and  other  properties,  including  rev enues  from  traffic  generated  by  search  distribution  partners  who  use  Google.com  as  their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube properties; and\n- Google Network properties, including rev enues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\n\nOur  customers  generally  purchase  adv ertising  inv entory  through  Google Ads,  Google Ad  Manager,  Google  Display  &amp;  Video  360,  and  Google Marketing Platform, among others.\n\nWe offer adv ertising by deliv ering both performance and brand adv ertising. We recognize rev enues for performance adv ertising when a user engages with the adv ertisement. For brand adv ertising, we recognize rev enues when the ad is displayed, or a user v iews the ad.\n\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we ev aluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report rev enues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report rev enues on a net basis). Generally, we report adv ertising rev enues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as rev enues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of rev enues. Where we are the principal,  we  control  the  adv ertising  inv entory  before  it  is  transferred  to  our  customers.  Our  control  is  ev idenced  by  our  sole  ability  to  monetize  the advertising inv entory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and hav ing a lev el of discretion in establishing pricing.\n\n## Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\n\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and dev ices rev enues consist of rev enues from:",

      "question": "How did Google's strategic emphasis on the Pixel family of devices evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of its positioning within the broader hardware revenue stream and long-term investment strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Google emphasized long-term investment in hardware, specifically highlighting the Pixel 5a 5G and Pixel 6 phones as part of a broader family of devices aimed at integrating AI, software, and hardware to improve user experiences. By 2023, the Pixel family was more clearly defined as a core component of the 'devices' revenue segment under 'Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices,' indicating a more structured approach to hardware monetization. In 2024, the Pixel devices remained central to the devices revenue category, with continued focus on integration with AI technologies like Gemini, suggesting a strategic evolution from a user-centric hardware play to a more integrated AI-driven ecosystem. This progression reveals a shift from investment and innovation focus to a mature product line with deeper integration into Google's broader AI and cloud infrastructure.",

We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people's lives easier by combining the best of our AI, software and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products such as Pixel 5a 5G and Pixel 6 phones, the Fitbit Charge 5, Chromecast with Google TV, and the new Google Nest Cams and Nest Doorbell. Creating products that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long run.\n\nThe key to building helpful products for users is our commitment to privacy, security, and user choice. We protect user privacy and security with products that are secure by default and private by design, and that keep users in control of their data.  Our  privacy-preserving  technologies  safeguard  individual  privacy  and  enhance  data  protection.  As  the  Internet evolves, so does our approach to privacy and security. We continue to enhance our anti-malware features in Chrome and drive improvements such as auto-delete controls that automatically delete web and app searches after 18 months. And we continue to keep users and their passwords safe through advances like our built-in password manager.\n\n## How we make money\n\nWe have built  world-class  advertising  technologies  for  advertisers,  agencies,  and  publishers  to  power  their  digital marketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies.\n\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on Google Search &amp; other properties, YouTube and Google Network partners' properties (\"Google Network properties\"). We continue  to  invest  in  both  performance  and  brand  advertising  and  seek  to  improve  the  measurability  of  advertising  so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n\n- Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on, leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n- Brand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services, through videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.\n\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering out invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\n\nWe continue to look to the future and are making long-term investments that we expect to grow revenues beyond advertising, including revenues from Google Play, hardware, and YouTube non-advertising.\n\n- Google Play generates revenues from sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store.\n- Hardware generates revenues from sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, Pixel phones, and other devices.\n- YouTube non-advertising generates revenues from YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions and other services.\n\n## Google Cloud\n\nGoogle  was  a  company  built  in  the  cloud.  We  continue  to  invest  in  infrastructure,  security,  data  management, analytics,  and  AI.  We  see  significant  opportunity  in  helping  businesses  utilize  these  strengths  with  features  like  data migration,  modern  development  environments,  and  machine  learning  tools  to  provide  enterprise-ready  cloud  services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. Google Cloud Platform enables developers to build, test, and deploy  applications  on  its  highly  scalable  and  reliable  infrastructure.  Google  Workspace  collaboration  tools  -  which include apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet and more - are designed with real-time collaboration and machine intelligence  to  help  people  work  smarter.  Because  more  and  more  of  today's  digital  experiences  are  being  built  in  the cloud, Google Cloud products help businesses of all sizes take advantage of the latest technology advances to operate more efficiently.\n\n- Google Cloud Platform generates revenues from infrastructure, platform and other services.",

We report rev enues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app dev elopers and end users for which we earn a serv ice fee.\n\n## Google Cloud Revenues\n\nGoogle Cloud rev enues consist of rev enues from:\n\n- Google  Cloud  Platform,  which  generates  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  for  infrastructure,  platform,  and  other  serv ices.  T hese serv ices  prov ide  access  to  solutions  such  as AI  offerings  including  our AI  infrastructure,  Vertex AI  platform,  and  Gemini  for  Google  Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n- Google  Workspace, which includes subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as  Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Driv e, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\n- other enterprise serv ices.\n\nOur cloud serv ices are generally prov ided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may hav e contract terms longer than a year. Rev enues related to cloud serv ices prov ided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer utilizes the serv ices, based on the quantity of serv ices consumed. Revenues related to cloud serv ices prov ided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably ov er the contract term as the customer receiv es and consumes the benefits of the cloud serv ices.\n\n## Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate rev enues to each performance obligation based on its relativ e standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\n\n## Customer Incentives and Credits\n\nCertain customers receiv e cash-based incentiv es or credits, which are accounted for as v ariable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce rev enues. We believ e that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration related to customer incentiv es and credits.\n\n## Sales Commissions\n\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of rev enues consists of TAC and other costs of rev enues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make av ailable our search access points and serv ices. Our distribution partners include browser prov iders, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software dev elopers; and\n- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of rev enues includes:\n- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  prov iders  from  whom  we  license  v ideo  and  other  content  for  distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content prov iders based on rev enues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;",

      "answer": "The value of Google's marketable equity securities under long-term lock-up restrictions was $1.4 billion in 2022, decreased to $803 million in 2023, and then returned to $1.4 billion by 2024.

      "answer": "In 2022, Google disclosed exposure to health and safety claims in the context of an expanding suite of products and services, including hardware and Google Cloud offerings, with potential liability tied to product defects. By 2023, the company noted it 'may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, AI training, development, and commercialization, or service disruptions or failures,' indicating a broadening scope of litigation risk as its AI and hardware businesses grew. In 2024, Google specifically cited being 'subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects' and reiterated exposure to health and safety litigation, even as it faced high-profile antitrust lawsuits and remedies that could alter its business model. The consistent thread across all three years is that as Google expanded into new product categories and technologies, its exposure to health and safety litigation grew in parallel, with increasing specificity in disclosures about hardware, AI, and environmental factors.",

Other countries, including Singapore, Australia, and the  United  Kingdom,  have  implemented  or  are  considering  similar  legislation  imposing  penalties  for  failure  to remove certain types of content.\n- Various legislative, litigation, and regulatory activity regarding our Google Play billing policies and business model, which could result in monetary penalties, damages and/or prohibition.\n- Various legislative and regulatory activity requiring disclosure of information about the operation of our services and  algorithms,  which  may  make  it  easier  for  websites  to  artificially  promote  low-quality,  deceptive,  or  harmful content on services like Google Search and YouTube, potentially harming the quality of our services.\n\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these laws, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain and could harm our business. For example:\n\n- We rely  on  statutory  safe  harbors,  as  set  forth  in  the  Digital  Millennium  Copyright Act  and  Section  230  of  the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, against liability for various linking, caching, and hosting activities. Any legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us. There are legislative proposals in both the U.S. and EU that could reduce our safe harbor protection.\n- Court decisions such as the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on May 13, 2014 on the 'right to be forgotten,' which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results about them in certain instances, may limit the content we can show to our users and impose significant operational burdens.\n\nThe  introduction  of  new  businesses,  products,  services,  and  technologies,  our  activities  in  certain  jurisdictions,  or other  actions  we  take  have  subjected  us,  and  will  likely  continue  to  subject  us,  to  additional  laws  and  regulations.  Our investment  in  a  variety  of  new  fields,  such  as  healthcare  and  payment  services,  has  expanded,  and  will  continue  to expand, the scope of regulations that apply to our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high  and  are  likely  to  increase  in  the  future. Any  failure  on  our  part  to  comply  with  laws  and  regulations  can  result  in negative  publicity  and  diversion  of  management  time  and  effort  and  may  subject  us  to  significant  liabilities  and  other penalties.\n\n## We are subject to claims, suits, government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees that may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  claims,  suits,  government  investigations,  other  proceedings,  and  consent  decrees  involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Due to our manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of products and services, including hardware as well as Google Cloud offerings, we also are subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation. We may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, or service disruptions or failures.\n\nAny  of  these  types  of  legal  proceedings  can  have  an  adverse  effect  on  us  because  of  legal  costs,  diversion  of management resources, negative publicity and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n## We may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content.\n\nOur products and services let users exchange information, advertise products and services, conduct business, and engage in various online activities.

We cannot guarantee that our goals and initiativ es will be fully realized on the timelines we expect or at all, and projects that are completed as planned may not achiev e the results we anticipate.\n\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, enforcement actions, consent  orders,  and  other  forms  of  regulatory  s crutiny  and  legal  liability,  including  competition  matters ,  that  could  harm  our  bus ines s , reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and gov ernment inquiries and inv estigations, other proceedings, and orders inv olv ing competition, intellectual  property,  data  priv acy  and  security,  tax  and  related  compliance,  labor  and  employment,  commercial  disputes,  content  generated  by  our users, goods and serv ices offered by adv ertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), v arious U.S. states, and other plaintiffs hav e filed, and may continue to file in the future, sev eral antitrust lawsuits about v arious aspects of our business, including our adv ertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the operation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store.\n\nFor example, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit alleging that Google v iolated antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising, and in August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google v iolated such antitrust laws. T he Court is holding  a  separate  proceeding  to  determine  remedies,  which  could  include  alterations  to  our  products  and  serv ices  and  our  business  models  and operations,  including  structural  remedies,  and/or  our  distribution  arrangements,  among  other  changes.  While  we  plan  to  appeal,  there  can  be  no assurance that our appeal will succeed, or that we will be able to change or decrease the sev erity of any remedies that may be ordered, and any or all of these potential remedies could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nAlso, in December 2023, a California jury deliv ered a v erdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google v iolated antitrust laws relating to Google Play's  business.  T he  presiding  judge  issued  a  remedies  decision  in  October  2024  that  ordered  a  v ariety  of  alterations  to  our  business  models  and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing the v erdict, but if we are unsuccessful, we could face significant expenses to implement the remedies, and such costs and alterations could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nFurthermore, in December 2020, sev eral State Attorneys General, led by the T exas Attorney General, filed an antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of T exas alleging that Google v iolated antitrust and other laws relating to its adv ertising technology. T his case is set for trial in  March 2025, and we could face significant civ il penalties. In January 2023, the DOJ and sev eral Attorneys General sued in the Eastern District of Virginia  alleging  similar  antitrust  v iolations  relating  to  Google's  adv ertising  technology.  T rial  in  the  DOJ  matter  concluded  in  September  2024  with  a decision  expected  in  early  2025.  If  we  are  unsuccessful,  we  could  face  an  order  on  remedies  that  could  harm  our  business,  reputation,  financial condition, and operating results.\n\nIn addition to these regulatory proceedings, priv ate indiv idual and collectiv e actions that ov erlap with claims pursued by regulators are pending in the U.S. and in sev eral other jurisdictions. Adv erse results in these or similar future lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages and remedies that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nOther regulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies, and data protection authorities, hav e challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. We are cooperating with these inv estigations and defending litigation or appealing decisions where appropriate.\n\nWe are also subject to a v ariety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation, and we may also be subject to claims inv olv ing health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other env ironmental effects, AI training, dev elopment, and commercialization, or serv ice disruptions or failures.

      "question": "How has Disney's strategic positioning of Marvel evolved across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in terms of its branding within streaming services and as a component of Disney's indefinite-lived intangible assets?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Marvel was listed alongside ESPN and Pixar as part of Disney's indefinite-lived intangible assets, indicating its long-term brand value. This was reaffirmed in 2024, showing continued recognition of Marvel's brand strength. In 2023, Marvel was specifically highlighted as a top-level branded tile within the Disney+ interface, underscoring its importance in driving subscriber engagement on Disney's key DTC platform. The consistent inclusion of Marvel in intangible assets across 2022 and 2024, combined with its prominent branding role in Disney+ in 2023, demonstrates Disney's strategic emphasis on leveraging Marvel's brand equity across both financial and content distribution dimensions over the three-year period.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Disney's human capital strategy increasingly emphasized both employee representation and comprehensive well-being initiatives. In 2022, the company highlighted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) efforts, including over 100 employee-led Business Employee Resource Groups (BERGs) to support underrepresented communities. By 2023, Disney expanded its focus to include a broader set of well-being programs, such as free mental health resources, global well-being events, and the establishment of two Centers for Living Well in Orlando, offering on-demand access to physicians and counselors. In 2024, Disney maintained these well-being initiatives while continuing to emphasize the role of employee associations and collective bargaining agreements, particularly for theme park and production staff.

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's theme parks and resorts as well as Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club compete with other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. The profitability of the leisure-time industry may be influenced by various factors that are not directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations, health concerns, the political environment, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure time, oil and transportation prices, weather patterns and natural disasters. The licensing and retail business competes with other licensors, retailers and publishers of character, brand and celebrity names, as well as other licensors, publishers and developers of game software, online video content, websites, other types of home entertainment and retailers of toys and kids merchandise.\n\nAll of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on a year-round basis. Typically, theme park attendance and resort occupancy fluctuate based on the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities, the opening of new guest offerings and pricing and promotional offers. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods. In addition, theme park and resort revenues may be higher during significant celebrations such as theme park or character anniversaries and lower in the periods following such celebrations. The licensing, retail and wholesale businesses are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the Company's first and fourth fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases and cable programming broadcasts.\n\n## STAR INDIA TRANSACTION\n\nThe Company and Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) plan to close a transaction on or about November 14, 2024, which will form a joint venture that combines our Star-branded and other general entertainment and sports television channels and direct-to-consumer Disney+ Hotstar service in India (Star India) and certain media and entertainment businesses controlled by RIL (the Star India Transaction) (see Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nThe Company's key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, the Company's human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefit and perquisite programs; enhance the Company's culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; engage employees as brand ambassadors of the Company's content, products and experiences; and evolve and invest in technology, tools and resources to enable employees at work.\n\nThe Company employed approximately 233,000 people as of September 28, 2024, of which approximately 171,000 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 62,000 were employed outside the U.S. Our global workforce comprises approximately 76% full time and 16% part time employees, with another 8% being seasonal employees. A significant number of employees in various parts of our businesses, including employees of our theme parks, and writers, directors, actors and production personnel for our productions are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, some of our employees outside the U.S. are represented by works councils, trade unions or other employee associations.\n\nSome of our key programs and initiatives to attract, develop and retain our diverse workforce include:\n\n- Health, financial, family resources, well-being and other benefits: Disney's benefit offerings are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of our diverse employees and their families. These benefit offerings for eligible employees include:\n- Healthcare options aimed at improving quality of care while limiting out-of-pocket costs\n- Retirement and savings programs that help employees adapt to changing needs and unexpected events and drive financial security in the present and the future\n- Family care resources, such as childcare and senior care programs, long-term care coverage and a family building benefit\n- Paid time-off programs, including vacation and sick and family care leave\n- Free mental health and well-being resources\n- Global well-being programs, including in-person offerings through campus health clubs and virtual and onsite events and activities focused on physical, emotional, financial and social well-being\n- Two Centers for Living Well in the Orlando area that offer convenient, on-demand access to board-certified physicians and counselors",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## PART I\n\n## ITEM 1. Business\n\nThe Walt Disney Company, together with its subsidiaries, is a diversified worldwide entertainment company with operations in two segments: Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution (DMED) and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products (DPEP).\n\nThe terms 'Company', 'we', 'our' and 'us' are used in this report to refer collectively to the parent company and the subsidiaries through which businesses are conducted.\n\n## COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme park and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruption of content production activities.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 related disruptions on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the currently unknowable duration and severity of COVID-19 and its variants, and among other things, governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests and talent.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nThe Company's key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, the Company's human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefit, and perquisite programs; enhance the Company's culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; engage employees as brand ambassadors of the Company's content, products and experiences; and evolve and invest in technology, tools, and resources to enable employees at work.\n\nThe Company employed approximately 220,000 people as of October 1, 2022, of which approximately 166,000 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 54,000 were employed internationally. Our global workforce is comprised of approximately 78% full time and 15% part time employees, with another 7% being seasonal employees. A significant number of employees in various parts of our businesses, including employees of our theme parks, and writers, directors, actors and production personnel for our productions are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, some of our employees outside the U.S. are represented by works councils, trade unions or other employee associations.\n\nSome of our key programs and initiatives to attract, develop and retain our diverse workforce include:\n\n- Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&amp;I): Our DE&amp;I objectives are to build teams that reflect the life experiences of our audiences, while employing and supporting a diverse array of voices in our creative and production teams. Our DE&amp;I initiatives and programs include:\n- The Company's Reimagine Tomorrow efforts, which build on Disney's longstanding commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, and features a website, Disney's first large-scale platform for amplifying underrepresented voices\n- Executive Incubator, Creative Talent Development and Inclusion, and the Disney Launchpad: Shorts Incubator, which are designed to create a pipeline of next-generation creative executives from underrepresented backgrounds\n- Development programs, which target underrepresented talent\n- Innovative learning opportunities, which spark dialogue among employees, leaders, Disney talent and external experts\n- Over 100 employee-led Business Employee Resource Groups (BERGs), which represent and support the diverse communities that make up our workforce\n- The Disney Look appearance guidelines, which were updated to cultivate a more inclusive environment that encourages and celebrates authentic expressions of belonging among employees",

      "question": "How did Disney's reliance on Industrial Light & Magic for post-production services evolve between fiscal years 2022 and 2024, particularly in relation to the company's shifting content distribution strategy across theatrical, DTC, and third-party licensing channels?",
      "answer": "Disney consistently engaged Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) for post-production services throughout fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, as evidenced by its inclusion in the Content Sales/Licensing section each year. In 2022, ILM was explicitly named alongside Skywalker Sound as a contributor to post-production services within this segment. This pattern continued in 2023 and 2024, with ILM remaining a core provider of post-production capabilities as Disney expanded its DTC offerings and adjusted theatrical distribution strategies. Notably, Disney released approximately 1,100 full-length live-action films and 100 full-length animated films cumulatively through 2024, many of of which would have required ILM\u2019s visual effects and post-production support. Additionally, as Disney increasingly distributed certain films exclusively via DTC services like Disney+ starting in some territories, the ongoing mention of ILM in the filings suggests a sustained or potentially growing dependency on its services despite distribution shifts. However, the filings do not provide specific financial metrics to quantify the change in reliance on ILM over this period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [DIS](2023) \u2192 [Industrial Light & Magic]: ILM is listed as a provider of post-production services under Content Sales/Licensing and Other, indicating continued use of its capabilities.",
        "Hop 2: [DIS](2024) \u2192 [Industrial Light & Magic]: ILM is again referenced in the Content Sales/Licensing section for post-production, despite Disney's increased emphasis on DTC distribution and bundling strategies.",
        "Hop 3: [DIS](2022) \u2192 [Industrial Light & Magic]: ILM is named as a post-production service provider alongside Skywalker Sound, showing early inclusion in Disney\u2019s external production ecosystem."

These activities are reported with Content Sales/Licensing.\n\n## TV/SVOD Distribution\n\nAlthough we generally intend to use our film and television content on our DTC services and linear networks in TV/SVOD windows, we also license our content to third-party television networks, television stations and other video service providers for distribution to viewers on television or a variety of internet-connected devices, including through other DTC services.\n\n## Theatrical Distribution\n\nThe Company licenses full-length live-action and animated films from the Company's Studio production groups to theaters globally. Cumulatively through October 1, 2022, the Company has released approximately 1,100 full-length live-action films and 100 full-length animated films. In the domestic and most major international markets, we generally distribute and market our films directly. In certain international markets our films are distributed by independent companies.

      "question": "How did Disney's strategic investment and competitive positioning in its DTC offerings evolve from fiscal years 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression reveal about the financial risks and market pressures associated with scaling its streaming services?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney acknowledged the growing costs of its DTC strategy and the uncertainty around returns, noting that losses from DTC offerings might continue to grow or reduce more slowly than anticipated. By 2023, Disney shifted toward more active investment in DTC offerings, aiming to drive growth in subscription and advertising revenues despite declining linear network subscribers. In fiscal 2024, the company emphasized the competitive pressures impacting its DTC offerings, including rising costs, pricing constraints, and intensified competition from other streaming platforms. This progression reveals a strategic pivot toward scaling DTC despite increasing financial risk and market pressures, with the company doubling down on investment even as it faced rising costs and uncertain profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Increased competitive pressures impact our revenues, increase our costs and impact the profitability of our businesses.\n\nWe face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. This includes, among other types, competition for human resources, content and other resources we require in operating our business. For example:\n\n- Our programming and production operations compete to obtain creative, performing, production and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support, production facilities and market share with traditional and new media platforms, including other video-on-demand services and sources of broadband delivered content, studio operators and television networks.\n- Our television networks and stations and DTC offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with traditional and new media platforms, including other television and video-on-demand services and various forms of internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations.\n- Our television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.\n- Our theme parks and resorts and experiences compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities and compete for technology, creative, performing and business talent, including with other theme park and resort operators.\n- Our content sales/licensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.\n- Our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of IP.\n- Our DTC streaming services compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors' DTC offerings, all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment, as well as for technology, creative, performing and business talent and for content.\n\nTechnological developments, including developments in generative AI tools that can be used to create competing low-cost content, and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels, increase competition in these areas. Increased competition raises the cost of programming, including for sports and other products, and diverts consumers from our products and services or to other products and services or other forms of entertainment and experiences. In addition, given the nature of travel planning, consumers typically delay their consumption of certain of our products and services, such as our theme parks and resorts, in connection with planned major product launches of regional travel industry competitors. Each of these competitive pressures could reduce our revenue and increase our marketing costs.\n\nCompetition for the acquisition of resources can further increase the cost of producing our products and services; change the composition of our offerings, including sports; deprive us of talent needed for our entertainment and experiences businesses, including the talent necessary to produce high quality creative material; increase employee turnover and staffing instability; or increase our labor costs. Competition also reduces, or limits growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our linear networks and DTC offerings, parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues.\n\n## We face risks related to the renewal of long-term programming or distribution contracts on sufficiently favorable terms.\n\nWe enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. As these contracts expire, we renew or renegotiate the contracts, which from time to time has led to service blackouts when distribution contracts expired before renewal terms were agreed. We may lose programming rights or distribution rights if we are unable to renew these contracts on acceptable terms. As a result, our portfolio of acquired programming rights, such as sporting events, and the distributors of our programming and the portfolio of programming rights our distributors acquire have changed and will continue to change over time. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining certain programming rights has increased and may continue to increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical ex perience) and programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution channels, demand terms (including with respect to the pricing for, and the nature and amount of, programming distributed) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical ex perience. For ex ample, the terms of recent renewals of carriage agreements have included fewer of our linear networks or the opportunity to offer multiple genre-specific bundle options of fewer than all our linear networks while providing for certain of our DTC streaming services to be made available to the distributor's subscribers. Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms is affected by a number of factors, such as consolidation in the market for program distribution and the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and programming rights costs increases, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences.

In addition, with the recent change in leadership, there may be additional adjustments to our business strategies. Our new organization and strategies are, among other things, subject to execution risk and may not produce the anticipated benefits, such as supporting our growth strategies and enhancing shareholder value. For example, notwithstanding our announced plans to rationalize costs, the costs of our DTC strategy, and associated losses, may continue to grow or be reduced more slowly than anticipated, which may impact our distribution strategy across businesses/distribution platforms, the types of content we distribute through various businesses/distribution platforms, and the timing and sequencing of content windows. Our new organization and strategies could be less successful than our previous organizational structure and strategies. In addition, external events including changing technology, changing consumer purchasing patterns, acceptance of content offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. When these changes or events occur, we have incurred and may continue to incur costs to change our business strategy and have needed and may in the future need to write-down the value of assets. For example, current conditions, including COVID-19 and our business decisions, have reduced the value of some of our assets. We have impaired goodwill and intangible assets at our International Channels businesses and impaired the value of certain of our retail store assets. We may write-down other assets as our strategy evolves to account for the current business environment. We also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. In recent years, such investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme parks, expansion of our fleet of cruise ships, the acquisition of TFCF and investments related to DTC offerings. Some of these investments have returns that are negative or low, the ultimate business prospects of the businesses related to these investments are uncertain, these investments may impact the profitability of our other businesses, and these risks are exacerbated by COVID-19. In any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be negative or lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring. Even if our strategies are effective in the long term, our new offerings will generally not be profitable in the short term, growth of our new offerings is unlikely to be even quarter over quarter and we may not expand into new markets as or when anticipated. Our ability to forecast for new businesses may be impacted by our lack of experience operating in those new businesses, speed with which the competitive landscape changes, volatility beyond our control (such as the events beyond our control noted above) and our ability to obtain or develop the content and rights on which our projections are based. Accordingly, we may not achieve our forecasted outcomes.\n\n## Increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs.\n\nWe face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. This includes, among other types, competition for human resources, content and other resources we require in operating our business. For example:\n\n- Our programming and production operations compete to obtain creative, performing and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support and market share with other studio operators, television networks, SVOD providers and other new sources of broadband delivered content.\n- Our television networks and stations and DTC offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with other television and SVOD services, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations. In addition, we increasingly face competition for advertising sales from internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means.\n- Our television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.\n- Our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities.\n- Our content sales/licensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.\n- Our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of IP.\n- Our DTC businesses compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors' DTC offerings, all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment, as well as for technology, creative, performing and business talent and for content.\n\nCompetition in each of these areas may further increase as a result of technological developments and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels. Increased competition may increase the cost of programming and other products and divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs.\n\nCompetition for the acquisition of resources can further increase the cost of producing our products and services, deprive us of talent necessary to produce high quality creative material or increase the cost of compensation for our employees. Such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks and DTC offerings, parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix's strategy around membership plans evolved significantly. In 2022, the company acknowledged the risks associated with adjusting pricing or plans and noted that it may explore changes to pricing or service offerings. By 2023, Netflix had introduced a new, lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan and began increasing enforcement of its terms of use to limit multi-household usage, signaling a more proactive approach to monetizing different consumer segments and curbing account sharing. In 2024, the company continued to refine its pricing and plans, emphasizing the ad-supported tier and expanding live programming as part of its service enhancements. This evolution reveals a strategic shift toward diversifying its membership offerings to drive both retention and revenue growth, while addressing competitive pressures and changing consumer preferences.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\n## If our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe must continually add new members both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices that keep our members engaged with our service, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, films and games. Our penetration and growth rates have fluctuated and vary across the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by professional content creators, and more broadly other sources of entertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\n\nMembers cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, that they need to cut household expenses, dissatisfaction with content, a preference for competitive services and customer service issues that they believe are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, may also adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fix ed in nature, we may not be able to adjust our ex penditures or increase our (per membership) revenues, including by adjusting membership pricing, commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing members and attracting new members, our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## If we do not continuously provide value to our members, including making improvements to our service in a manner that is favorably received by them, our revenue, results of operations and business will be adversely affected.\n\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members, and accordingly, our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected. We expanded our entertainment video offering to include games and, more recently, live programming. If our efforts to sustain and improve our existing TV and film offering, as well as develop and expand our video entertainment options, are not done in a manner valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may also seek to extend our business into new products and services to help drive growth. For example, we continue to expand our offering of consumer products and live experiences. To the extent we cannot successfully find and develop new products, experiences and services to help drive growth, or we do not realize the expected benefits or generate additional revenue from such new products, experiences, and services, our future results of operations and growth may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe have and may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, including for example, the lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan. Similarly, we have increased enforcement of and will continue to enforce our terms of use to limit multi-household usage and shared viewing outside of a household. These and other adjustments we make may not be well-received by consumers, and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain members, revenue and our results of operations. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our ex isting members or adjustments to our service are not successful, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. We face competition from traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers and platforms. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant",

In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\n## If our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our penetration and growth rates vary between the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\n\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. We have recently expanded our entertainment video offering to include games. If our efforts to develop and offer games are not valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, which may not be wellreceived by consumers, and which may result in existing members canceling our service or fewer new members joining our service. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. While we currently permit multiple users within the same household to share a single account for non-commercial purposes, if multi-household usage is abused or if our efforts to restrict multi-household usage are ineffective, our ability to add new members may be hindered and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete",

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix disclosed that its content licensing and production payments required more upfront cash relative to amortization expense, indicating a capital-intensive model for original programming. By 2023, the company highlighted growing production risks tied to original content, including completion risk, key talent risk, and rising costs from guild payments and collective bargaining agreements, while also expanding studio operations through acquisitions like Scanline and Animal Logic. In 2024, Netflix noted the challenges of scaling original content internationally, addressing varied consumer customs, regulatory environments, and the operational complexity of managing global content production. Together, these disclosures show a shift from a primarily financial investment focus to a broader operational and strategic scaling challenge, with increasing emphasis on managing risk and localization in international markets.",

As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments.

As we scale our content production, including games, and introduce new features and expand our consumer products and experience offerings, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources, which requires significant resources and management attention. Further, we may expand our content and service offerings in a manner that is not well received by consumers.

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nNetflix, Inc. (the 'Company') was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approximately 222 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can engage as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, the Company continues to offer its DVD-by-mail service in the United States (\"U.S.\").\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Recently adopted accounting pronouncements\n\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740) . ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions for performing intraperiod tax allocations, recognizing deferred taxes for investments, and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The guidance also simplifies the accounting for franchise taxes, transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill, and the effect of enacted changes in tax laws or rates in interim periods. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 in the first quarter of 2021 and the adoption had no material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. While the Company is continuing to assess the timing of adoption and the potential impacts of ASU 2021-08, it does not expect ASU 2021-08 to have a material effect, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.\n\n## Content\n\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.",

By 2023, the company formally introduced an 'Amended and Restated Performance Bonus Plan' through an 8-K filing on December 9, 2022, signaling a strategic update to the plan. In 2024, the Performance Bonus Plan was further embedded into the broader executive compensation architecture, appearing alongside updated stock option agreements and severance plans, including the 'Executive Officer Severance Plan' and 'Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement,' suggesting a more integrated and mature compensation strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [NFLX](2023) \u2192 [Performance Bonus Plan]: Introduced the 'Amended and Restated Performance Bonus Plan' via 8-K filing on December 9, 2022.",
        "Hop 2: [NFLX](2024) \u2192 [Performance Bonus Plan]: The plan was referenced alongside updated executive compensation agreements, including performance-based RSUs and severance plans.",
        "Hop 3: [NFLX](2022) \u2192 [Performance Bonus Plan]: The plan was listed in the exhibit table under executive compensation, indicating its existence but without the updated formalization seen in later years."

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix's dependency on rights holders intensified due to rising competition for exclusive content, increased regulatory scrutiny, and growing risks around licensing agreements. In 2022, the company expressed concern over content providers launching their own streaming services, potentially limiting Netflix's access to popular content and increasing programming costs. By 2023, Netflix noted that license terms varied and that disputes over intellectual property could lead to content unavailability or service disruptions. In 2024, the company reiterated these risks and further highlighted regulatory changes in multiple jurisdictions\u2014such as content quotas and investment obligations\u2014that constrained its ability to control content offerings. This 3-year progression reveals a growing strategic challenge in maintaining a compelling and cost-effective content library amid external pressures from rights holders and regulators.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights ex tend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and the consumer products and experiences based thereon. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\n## REGULATION\n\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix . This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the ex tent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 14,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,600 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,200 (16%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 600 (4%) in Latin America and 1,600 (11%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year and may be covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe an important component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our employees to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of ex cellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. As our business grows and changes, we seek to improve our culture to meet the new needs of our business. We believe our dynamic culture helps us create a better ex perience for our members, employees, creators and partners.\n\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix  employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it's important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by educating our people leaders and recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\n\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer various experiences and training to inform our employees about our culture and other context that we believe is important for success at Netflix . We aim to equip our people leaders (officers, V Ps, directors, and manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic objectives.\n\nWe aim generally to pay our employees at their personal top of market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender identity (globally) and race or ethnicity (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\n\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\n\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n## If studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g. remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights could expose us to greater distribution expenses.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, CMCSA's shared data plan offerings within its wireless services evolved to reflect a more structured and flexible bundling strategy. In 2022, shared data plans were offered as part of bundled service offerings to residential customers who subscribed to broadband services, with options to activate multiple lines per account and choose between unlimited data plans, shared data plans, or per gigabyte pricing. By 2023, the company maintained the shared data plan option as part of its domestic wireless services but emphasized bundling with broadband, reinforcing integration across services. In 2024, CMCSA expanded its flexibility by introducing prepaid unlimited data plans under the NOW brand, while continuing to offer shared data plans as part of qualifying broadband bundles, thereby catering to a broader range of customer preferences. This progression shows a strategic move toward enhancing customer choice and deepening service integration.",

      "question": "How has the competitive threat from wireless telecommunications companies to CMCSA's broadband business evolved from 2022 to 2024, and what evidence suggests this pressure may be impacting CMCSA's market positioning or customer retention strategies?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the competitive threat from wireless telecommunications companies to CMCSA's broadband services has evolved significantly. In 2022, wireless providers were noted as offering 4G and 5G wireless broadband services, which directly competed with CMCSA\u2019s wireline broadband. By 2023, the emphasis shifted to 5G fixed wireless networks, with providers deploying technologies that enabled them to offer internet services using devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and mobile and fixed wireless routers. In 2024, wireless providers escalated their strategies by bundling DTC streaming services and offering unlimited data-usage plans, which could attract customers away from traditional broadband subscriptions. This progression shows an intensification of wireless companies' strategies, leveraging both technological advancements and service bundling to gain market share, which likely pressures CMCSA's broadband market positioning and necessitates customer retention innovations such as enhanced broadband speeds, improved customer experience, or bundled offerings.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nBelow is a summary of the most significant sources of competition; for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the 'Competition' discussion within that section.\n\n- Cable Communications' and Sky's broadband services compete primarily against wireline telecommunications companies, including many that are increasing deployment of fiber-based networks, wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services (such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services), certain electric cooperatives and municipalities in the United  States  that  own  and  operate  their  own  broadband  networks  and  DBS  and  newer  satellite  broadband  providers. Broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level, including as part of COVID-19 relief efforts as well as federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021, may result in other service providers deploying new subsidized internet access networks within our footprint. Competition for Cable Communications' video services consists primarily of DTC streaming and other  OTT  service  providers,  DBS  providers  and  telecommunications  companies  with  fiber-based networks.  Sky  faces  competition  for  its  video  services  from  cable  and  telecommunications  providers  in  its  European markets.  Our  voice  and  wireless  services  primarily  compete  with  wireless  and  wireline  telecommunications  providers. Many  of  our  competitors  offer  customers  bundled  products  and  services  with  favorable  pricing,  which  has  increased competition.\n- NBCUniversal  and  Sky  face  substantial  and  increasing  competition  from  providers  of  similar  types  of  entertainment, sports,  news  and  information  content,  as  well  as  from  other  forms  of  entertainment  and  recreational  activities. NBCUniversal  and  Sky  must  compete  to  obtain  talent,  popular  content  (including  sports  programming)  and  other resources required to successfully operate their businesses. This competition has intensified as DTC streaming and other OTT service providers seek to develop high-quality programming and acquire live sports programming to attract viewers.\n\nConsolidation  of,  or  cooperation  between,  our  competitors,  including  suppliers  and  distributors  of  content,  may  increase competition in all of these areas, as may the emergence of additional competitors with significant resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing and packaging, who are competing with our businesses in all forms of content distribution and production. For example, such consolidation or cooperation may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost  streaming  services,  potentially  on  an  exclusive  basis,  through  unlimited  data-usage  plans  for  internet  or  wireless  phone services.\n\nThe  ability  of  our  businesses  to  compete  effectively  also  depends  on  our  perceived  image  and  reputation  among  our  various constituencies,  including  our  customers,  consumers,  advertisers,  business  partners,  employees,  investors  and  government authorities. In addition, our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience.\n\n## Changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.\n\nDistribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming and other OTT services, the number of Cable Communications' video customers and amount of subscriber fees paid to NBCUniversal's television networks decrease, even as Cable Communications' broadband services have become more important to consumers. DTC streaming and other OTT services have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much they pay for such content.\n\nFor  example,  Cable  Communications  continues  to  experience  net  video  customer  losses.  In  Europe,  more  of  Sky's  new  video customers  have  recently  subscribed,  and  may  continue  to  subscribe,  to  NOW,  Sky's  DTC  streaming  service,  instead  of  its traditional  DTH  video  service.  Although  we  have  attempted  to  adapt  our  video  service  offerings  and  enhance  our  broadband services for changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying the X1 and Sky Q platforms, Flex, developing new smart televisions using our global technology platform at Sky and Cable Communications, and by offering Peacock, the continuing trend of content owners delivering their content directly to consumers rather than through, or in addition to, traditional video distribution channels continues to disrupt traditional distribution business models.\n\nThe  increase  in  DTC  streaming  and  other  OTT  service  providers  also  has  significantly  increased  the  number  of  entertainment choices available to consumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers. The use of DTC streaming and other OTT services reduce traditional television viewership,  and  coupled  with  time-shifting  technologies,  such  as  DVR  and  on  demand  services,  have  caused  and  likely  will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our television programming channels. In addition, as more programming providers offer  their  content  directly  to  consumers  through  their  own  apps  or  platforms,  they  may  reduce  the  quantity  and  quality  of  the programming they license to NBCUniversal or Sky's television channels or to Peacock.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

We compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, sports, news and information content to consumers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.\n\nBelow is a summary of our most significant sources of competition. Many of these competitors offer competitive pricing, packaging and/or bundling of services to customers, which further increases competition. For a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the 'Competition' discussion within that section.\n\n- Connectivity  &amp;  Platforms'  broadband  services  compete  primarily  against  wireline  telecommunications  companies,  including  many  that  are  increasing deployment of fiber-based networks; wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services (using a variety of technologies, including 5G  fixed wireless networks and 4G  and 5G  wireless broadband services); electric cooperatives and municipalities in the United States that own and operate their own broadband networks; and DBS and newer satellite broadband providers. Broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level may result in other service providers deploying new subsidized internet access networks within our footprint, and in cases where we receive subsidies, may impose constraints on how we conduct our businesses. For a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see '-We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses' below and Item 1: Business and refer to the 'Legislation and Regulation' discussion within that section.\n- Our wireless and voice services compete with both telecommunications and wireless telecommunication providers.\n- Competition for video services consists primarily of DTC streaming service providers and aggregators, DBS providers and telecommunications companies.\n- Business Services Connectivity primarily competes with wireline telecommunications companies and wide area network managed service providers.\n- Our businesses in Content &amp; Experiences, as well as our video business, face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of entertainment, sports, news and information content, as well as from other forms of entertainment, including from social networking and user-generated content,  as  well  as  tourism,  recreational  activities  and  lodging.  They  must  compete  to  obtain  talent,  popular  content  (including  sports  programming), advertising and other resources required to successfully operate their businesses. This competition has further intensified as certain DTC streaming service providers have commissioned, and may continue to commission, high-cost programming and acquire live sports programming rights to attract viewers at significant costs.\n\nCompetitors with significant resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing and packaging continue to increasingly compete with our businesses in all forms. Some of these competitors could also have preferential access to customer data or other competitive information. Further, consolidation of, or cooperation between, our competitors may increase competition in all of these areas. For example, cooperation between competitors may allow them to offer a range of products and services, including aggregating certain content into a stand-alone offering, offering free or lower cost DTC streaming services, potentially on an exclusive basis, through unlimited data-usage plans for broadband and wireless services or bundling DTC streaming services on their platforms.\n\nOur competitive position may be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience. In addition, our ability to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, business partners, employees, investors and government authorities. For example, some of these constituencies may have their own, and some have conflicting, environmental, social and governance priorities, which may present risks to our reputation and brands if these constituencies perceive misalignment.\n\n## Changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.\n\nDistribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content continue to challenge existing business models, increase the number of competitors that our businesses face, and have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much or for how long they pay for such content.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n18",

We also offer Ethernet network services, which  connect  multiple  locations  and  provide  higher  downstream  and  upstream  speed  options  to  medium-sized  customers  and larger enterprises, and advanced voice services, as well as video solutions for hotels and other large venues. In addition, we provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators to help manage their network bandwidth.\n\nOur business services offerings for medium-sized and enterprise customers also include a software-defined networking product, and larger enterprises may also receive support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services. These services are primarily provided to Fortune 1000 companies and other large enterprises with  multiple  locations  both  within  and  outside  of  our  cable  distribution  footprint,  where  we  provide  coverage  outside  of  our service areas through agreements with other companies to use their networks.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that our advertising business sells to local, regional and national advertisers as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks, and we also generate revenue from selling advertising on our digital  platforms.  Our  advertising  business  also  represents  the  advertising  sales  efforts  of  other  multichannel  video  providers  in some markets and offers additional technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate advertisers more effectively engaging with their target audiences.\n\n## Other\n\nOur security and automation services provide home monitoring services and the ability to manage other functions within the home, such as lighting and room temperature, through our online portal, mobile apps and the X1 platform. We also license our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers.\n\n## Network and Technology\n\nOur  Cable  Communications  cable  distribution  system  uses  a  hybrid  fiber-optic  and  coaxial  cable  network  that  we  believe  is sufficiently flexible and scalable to support our future technology requirements and enables us to continue to grow capacity and capabilities  over  time.  This  network  provides  the  two-way  transmissions  that  are  essential  to  providing  broadband  services, interactive  video  services  such  as  integrated  search  functionality,  On  Demand  and  DVR,  voice  services,  and  security  and automation  services.  Leveraging  DOCSIS  3.1  technology,  Cable  Communications  currently  deploys  broadband  services  with downstream speeds for residential customers up to over a gigabit per second across nearly our entire footprint. We continue to evolve and enhance our network and plan to leverage DOCSIS 4.0 technology to begin deploying multigigabit symmetrical speeds in the future. Additionally, Cable Communications has been automating many core network functions in order to expand capacity and increase operating efficiency and to identify and fix network issues before they affect our customers.\n\nCable  Communications  continues  to  focus  on  technology  initiatives  to  design,  develop  and  deploy  next-generation  media  and content  delivery  platforms,  such  as  the  X1  and  Flex  platforms  and  cloud  DVR  technology  that  use  Internet  Protocol  ('IP') technology and our own cloud network servers to deliver video and advanced search capability. These platforms are based on our global technology platform, which integrates linear television networks, certain owned and third-party DTC streaming services and other  internet-based  apps,  and  on  demand  content  in  one  unified  experience  with  voice-activated  remote  control  search  and interactive  features.  Cable  Communications  also  pursues  technology  initiatives  related  to  broadband  services  that  leverage  our global technology platform, providing customers with in-and-out-of-home Wi-Fi, the ability to manage their Wi-Fi network and connected home with our xFi whole-home application and online portal, advanced security technology and other features.\n\n## Sources of Supply and Other Operations\n\nTo offer video services, Cable Communications licenses substantial amounts of programming from cable and broadcast networks, as  well  as  from  local  broadcast  television  stations.  The  fees  associated  with  these  programming  distribution  agreements  are generally based on the number of subscribers who are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which the content is provided. We seek to include in distribution agreements the rights to offer such programming through multiple delivery platforms, such as through our On Demand service, online portal, mobile apps and Flex.\n\nFor  wireless  services,  we  have  an  MVNO  agreement  that  allows  us  to  offer  services  using  Verizon's  wireless  network  and  we purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of wireless handsets, tablets and smart watches that we sell to wireless customers.\n\nCable  Communications  purchases  from  a  limited  number  of  suppliers  a  significant  amount  of  customer  premise  equipment, including  wireless  gateways  and  set-top  boxes,  network  equipment  and  services  to  provide  services  to  residential  and  business customers.\n\nCable Communications uses two primary vendors to provide customer billing for our residential and business customers.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

These services have an operating system similar to Sky Q and are offered to customers through Sky Stream, which leverages a streaming device and Wi-Fi, or to customers that purchase our Sky G lass smart televisions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nAs part of our distribution agreements with domestic cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that our advertising business sells, and we also sell advertising on our Sky-branded entertainment television networks and on our digital platforms. We also enter into representation agreements under which we sell advertising on behalf of third parties both domestically and internationally. Additionally, we offer technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate effective engagement of advertisers with their target audiences.\n\n## Other\n\nWe offer residential wireline voice services primarily using interconnected V oice over Internet Protocol ('V oIP') technology, and we offer residential security and automation  services.  We  also  license  our  technology  platforms  to  other  multichannel  video  providers  and  distribute  certain  of  our  Sky-branded  entertainment television networks to third-party video service providers.\n\n## Business Services Connectivity Segment\n\nOur Business Services Connectivity segment consists of our domestic service offerings for small businesses, which include broadband, wireline voice and wireless services, as well as our enterprise solutions offerings for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises. Certain business customers subscribe to our video services, and the associated revenue is included in our Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segment. We also have certain business connectivity service offerings in the United Kingdom.\n\nOur domestic broadband offerings have a range of service levels, including fiber-based services that deliver symmetrical speeds ranging up to 100 gigabits per second.\n\nOur small business broadband, wireline voice and wireless service offerings are similar to those provided to our residential customers and also include cloud-based cybersecurity services, wireless backup connectivity, advanced Wi-Fi solutions, video monitoring services and other cloud-based services.\n\nOur enterprise solutions offerings also include ethernet network services, which connect multiple locations and provide higher downstream and upstream speed options, advanced voice services, and a software-defined networking product. Larger enterprises may also receive support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services.

      "question": "How did the competitive positioning of CMCSA against Lumen in fiber-based broadband services evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of network infrastructure advancements and service offerings?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Lumen consistently remained a key competitor to CMCSA in the broadband space, particularly in deploying fiber-based infrastructure that offered higher data transmission speeds. In 2022, Lumen was highlighted as one of several wireline telecom companies building fiber deeper into their networks, allowing them to offer faster broadband services in CMCSA's service areas. By 2023, this trend continued, with Lumen specifically mentioned alongside AT&T, Frontier, and Verizon as continuing to expand fiber-based infrastructure in the U.S., which enabled them to provide competitive, high-speed services. In 2024, Lumen remained a named competitor, with the added context that such companies were not only expanding fiber but also creating bundled offerings and increasing speeds to further compete with CMCSA. This 3-year progression shows a consistent and intensifying competitive threat from Lumen as it advanced its fiber infrastructure and service strategies, directly impacting CMCSA\u2019s market position.",

Our customer service teams also provide 24/7 call-answering capability, telemarketing and other services. Our technical services group performs various tasks, including installations, plant maintenance and upgrades to our cable distribution system. Customers can use self-service help and support and perform self-installations for certain services.\n\n## Competition\n\nCompetition for Cable Communications' services consists primarily of telecommunications companies with fiber-based networks, DTC streaming and other over-the-top ('OTT') service providers and direct broadcast satellite ('DBS') providers that typically offer features, pricing and packaging for services comparable to ours.\n\n## Residential\n\n## Broadband\n\nCable Communications competes with a number of companies offering internet services, including:\n\n- wireline telecommunications companies\n- wireless telecommunications companies\n- municipal broadband networks and power companies\n- satellite broadband providers\n\nCertain wireline telecommunications companies such as AT&amp;T, Frontier, Lumen and Verizon have built and are continuing to build fiber-based network infrastructure farther into their networks, which allows them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those  that  can  be  provided  with  traditional  DSL  technology,  and  are  offering  services  with  these  higher  speeds  in  many  of  our service areas. Certain companies that offer DSL service have increased data transmission speeds, lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our broadband services.\n\nCertain companies have launched fiber-to-the-home networks that provide broadband services in certain areas in which we operate, and certain municipalities in our service areas are also building fiber-based networks.\n\nVarious wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of technologies, including 4G and 5G, wireless broadband and  Wi-Fi  networks.  These  networks  work  with  devices  such  as  smartphones,  laptops,  tablets,  and  mobile  and  fixed  wireless routers, as well as wireless data cards. Moreover, broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level, including as part of COVID-19 relief efforts as well as federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021, may result in other service providers deploying  new  subsidized  internet  access  networks  within  our  footprint.  The  availability  of  these  and  other  offerings  could negatively impact the demand for our broadband services.\n\n## Video\n\nCable Communications competes with a number of different sources in the United States that provide news, sports, information and entertainment programming to consumers, including:\n\n- DTC streaming and other OTT service providers including:\n- subscription-based services, such as Disney+ and Netflix, that offer online services that enable internet streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming\n- virtual  multichannel  video  providers,  such  as  Hulu  +  Live  TV  and  YouTube  TV,  that  offer  streamed  linear programming networks\n- DBS providers, including DIRECTV and DISH Network, that transmit satellite signals to substantially all U.S. households to provide video programming and other information similar to our video services\n- companies, including AT&amp;T and Verizon, that have built and continue to build fiber-based networks that provide video services similar to ours, overlap a substantial portion of our service areas, and in some cases provide bundled offerings that include wireless phone services\n- other providers that build and operate communications systems and services in the same areas that we serve, including those operating as franchised cable operators\n- other  companies,  such  as  local  broadcast  television  stations,  that  provide  multiple  channels  of  free  over-the-air programming",

Our most significant agreements for the licensing of film and television entertainment content include exclusive rights with Paramount, Warner Bros. and our Studios segment.\n\n## Other Sources of Supply and Operations\n\nWe purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant amount of customer premise equipment, including wireless gateways and set-top boxes, network equipment, and services to provide our broadband and video services to residential and business customers. We also purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of wireless devices. We use a limited number of vendors to provide customer billing for our residential and business customers.\n\nOur technical services groups perform various tasks, including installations, plant maintenance and upgrades to our domestic network, and servicing and upgrades of customer premise equipment. The service vehicles used by our technical services groups are primarily owned. Our customer service teams provide primarily 24/7 callanswering capability and other services, and also offer our services to residential and business customers.\n\n## Competition\n\n## Residential Connectiv ity &amp; Platforms\n\n## Broadband\n\nWe compete with a number of companies, many with significant financial resources, that offer internet services, including:\n\n- wireline telecommunications companies\n- wireless telecommunications companies\n- municipal broadband networks and power companies\n- satellite broadband providers\n\nCertain  wireline  telecommunications  companies,  such  as AT&amp;T,  Frontier,  Lumen  and  V erizon  in  the  United  States  and  BT  and  V irgin  Media  O2  in  the  United Kingdom,  have  built  and  are  continuing  to  build  fiber-based  wireline  network  infrastructure  further  into  their  networks,  which  enables  them  to  provide  data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with traditional copper digital subscriber line ('DSL') technology, and are offering services with these higher speeds in many of our service areas. Certain companies that offer DSL service have increased data transmission speeds, lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our broadband services.\n\nVarious wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of technologies, including 5G  fixed wireless networks and 4G  and 5G  wireless broadband services. These networks work with devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and mobile and fixed wireless routers, as well as wireless data cards.\n\nOther companies and municipalities have launched fiber-based or newer satellite-based broadband technologies that provide services in certain areas in which we operate.\n\nDomestic broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state levels may result in other service providers deploying subsidized internet access within our footprint. The availability of these and other offerings could negatively impact the demand for our domestic broadband services.\n\n## Wireless\n\nWe compete with national and regional wireless service providers in the United States, including AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and V erizon, and wireless service providers in the United Kingdom that offer wireless service on both a stand-alone basis and with other services as bundled offerings.\n\n## Video\n\nWe compete with a number of companies offering video services in the Connectivity &amp; Platforms markets, including:\n\n- DTC streaming service providers and aggregators, including:\n- subscription-based services, such as Disney+ and Netflix, that offer online services that enable internet streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming\n- virtual multichannel video providers, such as Hulu + Live TV and YouTube TV, that offer streamed linear television networks\n- free ad-supported television services\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How did AT&T's strategic relationship with Time Warner Inc. evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of its ownership stake, operational integration, and eventual divestiture, and what does this multi-year trajectory reveal about AT&T's broader entertainment strategy?",
      "answer": "AT&T's relationship with Time Warner Inc. underwent a significant transformation from 2022 through 2024. In 2022, the company completed the separation of its WarnerMedia business, which had originated from the 2018 acquisition of Time Warner Inc., through a Reverse Morris Trust transaction with Discovery, marking a strategic exit from direct ownership. By 2023, Time Warner Inc. was no longer referenced as an active investment or subsidiary, indicating full operational separation and integration into the new Warner Bros. Discovery entity. In 2024, AT&T finalized its exit from entertainment by agreeing to sell its remaining interest in DIRECTV to TPG, which had been part of the broader post-Time Warner strategic realignment. This 3-year trajectory reveals a consistent strategic pivot away from media and entertainment toward core telecommunications and digital infrastructure.",

        "Hop 1: [T](2023) \u2192 [Time Warner Inc.]: No longer referenced as an owned entity, indicating full separation post-2022 transaction.",

On January 1, 1984, we were spun-off from ATTC pursuant to an anti-trust consent decree, becoming an independent publicly traded telecommunications services provider.\n\nFollowing our formation, we expanded our communications footprint and operations, most significantly:\n\n- Our subsidiaries merged with incumbent local exchange carriers (ILEC) Pacific Telesis Group in 1997 and Ameritech Corporation in 1999.\n- In 2005, we merged one of our subsidiaries with ATTC, creating one of the world's leading telecommunications providers. In connection with the merger, we changed the name of our company from 'SBC Communications Inc.' to 'AT&amp;T Inc.'\n- In 2006, we acquired ILEC BellSouth Corporation (BellSouth), which included BellSouth's 40% economic interest in AT&amp;T Mobility LLC (AT&amp;T Mobility), formerly Cingular Wireless LLC, resulting in 100% ownership of AT&amp;T Mobility.\n- In 2014, we completed the acquisition of wireless provider Leap Wireless International, Inc.\n- In 2015, we acquired wireless properties in Mexico and acquired DIRECTV, a leading provider of digital television entertainment services in both the United States (included in our Video business) and Latin America (referred to as Vrio).\n- From 2018 through April 2022, we acquired and held various investments in entertainment businesses, namely Time Warner Inc., which comprised a substantial portion of our previous WarnerMedia segment.\n- In July 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG Capital (TPG) to form a new company named DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings, LLC (DIRECTV). With the close of the transaction (DIRECTV Transaction), we separated our Video business, comprised of our U.S. video operations, and began accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method. In September 2024, we agreed to sell our remaining interest in DIRECTV to TPG, which we expect to close in mid-2025.\n- In April 2022, we completed the separation of our WarnerMedia business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction). Upon its separation and distribution, the WarnerMedia business met the criteria for discontinued operations, as did other dispositions that were part of a single plan, including Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic Ltd. (Playdemic). These businesses are reflected in our historical financial statements as discontinued operations, including for periods prior to the consummation of the WarnerMedia separation.",

In 2018, the Latin American operations of DIRECTV was renamed Vrio.\n- In June 2018, we acquired Time Warner Inc. (Time Warner), a leader in media and entertainment that operated the Turner, Home Box Office (HBO) and Warner Bros. divisions. We also acquired Otter Media Holdings (substantially disposed of in 2021) and advertising platform AppNexus in August 2018 (agreement to sell signed in December 2021). In May 2021, we entered into an agreement to combine our WarnerMedia segment, subject to certain exceptions, with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc. (Discovery). The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, subject to approval by Discovery shareholders and customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals.\n- In October 2020, we sold our wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n- In July 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG Capital (TPG) to form a new company named DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings, LLC (DIRECTV). With the close of the transaction, we separated our Video business, comprised of our U.S. video operations, and began accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method.",

      "question": "How did T's guarantee obligations to Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about T's long-term liability commitments to its legacy telecom affiliates?",
      "answer": "T maintained consistent guarantee obligations to Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. across all three years, referencing the same Exhibit 4-c to Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2011, in filings for 2022, 2023, and 2024. This indicates that T did not materially alter its liability commitments to Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. despite broader corporate restructuring and evolving executive compensation plans, suggesting long-term strategic continuity in managing legacy telecom obligations.",

      "answer": "T maintained a 41.3% interest in SKY Mexico throughout 2022 and 2023, indicating a strategic holding position in the Latin American pay-TV market. In 2023, SKY Mexico remained part of T's equity method investments, which also included DIRECTV and Gigapower. However, by June 2024, T had fully exited its stake in SKY Mexico, marking a decisive move to divest international assets. This progression\u2014from holding a significant minority stake in 2022 and 2023 to a complete exit in 2024\u2014demonstrates T's deliberate shift away from non-core international operations as part of a broader strategic refocusing.",

The transaction is expected to close in mid-2025, pending customary closing conditions. We expect a gain on sale, whose amount will be dependent on the timing of close.\n\nBeginning in third-quarter 2024, our investment in DIRECTV was reduced to zero on our consolidated balance sheet, resulting from aggregate cash receipts exceeding our initial investment balance plus our cumulative equity in DIRECTV earnings. As we are not committed, implicitly or explicitly, to provide financial or other support to DIRECTV, we record cash distributions received in excess of our share of DIRECTV's earnings in 'Equity in net income of affiliates' in the consolidated statements of income and as cash provided by operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $2,027, $1,666 and $1,808 of equity in net income of affiliates and received total distributions of $2,955, $3,715 and $4,457, respectively, from DIRECTV. The book value of our investment in DIRECTV was $0 and $877 at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nOur share of net income or loss may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest of DIRECTV as the terms of the arrangement prescribe substantive nonproportionate cash distributions, both from operations and in liquidation, that are based on classes of interests held by investors. In the event that DIRECTV records a loss, that loss will be allocated to ownership interests based on their seniority, beginning with the most subordinated interests.\n\nGigapower On May 11, 2023, we closed our transaction with BlackRock, through a fund managed by its Diversified Infrastructure business, related to Gigapower, LLC (Gigapower). We hold a 50% interest in this joint venture, which provides a fiber network in select areas to internet service providers and other businesses across the U.S. We deconsolidated Gigapower's operations and began accounting for it as an equity method investment on May 12, 2023.\n\nSKY Mexico In June 2024, we sold our 41.3% interest in SKY Mexico, a leading pay-TV provider in Mexico.\n\nThe following table presents summarized financial information for DIRECTV and our other equity method investments, consisting primarily of Gigapower, SKY Mexico (prior to disposition) and certain sports-related programming investments, at December 31, or for the year then ended:\n\n",

In the second quarter of 2021, we classified the Vrio disposal group as held-for-sale and reported the disposal group at fair value less cost to sell, which resulted in a noncash, pre-tax impairment charge of $4,555, including approximately $2,100 related to accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments and $2,500 related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Approximately $80 of the impairment was attributable to noncontrolling interest. The assets and liabilities removed from our consolidated balance sheet included $851 of Vrio held-for-sale assets primarily related to deferred customer contract acquisition and fulfillment costs, prepaids and other deferred charges, and $2,872 of related liabilities primarily for reserves associated with accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments, which reversed against accumulated other comprehensive income upon close of the transaction. This disposition did not result in a net material gain or loss. We continue to hold a 41.3% interest in SKY Mexico, a leading pay-TV provider in Mexico.\n\nOtter Media During the third quarter of 2021, we disposed of substantially all of the assets of Otter Media. We received approximately $1,540 in cash and removed approximately $1,200 of goodwill associated with these assets. The dispositions did not result in a material gain or loss.\n\nPlaydemic Ltd. On September 20, 2021, we sold WarnerMedia's mobile games app studio, Playdemic Ltd. (Playdemic) for approximately $1,370 in cash and recognized a pre-tax gain of $706 in 'Other income (expense) - net,' on our consolidated statement of income. Approximately $600 of goodwill was removed related to this business. Playdemic was excluded from the pending WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction.\n\nCentral European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CME) On October 13, 2020, we completed the sale of our 65.3% interest in CME, a European broadcasting company, for approximately $1,100. This disposition did not result in a material gain or loss. Upon close, we received relief from a debt guarantee originally covering approximately $1,100 that was reduced to $600 at the time of the sale.\n\nOperations in Puerto Rico On October 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our previously held-for-sale wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for approximately $1,950 and recorded a pre-tax loss of $82. Upon sale we removed held-for-sale assets ('Prepaid and other current assets') and held-for-sale liabilities ('Accounts payable and accrued liabilities') that primarily consisted of FCC licenses (approximately $1,100), allocated goodwill (approximately $250), net property, plant and equipment (approximately $850) and net tax liabilities (approximately $500), previously reported on our consolidated balance sheets. The proceeds were used to redeem $1,950 of cumulative preferred interests in a subsidiary that held notes secured by the proceeds of this sale.\n\nHudson Yards In June 2019, we sold our ownership in Hudson Yards North Tower Holdings LLC under a sale-leaseback arrangement for cash proceeds of $2,081 and recorded a loss of approximately $100 resulting from transaction costs (primarily real estate transfer taxes).",

      "question": "How did AT&T's specific guarantees related to Pacific Bell Telephone Co. evolve across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings, and what does this multi-year pattern reveal about the company's long-term liability commitments to legacy entities?",
      "answer": "AT&T's guarantees related to Pacific Bell Telephone Co. remained substantively unchanged across the 2022, 2023, and 2024 filings, with identical references to the 2011 Form 10-K exhibits explicitly covering these obligations in all three years. This consistent inclusion of the same dated reference to Pacific Bell Telephone Co. suggests that AT&T maintained its long-standing liability commitments to this legacy entity without modification or termination across the three-year period. The absence of any updates or new disclosures about Pacific Bell Telephone Co. in more recent filings indicates that these guarantees remained static, pointing to a stable but potentially aging liability structure tied to historical corporate relationships.",

      "question": "How did AT&T's strategic relationship with Time Warner Inc. evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of its integration, operational restructuring, and eventual divestiture as part of the broader WarnerMedia segment?",
      "answer": "AT&T's relationship with Time Warner Inc. underwent a significant transformation from 2022 through 2024. In 2022, Time Warner was described as a key acquisition completed in June 2018, forming a substantial part of AT&T's WarnerMedia segment. By 2023, the company had already separated the WarnerMedia business via a Reverse Morris Trust transaction with Discovery, which was completed in April 2022, marking the exit from the entertainment content creation space. In 2024, AT&T finalized the divestiture of its remaining interest in DIRECTV, the last major asset tied to the entertainment strategy initiated with the Time Warner acquisition. This trajectory shows a strategic pivot away from vertically integrated media and entertainment back toward core telecommunications and connectivity services.",

        "Hop 1: [T](2022) \u2192 [Time Warner Inc.]: Acquired in June 2018 and remained a core part of the WarnerMedia segment as of 2022.",

        "Hop 3: [T](2024) \u2192 [Time Warner Inc.]: By 2024, AT&T had agreed to sell its remaining interest in DIRECTV (a legacy asset from the entertainment strategy linked to Time Warner) to TPG, expected to close mid-2025, completing the wind-down of its entertainment investments."

(SBC), was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold AT&amp;T Corp.'s (ATTC) local telephone companies. On January 1, 1984, we were spun-off from ATTC pursuant to an anti-trust consent decree, becoming an independent publicly traded telecommunications services provider. At formation, we primarily operated in five southwestern states.\n\nFollowing our formation, we have expanded our communications footprint and operations and invested in entertainment businesses, most significantly:\n\n- Our subsidiaries merged with Pacific Telesis Group in 1997, Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation in 1998 and Ameritech Corporation in 1999, thereby expanding our wireline operations as the incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) into a total of 13 states.\n- In 2005, we merged one of our subsidiaries with ATTC, creating one of the world's leading telecommunications providers. In connection with the merger, we changed the name of our company from 'SBC Communications Inc.' to 'AT&amp;T Inc.'\n- In 2006, we merged one of our subsidiaries with BellSouth Corporation (BellSouth) making us the ILEC in an additional nine states. With the BellSouth acquisition, we also acquired BellSouth's 40 percent economic interest in AT&amp;T Mobility LLC (AT&amp;T Mobility), formerly Cingular Wireless LLC, resulting in 100 percent ownership of AT&amp;T Mobility.\n- In 2014, we completed the acquisition of wireless provider Leap Wireless International, Inc. and sold our ILEC operations in Connecticut, which we had previously acquired in 1998.\n- In 2015, we acquired wireless properties in Mexico, and acquired DIRECTV, a leading provider of digital television entertainment services in both the United States and Latin America. In 2018, the Latin American operations of DIRECTV was renamed Vrio.\n- In June 2018, we acquired Time Warner Inc. (Time Warner), a leader in media and entertainment that operated the Turner, Home Box Office (HBO) and Warner Bros. divisions. We also acquired Otter Media Holdings (substantially disposed of in 2021) and advertising platform AppNexus in August 2018 (agreement to sell signed in December 2021). In May 2021, we entered into an agreement to combine our WarnerMedia segment, subject to certain exceptions, with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc. (Discovery). The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, subject to approval by Discovery shareholders and customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals.\n- In October 2020, we sold our wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n- In July 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG Capital (TPG) to form a new company named DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings, LLC (DIRECTV). With the close of the transaction, we separated our Video business, comprised of our U.S. video operations, and began accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method.",

Upon its separation and distribution, the WarnerMedia business met the criteria for discontinued operations, as did other dispositions that were part of a single plan, including Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic Ltd. (Playdemic). These businesses are reflected in our historical financial statements as discontinued operations, including for periods prior to the consummation of the WarnerMedia separation.",

      "question": "What does AT&T's continued guarantee of Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.'s obligations in 2022, 2023, and 2024 suggest about its long-term liability management strategy for legacy telecom entities?",
      "answer": "AT&T consistently guaranteed Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.'s obligations across all three years, as evidenced by the repeated inclusion of Exhibit 4-b in its 10-K filings for 2022, 2023, and 2024. This unchanging commitment suggests a deliberate and stable strategy for managing legacy telecom liabilities, with no indication of reduction or restructuring of these obligations over the three-year period. The persistence of this guarantee language across filings indicates that AT&T has maintained full financial responsibility for these legacy entities without altering the terms or scope of its commitments.",

      "answer": "AT&T maintained a 41.3% interest in SKY Mexico in 2022 and accounted for it under the equity method in 2023, but exited the investment completely in mid-2024. This progression reflects a deliberate divestiture strategy targeting non-core international assets. In 2022, AT&T explicitly stated its continued ownership stake in SKY Mexico following the sale of Vrio. By 2023, SKY Mexico was still part of AT&T\u2019s equity method investments alongside DIRECTV and Gigapower. In 2024, AT&T finalized the sale of its 41.3% stake in SKY Mexico, completing its exit from the Mexican pay-TV market. The 3-year evolution shows a phased approach to shedding international media assets, aligning with broader strategic refocusing on core U.S. telecommunications operations.",

          "chunk_text": "\nVrio On November 15, 2021, we completed the sale of our Latin America video operations, Vrio, to Grupo Werthein and recorded a note receivable of $610 to be paid over four years, of which $300 is in the form of seller financing and the remainder is related to working capital adjustments. In the second quarter of 2021, we classified the Vrio disposal group as held-for-sale and reported the disposal group at fair value less cost to sell, which resulted in a noncash, pre-tax impairment charge of $4,555, including approximately $2,100 related to accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments and $2,500 related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Approximately $80 of the impairment was attributable to noncontrolling interest. The assets and liabilities removed from our consolidated balance sheet included $851 of Vrio held-for-sale assets primarily related to deferred customer contract acquisition and fulfillment costs, prepaids and other deferred charges, and $2,872 of related liabilities primarily for reserves associated with accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments, which reversed against accumulated other comprehensive income upon close of the transaction. This disposition did not result in a net material gain or loss. We continue to hold a 41.3% interest in SKY Mexico, a leading pay-TV provider in Mexico.\n\nOtter Media During the third quarter of 2021, we disposed of substantially all of the assets of Otter Media. We received approximately $1,540 in cash and removed approximately $1,200 of goodwill associated with these assets. The dispositions did not result in a material gain or loss.\n\nPlaydemic Ltd. On September 20, 2021, we sold WarnerMedia's mobile games app studio, Playdemic Ltd. (Playdemic) for approximately $1,370 in cash and recognized a pre-tax gain of $706 in 'Other income (expense) - net,' on our consolidated statement of income. Approximately $600 of goodwill was removed related to this business. Playdemic was excluded from the pending WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction.\n\nCentral European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CME) On October 13, 2020, we completed the sale of our 65.3% interest in CME, a European broadcasting company, for approximately $1,100. This disposition did not result in a material gain or loss. Upon close, we received relief from a debt guarantee originally covering approximately $1,100 that was reduced to $600 at the time of the sale.\n\nOperations in Puerto Rico On October 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our previously held-for-sale wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for approximately $1,950 and recorded a pre-tax loss of $82. Upon sale we removed held-for-sale assets ('Prepaid and other current assets') and held-for-sale liabilities ('Accounts payable and accrued liabilities') that primarily consisted of FCC licenses (approximately $1,100), allocated goodwill (approximately $250), net property, plant and equipment (approximately $850) and net tax liabilities (approximately $500), previously reported on our consolidated balance sheets. The proceeds were used to redeem $1,950 of cumulative preferred interests in a subsidiary that held notes secured by the proceeds of this sale.\n\nHudson Yards In June 2019, we sold our ownership in Hudson Yards North Tower Holdings LLC under a sale-leaseback arrangement for cash proceeds of $2,081 and recorded a loss of approximately $100 resulting from transaction costs (primarily real estate transfer taxes).",

We expect a gain on sale, whose amount will be dependent on the timing of close.\n\nBeginning in third-quarter 2024, our investment in DIRECTV was reduced to zero on our consolidated balance sheet, resulting from aggregate cash receipts exceeding our initial investment balance plus our cumulative equity in DIRECTV earnings. As we are not committed, implicitly or explicitly, to provide financial or other support to DIRECTV, we record cash distributions received in excess of our share of DIRECTV's earnings in 'Equity in net income of affiliates' in the consolidated statements of income and as cash provided by operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $2,027, $1,666 and $1,808 of equity in net income of affiliates and received total distributions of $2,955, $3,715 and $4,457, respectively, from DIRECTV. The book value of our investment in DIRECTV was $0 and $877 at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nOur share of net income or loss may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest of DIRECTV as the terms of the arrangement prescribe substantive nonproportionate cash distributions, both from operations and in liquidation, that are based on classes of interests held by investors. In the event that DIRECTV records a loss, that loss will be allocated to ownership interests based on their seniority, beginning with the most subordinated interests.\n\nGigapower On May 11, 2023, we closed our transaction with BlackRock, through a fund managed by its Diversified Infrastructure business, related to Gigapower, LLC (Gigapower). We hold a 50% interest in this joint venture, which provides a fiber network in select areas to internet service providers and other businesses across the U.S. We deconsolidated Gigapower's operations and began accounting for it as an equity method investment on May 12, 2023.\n\nSKY Mexico In June 2024, we sold our 41.3% interest in SKY Mexico, a leading pay-TV provider in Mexico.\n\nThe following table presents summarized financial information for DIRECTV and our other equity method investments, consisting primarily of Gigapower, SKY Mexico (prior to disposition) and certain sports-related programming investments, at December 31, or for the year then ended:\n\n",

At formation, we primarily operated in five southwestern states.\n\nFollowing our formation, we have expanded our communications footprint and operations and invested in entertainment businesses, most significantly:\n\n- Our subsidiaries merged with Pacific Telesis Group in 1997, Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation in 1998 and Ameritech Corporation in 1999, thereby expanding our wireline operations as the incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) into a total of 13 states.\n- In 2005, we merged one of our subsidiaries with ATTC, creating one of the world's leading telecommunications providers. In connection with the merger, we changed the name of our company from 'SBC Communications Inc.' to 'AT&amp;T Inc.'\n- In 2006, we merged one of our subsidiaries with BellSouth Corporation (BellSouth) making us the ILEC in an additional nine states. With the BellSouth acquisition, we also acquired BellSouth's 40 percent economic interest in AT&amp;T Mobility LLC (AT&amp;T Mobility), formerly Cingular Wireless LLC, resulting in 100 percent ownership of AT&amp;T Mobility.\n- In 2014, we completed the acquisition of wireless provider Leap Wireless International, Inc. and sold our ILEC operations in Connecticut, which we had previously acquired in 1998.\n- In 2015, we acquired wireless properties in Mexico, and acquired DIRECTV, a leading provider of digital television entertainment services in both the United States and Latin America. In 2018, the Latin American operations of DIRECTV was renamed Vrio.\n- In June 2018, we acquired Time Warner Inc. (Time Warner), a leader in media and entertainment that operated the Turner, Home Box Office (HBO) and Warner Bros. divisions. We also acquired Otter Media Holdings (substantially disposed of in 2021) and advertising platform AppNexus in August 2018 (agreement to sell signed in December 2021). In May 2021, we entered into an agreement to combine our WarnerMedia segment, subject to certain exceptions, with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc. (Discovery). The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, subject to approval by Discovery shareholders and customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals.\n- In October 2020, we sold our wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n- In July 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG Capital (TPG) to form a new company named DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings, LLC (DIRECTV). With the close of the transaction, we separated our Video business, comprised of our U.S. video operations, and began accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method.",

With the close of the transaction (DIRECTV Transaction), we separated our Video business, comprised of our U.S. video operations, and began accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method. In September 2024, we agreed to sell our remaining interest in DIRECTV to TPG, which we expect to close in mid-2025.\n- In April 2022, we completed the separation of our WarnerMedia business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction). Upon its separation and distribution, the WarnerMedia business met the criteria for discontinued operations, as did other dispositions that were part of a single plan, including Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic Ltd. (Playdemic). These businesses are reflected in our historical financial statements as discontinued operations, including for periods prior to the consummation of the WarnerMedia separation.",

      "question": "How did T's strategic positioning in SKY Mexico evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of its ownership stake, equity method accounting treatment, and eventual exit, and what does this 3-year trajectory reveal about T's broader divestiture strategy in the Latin American pay-TV market?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, T maintained a 41.3% interest in SKY Mexico, a leading pay-TV provider in Mexico, but ultimately exited the investment in June 2024. In 2022, T continued to hold this stake without any significant changes noted. By 2023, SKY Mexico was listed among T\u2019s key equity method investments, alongside DIRECTV and Gigapower, indicating that T was still actively accounting for its stake under the equity method. In 2024, T completed the sale of its 41.3% interest in SKY Mexico, marking the conclusion of its involvement in the Latin American pay-TV market. This 3-year trajectory\u2014from holding steady, to continued equity method treatment, to full divestiture\u2014reflects a deliberate strategic shift by T to exit non-core international assets and focus on its core domestic operations.",

          "chunk_text": "\nVrio On November 15, 2021, we completed the sale of our Latin America video operations, Vrio, to Grupo Werthein and recorded a note receivable of $610 to be paid over four years, of which $300 is in the form of seller financing and the remainder is related to working capital adjustments. In the second quarter of 2021, we classified the Vrio disposal group as held-for-sale and reported the disposal group at fair value less cost to sell, which resulted in a noncash, pre-tax impairment charge of $4,555, including approximately $2,100 related to accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments and $2,500 related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Approximately $80 of the impairment was attributable to noncontrolling interest. The assets and liabilities removed from our consolidated balance sheet included $851 of Vrio held-for-sale assets primarily related to deferred customer contract acquisition and fulfillment costs, prepaids and other deferred charges, and $2,872 of related liabilities primarily for reserves associated with accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments, which reversed against accumulated other comprehensive income upon close of the transaction. This disposition did not result in a net material gain or loss. We continue to hold a 41.3% interest in SKY Mexico, a leading pay-TV provider in Mexico.\n\nOtter Media During the third quarter of 2021, we disposed of substantially all of the assets of Otter Media. We received approximately $1,540 in cash and removed approximately $1,200 of goodwill associated with these assets. The dispositions did not result in a material gain or loss.\n\nPlaydemic Ltd. On September 20, 2021, we sold WarnerMedia's mobile games app studio, Playdemic Ltd. (Playdemic) for approximately $1,370 in cash and recognized a pre-tax gain of $706 in 'Other income (expense) - net,' on our consolidated statement of income. Approximately $600 of goodwill was removed related to this business. Playdemic was excluded from the pending WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction.\n\nCentral European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CME) On October 13, 2020, we completed the sale of our 65.3% interest in CME, a European broadcasting company, for approximately $1,100. This disposition did not result in a material gain or loss. Upon close, we received relief from a debt guarantee originally covering approximately $1,100 that was reduced to $600 at the time of the sale.\n\nOperations in Puerto Rico On October 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our previously held-for-sale wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for approximately $1,950 and recorded a pre-tax loss of $82. Upon sale we removed held-for-sale assets ('Prepaid and other current assets') and held-for-sale liabilities ('Accounts payable and accrued liabilities') that primarily consisted of FCC licenses (approximately $1,100), allocated goodwill (approximately $250), net property, plant and equipment (approximately $850) and net tax liabilities (approximately $500), previously reported on our consolidated balance sheets. The proceeds were used to redeem $1,950 of cumulative preferred interests in a subsidiary that held notes secured by the proceeds of this sale.\n\nHudson Yards In June 2019, we sold our ownership in Hudson Yards North Tower Holdings LLC under a sale-leaseback arrangement for cash proceeds of $2,081 and recorded a loss of approximately $100 resulting from transaction costs (primarily real estate transfer taxes).",

The transaction is expected to close in mid-2025, pending customary closing conditions. We expect a gain on sale, whose amount will be dependent on the timing of close.\n\nBeginning in third-quarter 2024, our investment in DIRECTV was reduced to zero on our consolidated balance sheet, resulting from aggregate cash receipts exceeding our initial investment balance plus our cumulative equity in DIRECTV earnings. As we are not committed, implicitly or explicitly, to provide financial or other support to DIRECTV, we record cash distributions received in excess of our share of DIRECTV's earnings in 'Equity in net income of affiliates' in the consolidated statements of income and as cash provided by operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $2,027, $1,666 and $1,808 of equity in net income of affiliates and received total distributions of $2,955, $3,715 and $4,457, respectively, from DIRECTV. The book value of our investment in DIRECTV was $0 and $877 at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nOur share of net income or loss may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest of DIRECTV as the terms of the arrangement prescribe substantive nonproportionate cash distributions, both from operations and in liquidation, that are based on classes of interests held by investors. In the event that DIRECTV records a loss, that loss will be allocated to ownership interests based on their seniority, beginning with the most subordinated interests.\n\nGigapower On May 11, 2023, we closed our transaction with BlackRock, through a fund managed by its Diversified Infrastructure business, related to Gigapower, LLC (Gigapower). We hold a 50% interest in this joint venture, which provides a fiber network in select areas to internet service providers and other businesses across the U.S. We deconsolidated Gigapower's operations and began accounting for it as an equity method investment on May 12, 2023.\n\nSKY Mexico In June 2024, we sold our 41.3% interest in SKY Mexico, a leading pay-TV provider in Mexico.\n\nThe following table presents summarized financial information for DIRECTV and our other equity method investments, consisting primarily of Gigapower, SKY Mexico (prior to disposition) and certain sports-related programming investments, at December 31, or for the year then ended:\n\n",

      "question": "How did Google's monetization strategy through Google Ad Manager evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of how it measured performance on Network properties and recognized advertising revenues?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Google's monetization strategy through Google Ad Manager remained central to its advertising business, but the way it measured and recognized performance evolved. In 2022, Google tracked monetization on Google Network properties using impressions and cost-per-impression metrics, recognizing revenue based on both impressions and clicks. By 2023, Google was reporting advertising revenues from Google Ad Manager on a gross basis, meaning the full amount billed to customers was recorded as revenue, with partner payments classified as cost of revenue. In 2024, this gross revenue recognition approach remained consistent, and Google continued to rely on Google Ad Manager as a core platform for monetizing Network properties, further emphasizing its role in customer workflows through integration with Google Ads and Google Marketing Platform. This shows a consistent strategic reliance on Google Ad Manager, with a maturing financial reporting framework that clarified revenue and cost separation.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\n\nWe generate revenues by deliv ering relev ant, cost-effectiv e online adv ertising; cloud-based solutions that prov ide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform serv ices, and applications; sales of other products and serv ices, such as fees receiv ed for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and dev ices.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the v ariable interest and v oting models. Intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported  and  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  notes. Actual  results  could  differ  materially  from  these  estimates  due  to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we ev aluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair v alues of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inv entory; and useful liv es of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believ ed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying v alues of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or serv ices is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or serv ices is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from rev enues.\n\n## Advertising Revenues\n\nWe generate advertising rev enues primarily by deliv ering adv ertising on:\n\n- Google  Search  and  other  properties,  including  rev enues  from  traffic  generated  by  search  distribution  partners  who  use  Google.com  as  their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube properties; and\n- Google Network properties, including rev enues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\n\nOur  customers  generally  purchase  adv ertising  inv entory  through  Google Ads,  Google Ad  Manager,  Google  Display  &amp;  Video  360,  and  Google Marketing Platform, among others.\n\nWe offer adv ertising by deliv ering both performance and brand adv ertising. We recognize rev enues for performance adv ertising when a user engages with the adv ertisement. For brand adv ertising, we recognize rev enues when the ad is displayed, or a user v iews the ad.\n\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we ev aluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report rev enues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report rev enues on a net basis). Generally, we report adv ertising rev enues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as rev enues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of rev enues. Where we are the principal,  we  control  the  adv ertising  inv entory  before  it  is  transferred  to  our  customers.  Our  control  is  ev idenced  by  our  sole  ability  to  monetize  the advertising inv entory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and hav ing a lev el of discretion in establishing pricing.\n\n## Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\n\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and dev ices rev enues consist of rev enues from:",

Cost-perclick is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\n\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by  our  total  number  of  impressions,  and  represents  the  average  amount  we  charge  advertisers  for  each  impression displayed to users.\n\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting  the  number  of  paid  clicks  and  the  number  of  impressions,  and  for  identifying  the  revenues  generated  by  the corresponding click and impression activity.\n\nOur advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &amp; other properties  and  the  change  in  impressions  and  cost-per-impression  on  Google  Network  properties  and  the  correlation between these items, have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including:\n\n- advertiser competition for keywords;\n- changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\n- changes in device mix;\n- changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n- fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;\n- general economic conditions, including the effect of COVID-19;\n- seasonality; and\n- traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels.\n\n## Google Other\n\nGoogle other revenues are comprised of the following:\n\n- Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store;\n- Devices and Services, which includes sales of hardware, including Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel phones;\n- YouTube non-advertising, which includes YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions; and\n- other products and services.\n\n## Google Cloud\n\nGoogle Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:\n\n- Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;\n- Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar and Meet; and\n- other enterprise services.\n\n## Other Bets\n\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.",

By 2023, Pixel devices were explicitly categorized under a distinct 'devices' segment within Google's Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices revenue stream, indicating their growing importance as a standalone revenue contributor. In 2024, the continued inclusion of Pixel devices in the same segment, alongside more detailed revenue recognition policies for digital services and cloud offerings, suggests that Pixel devices were not only maintained as a core product line but also likely integrated with broader AI and cloud capabilities. This 3-year progression reflects a transformation from a hardware investment focus to a mature, strategically embedded product line within Google's ecosystem.",

We report rev enues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app dev elopers and end users for which we earn a serv ice fee.\n\n## Google Cloud Revenues\n\nGoogle Cloud rev enues consist of rev enues from:\n\n- Google  Cloud  Platform,  which  generates  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  for  infrastructure,  platform,  and  other  serv ices.  T hese serv ices  prov ide  access  to  solutions  such  as AI  offerings  including  our AI  infrastructure,  Vertex AI  platform,  and  Gemini  for  Google  Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n- Google  Workspace, which includes subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as  Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Driv e, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\n- other enterprise serv ices.\n\nOur cloud serv ices are generally prov ided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may hav e contract terms longer than a year. Rev enues related to cloud serv ices prov ided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer utilizes the serv ices, based on the quantity of serv ices consumed. Revenues related to cloud serv ices prov ided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably ov er the contract term as the customer receiv es and consumes the benefits of the cloud serv ices.\n\n## Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate rev enues to each performance obligation based on its relativ e standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\n\n## Customer Incentives and Credits\n\nCertain customers receiv e cash-based incentiv es or credits, which are accounted for as v ariable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce rev enues. We believ e that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration related to customer incentiv es and credits.\n\n## Sales Commissions\n\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of rev enues consists of TAC and other costs of rev enues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make av ailable our search access points and serv ices. Our distribution partners include browser prov iders, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software dev elopers; and\n- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of rev enues includes:\n- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  prov iders  from  whom  we  license  v ideo  and  other  content  for  distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content prov iders based on rev enues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;",

We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people's lives easier by combining the best of our AI, software and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products such as Pixel 5a 5G and Pixel 6 phones, the Fitbit Charge 5, Chromecast with Google TV, and the new Google Nest Cams and Nest Doorbell. Creating products that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long run.\n\nThe key to building helpful products for users is our commitment to privacy, security, and user choice. We protect user privacy and security with products that are secure by default and private by design, and that keep users in control of their data.  Our  privacy-preserving  technologies  safeguard  individual  privacy  and  enhance  data  protection.  As  the  Internet evolves, so does our approach to privacy and security. We continue to enhance our anti-malware features in Chrome and drive improvements such as auto-delete controls that automatically delete web and app searches after 18 months. And we continue to keep users and their passwords safe through advances like our built-in password manager.\n\n## How we make money\n\nWe have built  world-class  advertising  technologies  for  advertisers,  agencies,  and  publishers  to  power  their  digital marketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies.\n\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on Google Search &amp; other properties, YouTube and Google Network partners' properties (\"Google Network properties\"). We continue  to  invest  in  both  performance  and  brand  advertising  and  seek  to  improve  the  measurability  of  advertising  so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n\n- Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on, leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n- Brand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services, through videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.\n\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering out invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\n\nWe continue to look to the future and are making long-term investments that we expect to grow revenues beyond advertising, including revenues from Google Play, hardware, and YouTube non-advertising.\n\n- Google Play generates revenues from sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store.\n- Hardware generates revenues from sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, Pixel phones, and other devices.\n- YouTube non-advertising generates revenues from YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions and other services.\n\n## Google Cloud\n\nGoogle  was  a  company  built  in  the  cloud.  We  continue  to  invest  in  infrastructure,  security,  data  management, analytics,  and  AI.  We  see  significant  opportunity  in  helping  businesses  utilize  these  strengths  with  features  like  data migration,  modern  development  environments,  and  machine  learning  tools  to  provide  enterprise-ready  cloud  services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. Google Cloud Platform enables developers to build, test, and deploy  applications  on  its  highly  scalable  and  reliable  infrastructure.  Google  Workspace  collaboration  tools  -  which include apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet and more - are designed with real-time collaboration and machine intelligence  to  help  people  work  smarter.  Because  more  and  more  of  today's  digital  experiences  are  being  built  in  the cloud, Google Cloud products help businesses of all sizes take advantage of the latest technology advances to operate more efficiently.\n\n- Google Cloud Platform generates revenues from infrastructure, platform and other services.",

By 2023, Google adjusted the estimated useful life of servers from four to six years and certain network equipment from five to six years, reducing depreciation expense by $3.9 billion and increasing net income by $3.0 billion for the year \u2014 a change that directly affected infrastructure-heavy operations like Ad Manager. In 2024, Google continued to report advertising revenues from Google Network properties on a gross basis, reinforcing the strategic importance of Google Ad Manager in revenue generation.

Cost-perclick is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\n\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\n\nWe generate revenues by deliv ering relev ant, cost-effectiv e online adv ertising; cloud-based solutions that prov ide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform serv ices, and applications; sales of other products and serv ices, such as fees receiv ed for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and dev ices.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the v ariable interest and v oting models. Intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported  and  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  notes. Actual  results  could  differ  materially  from  these  estimates  due  to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we ev aluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair v alues of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inv entory; and useful liv es of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believ ed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying v alues of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or serv ices is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or serv ices is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from rev enues.\n\n## Advertising Revenues\n\nWe generate advertising rev enues primarily by deliv ering adv ertising on:\n\n- Google  Search  and  other  properties,  including  rev enues  from  traffic  generated  by  search  distribution  partners  who  use  Google.com  as  their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube properties; and\n- Google Network properties, including rev enues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\n\nOur  customers  generally  purchase  adv ertising  inv entory  through  Google Ads,  Google Ad  Manager,  Google  Display  &amp;  Video  360,  and  Google Marketing Platform, among others.\n\nWe offer adv ertising by deliv ering both performance and brand adv ertising. We recognize rev enues for performance adv ertising when a user engages with the adv ertisement. For brand adv ertising, we recognize rev enues when the ad is displayed, or a user v iews the ad.\n\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we ev aluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report rev enues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report rev enues on a net basis). Generally, we report adv ertising rev enues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as rev enues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of rev enues. Where we are the principal,  we  control  the  adv ertising  inv entory  before  it  is  transferred  to  our  customers.  Our  control  is  ev idenced  by  our  sole  ability  to  monetize  the advertising inv entory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and hav ing a lev el of discretion in establishing pricing.\n\n## Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\n\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and dev ices rev enues consist of rev enues from:",

      "answer": "In 2022, Google explicitly stated it was making long-term investments in hardware, specifically mentioning the Pixel 5a 5G and Pixel 6 phones as part of a strategy to build helpful, secure devices that combine AI, software, and hardware. By 2023, the Pixel family of devices was categorized under 'devices' as a distinct revenue stream, indicating that the product line had moved beyond just investment into contributing measurable financial performance. In 2024, the Pixel family was again listed as a core component of the 'devices' revenue category, and its inclusion in a more mature, structured revenue breakdown suggests that it had become a stable and strategic part of Google's hardware portfolio. This progression indicates that Google transitioned the Pixel line from a long-term investment focus to a revenue-generating product category, signaling increased confidence in its position within the competitive hardware market.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nwell as growing our family of hardware devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people's lives easier by combining the best of our AI, software and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products such as Pixel 5a 5G and Pixel 6 phones, the Fitbit Charge 5, Chromecast with Google TV, and the new Google Nest Cams and Nest Doorbell. Creating products that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long run.\n\nThe key to building helpful products for users is our commitment to privacy, security, and user choice. We protect user privacy and security with products that are secure by default and private by design, and that keep users in control of their data.  Our  privacy-preserving  technologies  safeguard  individual  privacy  and  enhance  data  protection.  As  the  Internet evolves, so does our approach to privacy and security. We continue to enhance our anti-malware features in Chrome and drive improvements such as auto-delete controls that automatically delete web and app searches after 18 months. And we continue to keep users and their passwords safe through advances like our built-in password manager.\n\n## How we make money\n\nWe have built  world-class  advertising  technologies  for  advertisers,  agencies,  and  publishers  to  power  their  digital marketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies.\n\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on Google Search &amp; other properties, YouTube and Google Network partners' properties (\"Google Network properties\"). We continue  to  invest  in  both  performance  and  brand  advertising  and  seek  to  improve  the  measurability  of  advertising  so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n\n- Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on, leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n- Brand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services, through videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.\n\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering out invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\n\nWe continue to look to the future and are making long-term investments that we expect to grow revenues beyond advertising, including revenues from Google Play, hardware, and YouTube non-advertising.\n\n- Google Play generates revenues from sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store.\n- Hardware generates revenues from sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, Pixel phones, and other devices.\n- YouTube non-advertising generates revenues from YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions and other services.\n\n## Google Cloud\n\nGoogle  was  a  company  built  in  the  cloud.  We  continue  to  invest  in  infrastructure,  security,  data  management, analytics,  and  AI.  We  see  significant  opportunity  in  helping  businesses  utilize  these  strengths  with  features  like  data migration,  modern  development  environments,  and  machine  learning  tools  to  provide  enterprise-ready  cloud  services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. Google Cloud Platform enables developers to build, test, and deploy  applications  on  its  highly  scalable  and  reliable  infrastructure.  Google  Workspace  collaboration  tools  -  which include apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet and more - are designed with real-time collaboration and machine intelligence  to  help  people  work  smarter.  Because  more  and  more  of  today's  digital  experiences  are  being  built  in  the cloud, Google Cloud products help businesses of all sizes take advantage of the latest technology advances to operate more efficiently.\n\n- Google Cloud Platform generates revenues from infrastructure, platform and other services.",

For example:\n\n- We rely  on  statutory  safe  harbors,  as  set  forth  in  the  Digital  Millennium  Copyright Act  and  Section  230  of  the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, against liability for various linking, caching, and hosting activities. Any legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us. There are legislative proposals in both the U.S. and EU that could reduce our safe harbor protection.\n- Court decisions such as the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on May 13, 2014 on the 'right to be forgotten,' which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results about them in certain instances, may limit the content we can show to our users and impose significant operational burdens.\n\nThe  introduction  of  new  businesses,  products,  services,  and  technologies,  our  activities  in  certain  jurisdictions,  or other  actions  we  take  have  subjected  us,  and  will  likely  continue  to  subject  us,  to  additional  laws  and  regulations.  Our investment  in  a  variety  of  new  fields,  such  as  healthcare  and  payment  services,  has  expanded,  and  will  continue  to expand, the scope of regulations that apply to our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high  and  are  likely  to  increase  in  the  future. Any  failure  on  our  part  to  comply  with  laws  and  regulations  can  result  in negative  publicity  and  diversion  of  management  time  and  effort  and  may  subject  us  to  significant  liabilities  and  other penalties.\n\n## We are subject to claims, suits, government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees that may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  claims,  suits,  government  investigations,  other  proceedings,  and  consent  decrees  involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Due to our manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of products and services, including hardware as well as Google Cloud offerings, we also are subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation. We may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, or service disruptions or failures.\n\nAny  of  these  types  of  legal  proceedings  can  have  an  adverse  effect  on  us  because  of  legal  costs,  diversion  of management resources, negative publicity and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n## We may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content.\n\nOur products and services let users exchange information, advertise products and services, conduct business, and engage in various online activities. We also place advertisements displayed on other companies' websites, and we offer third-party products, services, and/or content. The law relating to the liability of online service providers for others' activities on their services is still somewhat unsettled around the world. Claims have been brought against us, and we",

In response, we hav e implemented robust programs, adopted reporting frameworks and principles, and announced a number of complex and ambitious goals and initiativ es that may require considerable inv estments. We cannot guarantee that our goals and initiativ es will be fully realized on the timelines we expect or at all, and projects that are completed as planned may not achiev e the results we anticipate.\n\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, enforcement actions, consent  orders,  and  other  forms  of  regulatory  s crutiny  and  legal  liability,  including  competition  matters ,  that  could  harm  our  bus ines s , reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and gov ernment inquiries and inv estigations, other proceedings, and orders inv olv ing competition, intellectual  property,  data  priv acy  and  security,  tax  and  related  compliance,  labor  and  employment,  commercial  disputes,  content  generated  by  our users, goods and serv ices offered by adv ertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), v arious U.S. states, and other plaintiffs hav e filed, and may continue to file in the future, sev eral antitrust lawsuits about v arious aspects of our business, including our adv ertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the operation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store.\n\nFor example, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit alleging that Google v iolated antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising, and in August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google v iolated such antitrust laws. T he Court is holding  a  separate  proceeding  to  determine  remedies,  which  could  include  alterations  to  our  products  and  serv ices  and  our  business  models  and operations,  including  structural  remedies,  and/or  our  distribution  arrangements,  among  other  changes.  While  we  plan  to  appeal,  there  can  be  no assurance that our appeal will succeed, or that we will be able to change or decrease the sev erity of any remedies that may be ordered, and any or all of these potential remedies could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nAlso, in December 2023, a California jury deliv ered a v erdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google v iolated antitrust laws relating to Google Play's  business.  T he  presiding  judge  issued  a  remedies  decision  in  October  2024  that  ordered  a  v ariety  of  alterations  to  our  business  models  and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing the v erdict, but if we are unsuccessful, we could face significant expenses to implement the remedies, and such costs and alterations could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nFurthermore, in December 2020, sev eral State Attorneys General, led by the T exas Attorney General, filed an antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of T exas alleging that Google v iolated antitrust and other laws relating to its adv ertising technology. T his case is set for trial in  March 2025, and we could face significant civ il penalties. In January 2023, the DOJ and sev eral Attorneys General sued in the Eastern District of Virginia  alleging  similar  antitrust  v iolations  relating  to  Google's  adv ertising  technology.  T rial  in  the  DOJ  matter  concluded  in  September  2024  with  a decision  expected  in  early  2025.  If  we  are  unsuccessful,  we  could  face  an  order  on  remedies  that  could  harm  our  business,  reputation,  financial condition, and operating results.\n\nIn addition to these regulatory proceedings, priv ate indiv idual and collectiv e actions that ov erlap with claims pursued by regulators are pending in the U.S. and in sev eral other jurisdictions. Adv erse results in these or similar future lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages and remedies that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nOther regulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies, and data protection authorities, hav e challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. We are cooperating with these inv estigations and defending litigation or appealing decisions where appropriate.\n\nWe are also subject to a v ariety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation, and we may also be subject to claims inv olv ing health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other env ironmental effects, AI training, dev elopment, and commercialization, or serv ice disruptions or failures.
