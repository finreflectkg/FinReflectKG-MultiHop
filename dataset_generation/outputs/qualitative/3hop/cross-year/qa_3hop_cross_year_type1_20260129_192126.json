      "answer": "In 2023, PEP's international plan assets included $30 million allocated to contracts with insurance companies, which slightly decreased to $29 million in 2024. This small decline indicates a relatively stable but slightly reduced emphasis on this investment category within the broader international plan assets portfolio over the two-year period.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ generated $861 million in revenue from the Gum & Candy category in the AMEA region, which accounted for 2.8% of AMEA's total net revenues. This dependency on Gum & Candy in AMEA suggests that the category played a meaningful role in the region's revenue mix. By 2023, MDLZ's total assets in the AMEA region stood at $9,965 million, a slight increase from $9,882 million in 2022. This indicates that MDLZ maintained or slightly expanded its asset base in AMEA despite the relatively modest contribution from the Gum & Candy segment, suggesting a strategic decision to sustain or grow presence in the region despite the category's limited revenue share.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ reported a fair value of $71 million for net investment hedge contracts under Level 2 financial liabilities. In 2024, while the exact dollar value is not provided, the continued classification of net investment hedge contracts under Level 2 financial liabilities indicates that the company maintained a similar valuation methodology using observable market inputs. The persistence of Level 2 classification suggests that MDLZ's hedging strategy remained consistent, relying on over-the-counter derivatives valued using income-based approaches tied to observable market data. This consistency in methodology implies that the company's approach to managing foreign exchange risk through net investment hedges did not fundamentally change between reporting periods.",

The fair value of these instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges.\n\nLevel 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of over-the-counter ('OTC') currency exchange forwards, options and swaps; commodity forwards and options; net investment hedge contracts; and interest rate swaps. Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our bifurcated exchange options are valued, as derivative instrument liabilities, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related to the market price of the underlying note and associated credit spread combined with the share of price, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility of the JDE Peet's shares over the life of the option. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our derivative contracts do not have a legal right of set-off. We manage the credit risk in connection with these and all our derivatives by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.",

      "answer": "In 2023, PEP's U.S. Plan Assets included $1,812 million in Government Securities, which decreased to $1,538 million in 2024. This represents a reduction of $274 million, or about 15.1%. The decline in allocation to Government Securities, coupled with an increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents from $349 million to $732 million (an increase of $383 million or 109.7%), suggests a strategic shift toward more liquid assets in 2024. This evolution indicates a potential rebalancing of the portfolio to prioritize liquidity and possibly reduce exposure to fixed-income instruments.",

        "Hop 1: PEP(2023) \u2192 U.S. Plan Assets: PEP disclosed $11,724 million in U.S. Plan Assets in 2023, including a $150 million discretionary contribution made in January 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2023, PM finalized the acquisition of Swedish Match, paying a final redemption price of SEK 115.07 per share, completing the process in Q4 2023 after the arbitral tribunal decision in September. This acquisition gave PM full control over Swedish Match, a leader in oral nicotine delivery, particularly in the U.S. market. By 2024, this integration had accelerated PM's transformation into a smoke-free company, strengthening its global smoke-free portfolio with leadership in both heat-not-burn and oral nicotine categories. The acquisition directly enabled PM to leverage Swedish Match's market-leading oral nicotine capabilities, aligning with its broader strategic shift toward non-combustible nicotine products.",

      "answer": "In 2023, MO formed Horizon, a joint venture with JTIUH, to commercialize heated tobacco stick (HTS) products in the U.S., which was explicitly stated to depend on receiving regulatory authorizations. By 2024, MO disclosed that delays in obtaining FDA PMTAs (Pre-Market Tobacco Applications) could significantly hinder Horizon's revenue potential and broader innovation strategy. This concern was financially grounded in a hypothetical impairment analysis showing that a 1% increase in the discount rate\u2014linked to regulatory uncertainty\u2014could result in a $125 million impairment charge on the e-vapor reporting unit. Thus, the 2023 formation of Horizon and its regulatory dependency directly shaped 2024 risk disclosures around regulatory timelines and their financial consequences.",

If the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative does not reject the ITC's decision, the restrictions will take effect on March 31, 2025 or earlier if the Trade Representative notifies the ITC of approval before the 60 days elapse.\n\nThe success of Horizon, our joint venture with JTIUH for the marketing and commercialization of HTS products in the United States, in generating new revenue streams by commercializing current and future HTS products owned by us or Japan Tobacco is dependent upon a number of factors. These factors include (i) receipt of regulatory authorizations, (ii) prevailing economic, market, regulatory or business conditions, or changes in such conditions, negatively affecting the parties or their plans for future collaboration and partnerships, (iii) changes in market or other conditions resulting in unanticipated delays in the design and development of future products or the commencement of test launches, (iv) the outcome of any legal proceedings or investigations that may be instituted against the parties or others related to the joint venture, (v) changes in the preferences of U.S. adult tobacco consumers, (vi) the failure to meet commercialization milestones and (vii) the ability of the parties to enter into future partnerships on terms acceptable to both parties and in the ex pected manner or timeframe, if at all. Such factors could have a negative effect on our ability to generate new revenue streams and enter new geographic markets.\n\nLengthy and unpredictable regulatory review periods complicate efforts to strategize and plan with respect to commercialization of new products, and we cannot predict or influence the speed with which the FDA reviews PMTAs. For example, a protracted FDA review of one of our operating companies' PMTAs would allow competitive products already on the market to establish market share, brand recognition and adult tobacco consumer loyalty in the absence of competition from our product. If we do not succeed in commercializing innovative tobacco products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers or we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory authorization for the marketing or sale of these products, including with claims of reduced health risks, we could be at a competitive disadvantage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nOur inability to successfully counter the effects of illicit trade in tobacco products, including e-v apor products, could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achiev e our Vision.\n\nIllicit trade in tobacco products has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, including the sales volumes and market shares of our operating companies' innovative and smoke-free products and traditional tobacco products. Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products that do not comply with the FSPTCA and FDA regulations; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untax ed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and the diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another jurisdiction. Counterfeit versions of our operating companies' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands as well as other stakeholders' perceptions and opinions of our companies and brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment we have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes, imposing legislative or regulatory requirements, or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are legally distributed and sold, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\nIn the e-vapor category, illicit flavored disposable product usage has significantly increased, and such products now comprise the majority of the e-vapor category. The impacts of this dynamic include declines in pod-based e-vapor product volume and increased cross-category movement among adult cigarette smokers that has contributed to higher than expected domestic cigarette industry volume declines. Recent enforcement actions by regulatory agencies have not had a material impact in curbing the proliferation and sale of illicit disposable e-vapor products. This dynamic has made the operating environment challenging for our businesses. We have increased engagement with the FDA and other government agencies to encourage enforcement action against these illicit products, but such enforcement has been inadequate to date. We also have taken legal action to protect our lawful e-vapor business, which exposes us to additional costs and expenses. Our failure to counter the impacts of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products and the FDA's failure to take meaningful enforcement actions against manufacturers and products that violate the law could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nFailure to complete or manage strategic transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and investments in third parties, or realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nWe regularly evaluate potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and investments in third parties. Opportunities for strategic transactions may be limited, and the success of any such transaction is dependent upon our ability to complete and realize the expected benefits of the transaction in the expected time frame or at all. Following the completion of a transaction there may be certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent and operational risks, including diversion of management's attention from existing core businesses, difficulties integrating other businesses into existing operations and other challenges presented by a transaction",

Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

By 2024, the fair value of these Net Investment Hedge Contracts was reported at $(219) million as of December 31, 2023, indicating a significant liability position.

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ's Level 2 financial liabilities included Net Investment Hedge Contracts as part of a broader category that also contained OTC currency exchange contracts, commodity forwards, and interest rate swaps, all valued using observable market inputs. By 2023, the fair value of Net Investment Hedge Contracts had reached -$219 million, entirely categorized under Level 2 inputs, indicating a significant liability in this category. This evolution shows that while Net Investment Hedge Contracts remained a Level 2 instrument, their growing negative fair value position in 2023 suggests a strategic shift or market-driven change in how MDLZ was managing its foreign exchange exposure on international investments. The absence of Level 3 inputs in both years confirms continued reliance on observable market data for valuation.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PM faced IQOS device supply constraints due to the global semiconductor shortage, limiting IQOS user growth and delaying the return to an unconstrained growth trajectory. Additionally, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) imposed an importation ban on IQOS Platform 1 products effective November 29, 2021, which led to PM USA removing IQOS products from the U.S. market. This significantly disrupted PM's strategy for IQOS in the U.S., despite ongoing appeals and contingency plans for domestic production. By 2024, PM's legal exposure through its stake in PM USA had expanded in Canada, where it was named in multiple class action and health care cost recovery lawsuits. These included claims related to chronic respiratory diseases and addiction, with governments seeking health care cost recovery from tobacco manufacturers. PM USA was specifically listed as an indemnitee in at least seven of these cases, indicating continued legal risk tied to its market presence and product offerings.",

In  the  fourth quarter of 2021, the IQOS device supply situation eased, resulting in an improved IQOS user growth versus the third quarter. We expect an improving IQOS device supply situation, with a gradual return to an unconstrained IQOS user quarterly growth progression. However, we still do not have full visibility over the full year 2022.\n\n## IQOS in the United States\n\nOn November 29, 2021, an importation ban and cease-and-desist orders imposed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") relating  to IQOS Platform  1  products  (including  consumables  and  infringing  components)  went  into  effect.  As  a  result, IQOS is  not currently available for sale in the U.S. We have appealed the patent and statutory issues related to the ITC's Final Determination, and also have contingency plans underway, including domestic production. We hope to be able to resume U.S. supply in the first half of 2023. For more details on the ITC case and related legal matters, please refer to Item 8, Note 17 . Contingencies .\n\nThe ITC decision has no bearing outside the U.S.; competitor lawsuits based on the same patent families have repeatedly and universally failed in European courts and the European Patent Office.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nDuring 2021, PMI acquired the following companies:\n\n- Vectura Group plc, an inhaled therapeutics company based in the United Kingdom;\n- Fertin  Pharma A/S,  a  Danish  company  that  is  a  leading  developer  and  manufacturer  of  innovative  pharmaceutical  and  well-being products based on oral and intra-oral delivery systems;\n- OtiTopic,  Inc.,  a  U.S.  respiratory  drug  development  company  with  a  late-stage  dry  powder  inhalation  aspirin  treatment  for  acute myocardial infarction; and\n- AG Snus Aktieselskab, a Danish company, and its Swedish subsidiary, Tobacco House of Sweden AB, fully owned by AG Snus, which operates in the oral tobacco and modern oral product categories.\n\nFor further details on these acquisitions, see Item 8, Note 6.

Through these processes, a manufacturer could receive (i) a 'not substantially equivalent' determination, (ii) a denial of a PMTA or (iii) a marketing order withdrawal by the FDA on one or more products, which would require the removal of the product or products from the market. Such actions could have a material adverse impact on the business and consolidated results of operations of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\nProvisional Products : Most cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by PM USA and USSTC are 'Provisional Products.' Altria's subsidiaries timely submitted SE reports for these Provisional Products. PM USA and USSTC have received SE determinations on certain Provisional Products. Those products that were found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent (certain smokeless tobacco products) had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA's determinations; therefore, those determinations did not impact business results. PM USA and USSTC have other Provisional Products that continue to be subject to the FDA's pre-market review process. In the meantime, they can continue marketing these products unless the FDA determines that a specific Provisional Product is not substantially equivalent.\n\nIn addition, the FDA has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of Provisional Product SE reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further FDA review. PM USA and USSTC have Provisional Products included in this subset of products.\n\nWhile Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies believe their current Provisional Products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, they cannot predict how the FDA will ultimately apply law, regulation and guidance to their various SE reports. Should Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies receive unfavorable determinations on any SE reports currently pending with the FDA, they believe they can replace the vast majority of their respective product volumes with other FDA authorized products or with Grandfathered Products.\n\nNon-Provisional Products : Cigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after March 22, 2011 are 'Non-Provisional Products' and must receive a marketing order from the FDA prior to being offered for sale. Marketing orders for Non-Provisional Products may be obtained by filing an SE report, PMTA or using another pre-market pathway established by the FDA. Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies may not be able to obtain a marketing order for non-provisional products because the FDA may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval.\n\nProducts Regulated in 2016 : Manufacturers of products first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an SE report or PMTA by the filing deadline of September 9, 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market. These products can remain on the market during FDA review through court-allowed, case-by-case discretion, so long as the report or application was timely filed with the FDA. Due to the large number of applications received by September 9, 2020, the FDA did not complete its review of all submitted applications by September 9, 2021, although it represents that it has made decisions on more than 98% of the applications, with most being marketing denial orders and a few marketing granted orders for tobacco flavor e-vapor products. A number of the marketing denial orders are subject to litigation challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers. For those products still under FDA review, it is uncertain when and for how long the FDA may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its case-by-case discretion. For products (new or modified) not on the market as of August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file an SE report or PMTA and receive FDA authorization prior to marketing and selling the product.\n\nHelix submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020. JUUL submitted PMTAs to the FDA for its e-vapor device and the related tobacco and menthol flavors in July 2020. As of February 22, 2022, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or JUUL products. In addition, as of February 22, 2022, Middleton has received market orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn December 2013, Altria's subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with PMI, including an agreement that grants Altria an exclusive right to commercialize certain of PMI's heated tobacco products in the United States, subject to FDA authorization of the applicable products. PMI submitted a PMTA and a MRTP application with the FDA for its electronically heated tobacco products comprising the IQOS Tobacco Heating System . The IQOS devices heat, but do not burn tobacco. In April 2019, the FDA authorized the PMTA for the IQOS Tobacco Heating System and in July 2020, the FDA authorized the marketing of this system as a MRTP with a reduced exposure claim. In December 2020, the FDA authorized the PMTA for IQOS 3, an updated version of the IQOS devices. The MRTP authorization for the original IQOS device currently does not apply to the IQOS 3 device. PMI submitted an MRTP application for the IQOS 3 device in March 2021, which is currently under review by the FDA.\n\nIn September 2021, in connection with a patent dispute, the ITC issued a cease and desist order, effective as of November 29, 2021, banning (i) the importation of the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and infringing components into the United States and (ii) the sale, marketing and distribution of such imported products in the United States.

      "question": "How did the evolution of PMI's PMTA submissions for IQOS devices between 2022 and 2024 influence MO's regulatory risk exposure and product strategy related to heated tobacco products in the U.S. market?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PMI had already submitted PMTAs for IQOS devices and received FDA authorization for IQOS 3 in December 2020, with an MRTP application under review. By 2024, MO had gained full ownership of NJOY's e-vapor portfolio, including Bluetooth-enabled ACE 2.0 devices with MGOs, and had re-submitted flavored pod PMTAs previously denied due to underage use concerns. This shift reflects a strategic pivot toward technologically differentiated products with enhanced age verification features, likely in response to both the regulatory challenges seen with IQOS and the evolving PMTA landscape. MO's 2024 disclosures highlight increased focus on post-market surveillance compliance and risk mitigation, indicating that earlier experiences with PMI's PMTA process shaped MO's more cautious and technology-driven regulatory approach.",

Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. Other than those amounts, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of any environmental remediation and compliance efforts that subsidiaries of Altria may undertake in the future. In the opinion of management, however, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows.\n\n## Guarantees and Other Similar Matters\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, certain subsidiaries of Altria have agreed to indemnify a limited number of third parties in the event of future litigation. At December 31, 2021, Altria and certain of its subsidiaries (i) had $48 million of unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and (ii) were contingently liable for guarantees related to their own performance, including $19 million for surety bonds recorded on its consolidated balance sheet. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries of Altria issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on Altria's liquidity.\n\nUnder the terms of a distribution agreement between Altria and PMI (the 'Distribution Agreement'), entered into as a result of Altria's 2008 spin-off of its former subsidiary PMI, liabilities concerning tobacco products will be allocated based in substantial part on the manufacturer. PMI will indemnify Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI. Altria does not have a related liability recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 as the fair value of this indemnification is insignificant. PMI has agreed not to seek indemnification with respect to the IQOS patent litigation discussed above under IQOS Litigation, excluding the patent infringement case filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\nPM USA has issued guarantees relating to Altria's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its $3.0 billion Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program.

      "answer": "In 2023, MO introduced oral nicotine pouches through Helix, a subsidiary it fully acquired in 2020-2021 for approximately $250 million, marking a strategic expansion into the smoke-free product segment. Helix's production of on! oral nicotine pouches became a key part of MO's portfolio, contributing to a broader smoke-free transition strategy. By 2024, MO explicitly positioned Helix as a 'leading manufacturer of oral nicotine pouches,' indicating that the product line had matured into a core strategic asset. This evolution supported MO's broader vision of transitioning adult smokers to potentially less harmful alternatives, with Helix playing a central role in the company's smoke-free product lineup alongside USSTC and NJOY.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PM acquired Swedish Match AB, which produced the ZYN nicotine pouch brand, integrating it into PM's broader smoke-free product portfolio. By 2023, this integration led to tangible financial effects in the Americas segment, where PM reported $18 million in purchase accounting adjustments related to the sale of acquired inventories that had been stepped up to fair value post-acquisition. This compares to $77 million in the same segment in 2022, indicating a significant reduction in inventory-related adjustments as the integration matured. The evolution of the ZYN brand under PM's portfolio thus contributed to a more stabilized financial performance in 2023 compared to the initial post-acquisition year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PM(2023) \u2192 ZYN (PRODUCT): PM introduced ZYN through the acquisition of Swedish Match AB in 2022, positioning it as a key part of its smoke-free portfolio.",
        "Hop 2: ZYN \u2192 Swedish Match AB (COMP): Swedish Match AB is the producer of ZYN, and its acquisition was a strategic move by PM to strengthen its position in oral nicotine delivery.",
        "Hop 3: Swedish Match AB \u2190 PM(2024): By 2023, the financial impact of the Swedish Match acquisition was evident in PM\u2019s segment reporting, particularly in the Americas, where inventory-related purchase accounting adjustments dropped from $77 million in 2022 to $18 million in 2023."

This pre-tax charge was recorded as a reduction of net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings, and was included in the SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA segment results for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n- Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles -For the year ended December 31, 2023, PMI recorded $680 million of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets impairment charges that was included in the Wellness and Healthcare segment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, PMI recorded an impairment charge related to definite-lived intangible assets of $112 million. This charge was included in the Wellness and Healthcare segment. For further details, see Note 5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net .\n- South Korea indirect tax charge -On July 13, 2023, PMI's South Korean subsidiary, PM Korea, received an adverse ruling from the Supreme Court of South Korea related to cases alleging underpayment of excise taxes in connection with a 2015 excise tax increase and subsequent audit by the South Korean Board of Audit and Inspection. The Supreme Court ruling reversed previous decisions that were in PM Korea's favor at the trial and appellate levels. As a result of the ruling, we concluded that an adverse outcome was probable. Consequently, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of $204 million in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earning, reflecting the full amount previously paid by PM Korea, which was included in the EA, AU &amp; PMI DF segment for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n- Termination  of  agreement  with  Foundation  for  a  Smoke-Free  World -On  September  29,  2023,  PMI  and  the  Foundation  for  a  Smoke-Free  World  (the \"Foundation\") entered into the Final G rant Agreement and Termination of the Second Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement (\"Agreement\"). Under the terms of the agreement, PMI paid $140 million in the third quarter of 2023 in return for the termination of the pledge agreement between the parties. As a result, in the third quarter of 2023, PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $140 million commensurate with the early termination of the pledge agreement. The pre-tax charge was recorded in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023 and was included in the operating results of the following segments: Europe ($60 million); SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA ($41  million); EA, AU &amp; PMI DF ($24 million); and Americas ($15 million).\n- Charges related to the war in U kraine -See Note 4.

      "question": "How did the evolution of advertising restrictions under the FSPTCA between 2022 and 2024 impact MO's ability to market new tobacco products, particularly in light of expanded FDA authority over synthetic nicotine products in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MO faced advertising restrictions primarily through the State Settlement Agreements, which prohibited outdoor and transit brand advertising, product placement, and youth-targeted marketing. These restrictions were further reinforced by the FSPTCA, which, as of April 2022, extended its advertising and marketing restrictions to include tobacco products containing synthetic nicotine. By 2024, MO was subject to the full scope of FSPTCA advertising rules, including prohibitions on brand-name sponsorships, sampling restrictions, and graphic warning requirements. The expansion of FSPTCA to synthetic nicotine products in 2024 significantly limited MO's ability to market new nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, as these were now subject to the same stringent advertising rules as traditional tobacco products. This regulatory tightening constrained MO's promotional strategies and increased compliance costs, particularly as the company had to adapt its marketing to avoid non-compliance penalties while maintaining brand visibility among adult consumers.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MO(2022) \u2192 Advertising Restrictions: MO faced advertising limitations from State Settlement Agreements, including bans on outdoor advertising, free sampling, and youth-targeted promotions.",
        "Hop 2: Advertising Restrictions \u2192 FSPTCA: The FSPTCA imposed comprehensive advertising rules, including restrictions on synthetic nicotine products effective April 2022.",
        "Hop 3: FSPTCA \u2190 MO(2024): By 2024, MO was fully subject to FSPTCA advertising rules, which now included synthetic nicotine products, increasing compliance burdens and limiting promotional flexibility."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nproposals or the impact of any FCTC actions on legislation or regulation in the U.S., either indirectly or as a result of the U.S. becoming a party to the FCTC, or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence FDA regulation and enforcement.\n\n## State Settlement Agreements\n\nAs discussed in Note 18, during 1997 and 1998, PM USA and other major domestic cigarette manufacturers entered into the State Settlement Agreements. These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2021, the inflation calculation was approximately 7% based on the latest CPI-U data; however, the increase in the annual payments did not have a material impact on Altria's financial position. Altria believes that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022, but does not expect the corresponding increase in annual payments to result in a material financial impact. However, we will continue to monitor conditions related to the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment.\n\nFor a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below and Note 18. The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers' business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). The State Settlement Agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters. In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; limit the industry's ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.\n\nIn November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the 'STMSA') with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC. The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions. USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.\n\n## Other International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity\n\n- International, Federal, State and Local Regulation: Various states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches), such as legislation that (i) prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories, such as e-vapor, (ii) prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors, such as menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, (iii) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings and (iv) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products. The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products. As of February 22, 2022, multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products, and six states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Utah, New York and Illinois) and the District of Columbia have passed such legislation. Some of these states, such as New York, Utah and Illinois, exempt certain products that have received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway.\n\nThe legislation in California bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors, including menthol, mint and wintergreen. Following enactment of the flavor ban in August 2020, several registered California voters filed a referendum against the legislation. In January 2021 the requisite number of registered California voters signed a petition to place the question of whether the legislation should be affirmed or overturned on the next statewide general election ballot, which will likely take place in November 2022, unless a special statewide election is called earlier. As a result, the implementation of the legislation is delayed until after a vote on the referendum occurs.\n\nMassachusetts passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in e-vapor products. Similar legislation is pending in one other state.\n\nRestrictions on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products also have been instituted or proposed internationally.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal, state and local legislation and other governmental action, including through litigation. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL. Such action also could negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.",

For the fourth quarter of 2024, the discount share of the cigarette category reached 30.4%, an increase of 0.6 share points sequentially and an increase of 1.7 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe continue to monitor the evolving regulatory, macroeconomic and consumer dynamics within our business environment for impacts on our businesses. Changes in these and other conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## FSPTCA and FDA Regulation\n\n- The Regulatory Framework: The FSPTCA and its related regulations establish broad FDA regulatory authority over all tobacco products and, among other provisions:\n- impose restrictions on the advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products (see Final Tobacco Marketing Rule below);\n- establish pre-market review pathways for new and modified tobacco products (see Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement below);\n- prohibit any express or implied claims that a tobacco product is or may be less harmful than other tobacco products without FDA authorization;\n- authorize the FDA to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health (see Potential Product Standards below); and\n- equip the FDA with a variety of investigatory and enforcement tools, including the authority to inspect product manufacturing and other facilities (see Investigation and Enforcement below).\n\nThe FSPTCA also bans descriptors such as 'light,' 'low' or 'mild' when used as descriptors of modified risk, unless expressly authorized by the FDA.\n\nEffective April 2022, the U.S. Congress expanded the statutory definition of tobacco products to include products containing nicotine derived from any source, including synthetic nicotine. See Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement below for additional information on the effects of the statutory change. Currently, however, the statutory definition of tobacco products does not cover products containing nicotine analogues, which are designed to imitate the effects of nicotine. As a result, products containing nicotine analogues are not subject to the FDA regulatory framework for tobacco products, including the requirements that manufacturers submit a PMTA to, and receive an MGO from, the FDA before marketing such products in the United States.\n\n- Final Tobacco Marketing Rule: As required by the FSPTCA, in March 2010, the FDA promulgated a wide range of advertising and promotion restrictions for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products (the 'Final Tobacco Marketing Rule'). The May 2016 deeming regulations amended the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule to expand specific provisions to all tobacco products, including cigars, pipe tobacco and e-vapor and oral nicotine products containing tobacco-derived nicotine or other tobacco derivatives. (1)\n\nThe Final Tobacco Marketing Rule, as amended, among other things:\n\n- restricts the use of non-tobacco trade and brand names on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products;\n- prohibits sampling of all tobacco products except that sampling of smokeless tobacco products is permitted in qualified adult-only facilities;\n- prohibits the sale or distribution of items such as hats and tee shirts with cigarette or smokeless tobacco brands or logos;\n- prohibits cigarettes and smokeless tobacco brand name sponsorship of any athletic, musical, artistic or other social or cultural event, or any entry or team in any event; and\n- requires the development by the FDA of graphic warnings for cigarettes, establishes warning requirements for other tobacco products and gives the FDA the authority to require new warnings for any type of tobacco product (see FDA Regulatory Actions - Graphic Warnings below).\n\nSubject to certain limitations arising from legal challenges, the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule took effect in June 2010 for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products, in August 2016 for all other tobacco products, including e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products containing tobacco-derived nicotine, and in April 2022 for tobacco products, including e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products, that contain nicotine from any source other than tobacco, such as synthetic nicotine. The Final Tobacco Marketing Rule currently does not apply to products containing nicotine analogues.\n\n- Rulemaking and Guidance: From time to time, the FDA issues proposed regulations and guidance, which may be issued in draft or final form, that generally involve public comment and may include scientific review. The FDA also may request comments on\n\n'Smokeless tobacco,' as used in this section of this Form 10-K, refers to smokeless tobacco products first regulated by the FDA in 2009, including MST. It excludes oral nicotine pouches, which were first regulated by the FDA in 2016. (1)",

The proposed rule is subject to the Trump Administration's January 2025 executive order pausing all federal agency rulemaking for 60 days. Following the 60-day pause, the proposed product standard, if not withdrawn, may proceed through the rulemaking process, including the solicitation of public comment, which we believe would take multiple years to complete.\n- Flavors in Tobacco Products : In April 2022, the FDA issued two proposed product standards: (i) banning menthol in cigarettes and (ii) banning all characterizing flavors (including menthol) in cigars. We submitted comments during the notice-and-comment period. In October 2023, the FDA submitted the two proposed product standards to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review. In April 2024, the FDA announced the indefinite delay of a decision on the menthol ban, citing the high volume of feedback received during the notice-and-comment period. In January 2025, the Trump Administration withdrew the two proposed product standards from the Office of Management and Budget ('OMB') and sent them back to the FDA.\n- N-nitrosonornicotine ('NNN') in Smokeless Tobacco : In January 2017, the FDA proposed a product standard for NNN levels in finished smokeless tobacco products.\n\nIf any one or more of the foregoing potential product standards were to become final and was appealed and upheld in the courts, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position, including a material adverse effect on the carrying value of certain of our assets such as our cigar trademarks.\n\n- Tobacco Product Manufacturing Practices: In March 2023, the FDA, pursuant to the requirements of the FSPTCA, issued a proposed rule setting forth requirements for tobacco product manufacturers regarding the manufacture, design, packing and storage of their products. This proposed rule establishes a framework of tobacco product manufacturing practices, including by:\n- establishing tobacco product design and development controls;\n- ensuring that finished and bulk tobacco products are manufactured according to established specifications;\n- minimizing the manufacture and distribution of tobacco products that do not meet specifications;\n- requiring manufacturers to take appropriate measures to prevent contamination of tobacco products;\n- requiring investigation and identification of products that do not meet specifications and requiring manufacturers to institute appropriate corrective actions, such as a recall; and\n- establishing the ability to trace all components or parts, ingredients, additives and materials, as well as each batch of finished or bulk tobacco products, to aid in investigations of those that do not meet specifications.\n\nWe engaged with the FDA through the rulemaking process, including during the notice-and-comment period, which closed in October 2023. OMB currently lists the rule as a long-term action. If the proposed rule were to take effect, our operating companies could experience increased costs to comply with the rule.\n\n- Impact on Our Business; Compliance Costs and User Fees: Additional FDA regulatory actions under the FSPTCA could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position in various ways. For ex ample, actions (or inaction) by the FDA could:\n- impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products;\n- discontinue, delay or prevent the sale or distribution of ex isting, new or modified tobacco products;\n- limit adult tobacco consumer choices;\n- impose restrictions on communications with adult tobacco consumers;\n- create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies;\n- impose additional manufacturing, labeling or packaging requirements;\n- impose additional restrictions at retail;\n- result in increased illicit trade in tobacco products; and\n- otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business.\n\nThe FSPTCA imposes user fees on cigarette, cigarette tobacco, smokeless tobacco, cigar and pipe tobacco manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters. The FSPTCA does not impose user fees on e-vapor products or oral nicotine pouch manufacturers. The cost of the FDA user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to FDA user fees and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares, all as prescribed by the FSPTCA and FDA regulations. Payments for user fees are adjusted for several factors, including market share and industry volume. See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below for a discussion of our FDA user fee payments. In addition, our operating companies' compliance with the FSPTCA's regulatory requirements has resulted, and will continue to result, in additional costs. The amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year-to-date period but could become material, either individually or in the aggregate.

      "answer": "In 2023, Coca-Cola's juice, value-added dairy, and plant-based beverages negatively impacted unit case volume in EMEA, contributing to a 14% decline in that category and a 2% overall decrease in unit case volume for the region. By 2024, the performance of this product category had improved significantly, showing a 5% decline in EMEA\u2014still a negative impact but notably better than the previous year. Despite this improvement, EMEA unit case volume remained flat overall in 2024, suggesting that while the juice and dairy segment showed signs of stabilization, it was not enough to drive overall growth in the region. This indicates a potential strategic focus on stabilizing the category rather than driving aggressive expansion in EMEA.",

The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for the operating segments were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals.",

      "question": "How did the evolution of advertising restrictions under the FSPTCA between 2023 and 2024 affect MO's marketing strategy for smokeless tobacco and e-vapor products?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MO was subject to advertising restrictions stemming from the State Settlement Agreements, which prohibited outdoor and transit brand advertising, product placement payments, and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). These restrictions also limited brand-name sponsorships and prohibited youth-targeted marketing. By 2024, the FSPTCA had further expanded these advertising constraints through the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule, which applied to all tobacco products including e-vapor and oral nicotine pouches containing tobacco-derived or synthetic nicotine. The rule prohibited the sale or distribution of promotional items with tobacco branding, restricted brand-sponsored events, and imposed sampling limitations. MO had to adapt its marketing strategy to comply with these broader federal restrictions, particularly for newer product categories like e-vapor and oral nicotine pouches, while continuing to manage under the earlier state-level advertising constraints. This dual layer of regulation in 2024 required MO to further limit its promotional activities and increase compliance costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MO(2023) \u2192 Advertising Restrictions: MO was subject to advertising restrictions from State Settlement Agreements, including prohibitions on outdoor advertising, sampling, and youth-targeted promotions.",
        "Hop 2: Advertising Restrictions \u2192 FSPTCA: The Final Tobacco Marketing Rule under FSPTCA expanded federal advertising restrictions to include all tobacco products, such as e-vapor and oral nicotine pouches, with enforcement timelines extending into 2024.",
        "Hop 3: FSPTCA \u2190 MO(2024): MO faced increased compliance costs and marketing limitations under the FSPTCA in 2024, particularly affecting newer product categories like e-vapor and oral nicotine pouches."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDiscretionary income pressures on adult tobacco consumers have influenced discount brand share performance. For the fourth quarter of 2024, the discount share of the cigarette category reached 30.4%, an increase of 0.6 share points sequentially and an increase of 1.7 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe continue to monitor the evolving regulatory, macroeconomic and consumer dynamics within our business environment for impacts on our businesses. Changes in these and other conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## FSPTCA and FDA Regulation\n\n- The Regulatory Framework: The FSPTCA and its related regulations establish broad FDA regulatory authority over all tobacco products and, among other provisions:\n- impose restrictions on the advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products (see Final Tobacco Marketing Rule below);\n- establish pre-market review pathways for new and modified tobacco products (see Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement below);\n- prohibit any express or implied claims that a tobacco product is or may be less harmful than other tobacco products without FDA authorization;\n- authorize the FDA to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health (see Potential Product Standards below); and\n- equip the FDA with a variety of investigatory and enforcement tools, including the authority to inspect product manufacturing and other facilities (see Investigation and Enforcement below).\n\nThe FSPTCA also bans descriptors such as 'light,' 'low' or 'mild' when used as descriptors of modified risk, unless expressly authorized by the FDA.\n\nEffective April 2022, the U.S. Congress expanded the statutory definition of tobacco products to include products containing nicotine derived from any source, including synthetic nicotine. See Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement below for additional information on the effects of the statutory change. Currently, however, the statutory definition of tobacco products does not cover products containing nicotine analogues, which are designed to imitate the effects of nicotine. As a result, products containing nicotine analogues are not subject to the FDA regulatory framework for tobacco products, including the requirements that manufacturers submit a PMTA to, and receive an MGO from, the FDA before marketing such products in the United States.\n\n- Final Tobacco Marketing Rule: As required by the FSPTCA, in March 2010, the FDA promulgated a wide range of advertising and promotion restrictions for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products (the 'Final Tobacco Marketing Rule'). The May 2016 deeming regulations amended the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule to expand specific provisions to all tobacco products, including cigars, pipe tobacco and e-vapor and oral nicotine products containing tobacco-derived nicotine or other tobacco derivatives. (1)\n\nThe Final Tobacco Marketing Rule, as amended, among other things:\n\n- restricts the use of non-tobacco trade and brand names on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products;\n- prohibits sampling of all tobacco products except that sampling of smokeless tobacco products is permitted in qualified adult-only facilities;\n- prohibits the sale or distribution of items such as hats and tee shirts with cigarette or smokeless tobacco brands or logos;\n- prohibits cigarettes and smokeless tobacco brand name sponsorship of any athletic, musical, artistic or other social or cultural event, or any entry or team in any event; and\n- requires the development by the FDA of graphic warnings for cigarettes, establishes warning requirements for other tobacco products and gives the FDA the authority to require new warnings for any type of tobacco product (see FDA Regulatory Actions - Graphic Warnings below).\n\nSubject to certain limitations arising from legal challenges, the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule took effect in June 2010 for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products, in August 2016 for all other tobacco products, including e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products containing tobacco-derived nicotine, and in April 2022 for tobacco products, including e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products, that contain nicotine from any source other than tobacco, such as synthetic nicotine. The Final Tobacco Marketing Rule currently does not apply to products containing nicotine analogues.\n\n- Rulemaking and Guidance: From time to time, the FDA issues proposed regulations and guidance, which may be issued in draft or final form, that generally involve public comment and may include scientific review. The FDA also may request comments on\n\n'Smokeless tobacco,' as used in this section of this Form 10-K, refers to smokeless tobacco products first regulated by the FDA in 2009, including MST. It excludes oral nicotine pouches, which were first regulated by the FDA in 2016. (1)",

The proposed rule is subject to the Trump Administration's January 2025 executive order pausing all federal agency rulemaking for 60 days. Following the 60-day pause, the proposed product standard, if not withdrawn, may proceed through the rulemaking process, including the solicitation of public comment, which we believe would take multiple years to complete.\n- Flavors in Tobacco Products : In April 2022, the FDA issued two proposed product standards: (i) banning menthol in cigarettes and (ii) banning all characterizing flavors (including menthol) in cigars. We submitted comments during the notice-and-comment period. In October 2023, the FDA submitted the two proposed product standards to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review. In April 2024, the FDA announced the indefinite delay of a decision on the menthol ban, citing the high volume of feedback received during the notice-and-comment period. In January 2025, the Trump Administration withdrew the two proposed product standards from the Office of Management and Budget ('OMB') and sent them back to the FDA.\n- N-nitrosonornicotine ('NNN') in Smokeless Tobacco : In January 2017, the FDA proposed a product standard for NNN levels in finished smokeless tobacco products.\n\nIf any one or more of the foregoing potential product standards were to become final and was appealed and upheld in the courts, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position, including a material adverse effect on the carrying value of certain of our assets such as our cigar trademarks.\n\n- Tobacco Product Manufacturing Practices: In March 2023, the FDA, pursuant to the requirements of the FSPTCA, issued a proposed rule setting forth requirements for tobacco product manufacturers regarding the manufacture, design, packing and storage of their products. This proposed rule establishes a framework of tobacco product manufacturing practices, including by:\n- establishing tobacco product design and development controls;\n- ensuring that finished and bulk tobacco products are manufactured according to established specifications;\n- minimizing the manufacture and distribution of tobacco products that do not meet specifications;\n- requiring manufacturers to take appropriate measures to prevent contamination of tobacco products;\n- requiring investigation and identification of products that do not meet specifications and requiring manufacturers to institute appropriate corrective actions, such as a recall; and\n- establishing the ability to trace all components or parts, ingredients, additives and materials, as well as each batch of finished or bulk tobacco products, to aid in investigations of those that do not meet specifications.\n\nWe engaged with the FDA through the rulemaking process, including during the notice-and-comment period, which closed in October 2023. OMB currently lists the rule as a long-term action. If the proposed rule were to take effect, our operating companies could experience increased costs to comply with the rule.\n\n- Impact on Our Business; Compliance Costs and User Fees: Additional FDA regulatory actions under the FSPTCA could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position in various ways. For ex ample, actions (or inaction) by the FDA could:\n- impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products;\n- discontinue, delay or prevent the sale or distribution of ex isting, new or modified tobacco products;\n- limit adult tobacco consumer choices;\n- impose restrictions on communications with adult tobacco consumers;\n- create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies;\n- impose additional manufacturing, labeling or packaging requirements;\n- impose additional restrictions at retail;\n- result in increased illicit trade in tobacco products; and\n- otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business.\n\nThe FSPTCA imposes user fees on cigarette, cigarette tobacco, smokeless tobacco, cigar and pipe tobacco manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters. The FSPTCA does not impose user fees on e-vapor products or oral nicotine pouch manufacturers. The cost of the FDA user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to FDA user fees and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares, all as prescribed by the FSPTCA and FDA regulations. Payments for user fees are adjusted for several factors, including market share and industry volume. See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below for a discussion of our FDA user fee payments. In addition, our operating companies' compliance with the FSPTCA's regulatory requirements has resulted, and will continue to result, in additional costs. The amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year-to-date period but could become material, either individually or in the aggregate.

      "question": "How did the structure and terms of Altria's debt guarantees by PM USA evolve from 2022 to 2023, particularly in light of new debt issuances and changes in guarantee conditions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PM USA fully and unconditionally guaranteed Altria's obligations under its debt securities, with guarantees subject to release under certain customary circumstances, such as a change in control or repayment of obligations. By 2023, Altria issued $1.0 billion in new senior unsecured notes, which were also covered under the PM USA guarantees. Notably, the 2023 debt terms included a requirement for Altria to repurchase the notes at 101% of principal if both a change of control occurred and the notes were downgraded below investment grade by all three major rating agencies. This condition was not explicitly mentioned in the 2022 documentation, indicating a tightening of guarantee terms in response to potential credit risk. Additionally, in 2023, Altria filed a new shelf registration (Form S-3) allowing for future debt issuances, which would also fall under PM USA's guarantee framework.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MO(2022) \u2192 PM USA: Altria's 2022 financial statements emphasized the unconditional guarantee by PM USA of Altria's debt obligations, including under what conditions the guarantee could be released.",
        "Hop 2: PM USA \u2192 MO Debt Securities: The guarantee structure was central to the debt securities, with PM USA acting as the guarantor for Altria's obligations under its debt instruments.",
        "Hop 3: MO Debt Securities \u2190 MO(2023): In 2023, new debt issuances and the filing of a new Form S-3 registration reflected an evolution in the guarantee framework, including new repurchase conditions tied to credit ratings and control changes."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n\nPM USA (the 'Guarantor'), which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

As further discussed in Note 19, as part of the supplier financing program, Altria guarantees the financial obligations of ALCS under the financing program agreement. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 10, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Long-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates.

Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

      "answer": "In 2023, MO issued $1.0 billion in new senior unsecured notes and maintained PM USA as a guarantor for its debt obligations, reinforcing PM USA's central role in supporting MO's financial commitments. By 2024, this relationship was reflected in MO's disclosures around PM USA, particularly in the context of litigation-related deposits and the risk of impairment charges\u2014such as the $125 million hypothetical impairment linked to the e-vapor unit's performance and the $35 million in appeal bonds collateralized by restricted cash.

of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2023. From time to time, we also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. As further discussed in Note 19, as part of the supplier financing program, Altria guarantees the financial obligations of ALCS under the financing program agreement. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 10, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Long-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates.

Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results.

Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

      "answer": "In 2022, Altria disclosed under its distribution agreement with PMI that PMI would indemnify Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured by PM USA. Altria did not record a liability for this indemnification as its fair value was deemed insignificant. By 2024, Altria's disclosures through PM USA highlighted increased sensitivity around impairment risks, particularly for its e-vapor reporting unit, which had a carrying value of $1.8 billion in goodwill and $1.1 billion in definite-lived intangible assets. These assets were sensitive to changes in discount rates, with a 1% increase potentially triggering a $125 million impairment charge. While PM USA continued to guarantee Altria's debt obligations, the evolving regulatory and market conditions affecting e-vapor products introduced new financial risks not fully mitigated by the indemnification framework established in 2022.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PM ended its commercial relationship with Altria regarding Platform 1 in the U.S., transferring full commercialization rights to PMI by April 2024. This change triggered scrutiny from the U.S. government, which interpreted the transaction as falling under the 2006 Order that restricts Altria and PM USA from transferring cigarette-related assets without the transferee submitting to the jurisdiction of the court and the Order\u2019s terms. In 2023, the U.S. government informed Altria that PMI must submit to the 2006 Order before the transaction could proceed, raising the potential for increased regulatory exposure for PMI, despite not being a defendant in the original case. While PMI believes the cited provision is inapplicable, the evolving interpretation of the Order by the government introduced uncertainty around the timing and execution of the agreement.",

        "Hop 3: [2006 Order] \u2190 [PM](2023): In 2023, the U.S. government asserted that the 2022 Agreement fell under the scope of the 2006 Order, requiring PMI to submit to its jurisdiction, potentially delaying or altering the transaction."

Plaintiffs'  allegations  of  liability  in  these  cases  are  based  on  various  theories  of  recovery, including  negligence,  gross  negligence,  strict  liability,  fraud,  misrepresentation,  design  defect,  failure  to  warn,  breach  of  express  and implied warranties, violations of deceptive trade practice laws and consumer protection statutes. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief, including compensatory and other damages, and injunctive and equitable relief. Defenses raised in these cases include licit activity, failure to state a claim, lack of defect, lack of proximate cause, assumption of the risk, contributory negligence, and statute of limitations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were a number of smoking and health cases pending against us, our subsidiaries or indemnitees, as follows:\n\n- 40 cases brought by individual plaintiffs in Argentina (31), Brazil (2), Canada (2), Chile (1), the Philippines (1), Turkey (1) and Scotland (1), as well as 1 case brought by an individual plaintiff in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon in May 2021.

'\n\nHealth  Care  Cost  Recovery  Litigation: These  cases,  brought  by  governmental  and  non-governmental  plaintiffs,  seek  reimbursement  of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products. Plaintiffs' allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including unjust enrichment, negligence, negligent design, strict liability, breach of express and implied warranties, violation  of  a  voluntary  undertaking  or  special  duty,  fraud,  negligent  misrepresentation,  conspiracy,  public  nuisance,  defective  product, failure to warn, sale of cigarettes to minors, and claims under statutes governing competition and deceptive trade practices. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief including compensatory and other damages, and injunctive and equitable relief. Defenses raised in these cases include lack of proximate cause, remoteness of injury, failure to state a claim, adequate remedy at law, 'unclean hands' (namely, that  plaintiffs  cannot  obtain  equitable  relief  because  they  participated  in,  and  benefited  from,  the  sale  of  cigarettes),  and  statute  of limitations.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PM USA's guarantee of Altria's commercial paper program was part of a broader set of guarantees covering Altria's debt obligations, with specific emphasis on the unconditional nature of the guarantee and the potential for voidance under fraudulent conveyance laws. By 2023, Altria issued $1.0 billion in new senior unsecured notes, which were used for general corporate purposes, signaling a shift in financing strategy. This was accompanied by repayments of $1.3 billion in Euro-denominated notes and $218 million in senior unsecured notes, indicating active debt management. The commercial paper program remained guaranteed by PM USA, but the overall debt structure and liquidity approach evolved with new issuances and repayments, reflecting strategic adjustments in capital structure.",

The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 10, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Long-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Purchase Obligations - We have entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results.

      "question": "How did the change in PM USA's appeal bond postings from 2022 to 2024 reflect shifts in MO's litigation risk exposure and financial obligations related to tobacco-related judgments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling approximately $50 million, collateralized with restricted cash, to obtain stays of adverse tobacco-related judgments pending appeal. By 2024, this amount had decreased to $31 million, indicating a reduction in the number or value of judgments being appealed. This decline suggests that MO's litigation risk exposure related to tobacco health cases may have lessened over time, either through settlements, dismissals, or successful appeals. Additionally, the decrease in appeal bond postings implies a corresponding reduction in the short-term financial obligations tied to litigation stays, potentially freeing up liquidity for other strategic uses such as the ASR transactions and NJOY contingent payments noted in 2024.",

(the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

Pre-tax charges for related interest costs were included in interest and other debt expense, net on Altria's consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\nAfter exhausting all appeals in those cases resulting in adverse verdicts associated with tobacco-related litigation, since October 2004, PM USA has paid judgments and settlements (including related costs and fees) totaling approximately $896 million and interest totaling approximately $227 million as of December 31, 2021. These amounts include payments for Engle progeny judgments (and related costs and fees) totaling approximately $410 million and related interest totaling approximately $56 million.\n\nSecurity for Judgments: To obtain stays of judgments pending appeal, PM USA has posted various forms of security.

We used the proceeds from the ABI Transaction to fund the ASR transactions discussed below.\n\nNJOY Contingent Payments - In the second quarter of 2024, the FDA issued MGOs for four NJOY e-vapor menthol products. As a result, we became obligated to make cash payments totaling $250 million under the acquisition agreement, which we made in July 2024. For further discussion on the NJOY contingent payments, see Note 3 .\n\nIn October 2023, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, under which we may offer debt securities or warrants to purchase debt securities from time to time over a three-year period from the date of filing.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Future Contractual Obligations\n\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, other than guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below.\n\nGuarantees and Other Similar Matters - As discussed in Note 20, we had unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2024. From time to time, we also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. As further discussed in Note 5. Supplier Financing to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, as part of the supplier financing program, Altria guarantees the financial obligations of ALCS under the financing program agreement. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 11, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on our liquidity.\n\nLong-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 11.\n\nPurchase Obligations - We have entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fix ed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2024, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.8 billion and $2.3 billion thereafter.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had $0.9 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 and are excluded from the amounts above.\n\nPayments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of State Settlement Agreements, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation in Note 20.\n\nBased on current agreements, estimated annual industry volume decline rates, estimated operating income, estimated market share and inflation, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.0 billion on average for the next three years. This estimate no longer includes PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to make quarterly payments with respect to settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees due to the termination of these obligations in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount ex cludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.\n\nThe estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $3.9 billion and $4.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, which are primarily paid in the second quarter of each period. The payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, market share and inflation. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the ex tent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment - State Settlement Agreements above.\n\nLitigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2024, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $31 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\nLitigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 20, Item 3 and Item 1A.",

      "answer": "Mondel\u0113z updated its Value at Risk (VAR) modeling methodology between 2023 and 2024 by adopting a parametric delta-gamma approximation technique to estimate return distributions in interest rates, currencies, and commodity prices, replacing the earlier variance/co-variance approach. This methodological shift, combined with reduced interest rate volatility observed during the period, contributed to the decline in the estimated maximum potential one-day loss, which fell to $255 million by September 28, 2024, from $284 million on September 30, 2023. The new model incorporated more granular historical data, using movements from the prior quarter for quarterly calculations and data from the previous four quarters for annual averages, enhancing the precision of risk estimation.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Target received a percentage of the profits generated by the Target Credit Card and Target MasterCard receivables through its agreement with TD, where TD underwrote, funded, and owned the receivables. By 2024, Target continued to offer the Target Credit Card as part of its Target Circle Cards, which included a 5% discount on purchases. However, the penetration rate of Target Circle Cards declined from 19.8% in 2023 to 18.6% in 2024, suggesting a reduced usage of these cards despite their continued integration into the loyalty program. This decline may indicate a weakening in the effectiveness of the credit card partnership in driving incremental sales, even as the gross margin improved year-over-year.",

The collectiv e interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitiv e, and consumer behav ioral factors, as well as sales mix, and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible.\n\nTD Bank Group offers credit to qualified guests through T arget-branded credit cards: the T arget Credit Card and the T arget MasterCard Credit Card (T arget Credit  Cards). Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary  T arget  Debit  Card and  T arget  Circle  Card  Reloadable Account.  Collectiv ely, we refer to these products as T arget Circle Cards. Guests receiv e a 5 percent discount on v irtually all purchases when they use a T arget Circle Card at T arget. We monitor the percentage of purchases that are paid for using T arget Circle Cards (T arget Circle Card Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful  portion  of  incremental  purchases  on  our  T arget  Circle  Cards  are  also  incremental  sales  for  T arget.  For  the  years  ended  February  1,  2025, February 3, 2024, and  January 28, 2023, total  T arget  Circle  Card  Penetration  was  17.8  percent,  18.6  percent,  and  19.8  percent,  respectiv ely.

The increase reflected the net impact of\n\n- merchandising activ ities, including cost improv ements which more than offset higher promotional and clearance markdown rates, as well as growth in adv ertising and marketplace rev enues;\n- lower book to physical inv entory adjustments in 2024; and\n- higher supply chain &amp; digital fulfillment costs due to new supply chain facilities coming online and an increase in digital v olume.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative (SG&amp;A) Expense Rate\n\nOur SG&amp;A expense rate was 20.6 percent in 2024, compared with 20.0 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of cost increases across our business, including higher team member pay and benefits and higher general liability expenses, partially offset by the benefit of lower store remodel-related expenses.\n\nTA RGET CORPORA TION\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n28",

      "answer": "In 2022, MO's business remained heavily reliant on tobacco products, which were subject to the FDA's PMTA requirements, particularly for newer products introduced after August 8, 2016. The 2022 report highlighted the importance of the PMTA process in determining which products could legally remain on the market. By 2023, MO faced increased regulatory risk exposure due to the FDA's enforcement actions and delayed PMTA decisions. For example, Helix (a subsidiary) submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020, but as of February 23, 2024, no marketing orders had been issued, leaving these products in regulatory limbo. Similarly, despite some PMTA authorizations for Marlboro HeatSticks and IQOS devices, the FDA's enforcement of PMTA outcomes\u2014combined with a patent-related ITC cease-and-desist order\u2014led to the removal of IQOS devices and HeatSticks from the market. This illustrates how MO's continued reliance on tobacco products in 2022 exposed the company to significant regulatory uncertainty in 2023, directly tied to the PMTA process.",

The FDA also may request comments on broad topics through an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ('ANPRM'). Altria's tobacco operating companies actively engage with the FDA to develop and implement the FSPTCA's regulatory framework, including submission of comments to various FDA policies and proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions.\n\nThe FDA's implementation of the FSPTCA and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by United States states, territories and localities of their laws and regulations as well as of the State Settlement Agreements discussed below (see State Settlement Agreements below).  Such enforcement efforts may adversely affect the ability of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees to market and sell regulated tobacco products in those states, territories and localities.\n\n- FDA's Comprehensive Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation: In July 2017, the FDA announced a 'Comprehensive Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation' ('Comprehensive Plan') designed to strike a balance between regulation and encouraging the development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes. Since then, the FDA has issued additional information about its Comprehensive Plan in response to concerns associated with the rise in the use of e-vapor products by youth and the potential youth appeal of flavored tobacco products (see Underage Access and Use of Certain Tobacco Products below). As part of the Comprehensive Plan, the FDA:\n- issued ANPRMs relating to potential product standards for nicotine in cigarettes, flavors in all tobacco products (including menthol in cigarettes and characterizing flavors in all cigars) and, for e-vapor products, to protect against known public health risks such as concerns about youth exposure to liquid nicotine;\n- took actions to restrict youth access to e-vapor products; and\n- reconsidered the processes used by the FDA to review certain reports and new product applications.\n- Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement: The FSPTCA permits the sale of tobacco products on the market as of February 15, 2007 and not subsequently modified ('Grandfathered Products') and new or modified products authorized through the PMTA, Substantial Equivalence ('SE') or SE Exemption pathways. Subsequent FDA rules also provide a Supplemental PMTA pathway designed to increase the efficiency of submission and review for modified versions of previously authorized products.\n\nThe FDA pre-market authorization enforcement policy varies based on product type and date of availability in the market, specifically:\n\n- Grandfathered Products are exempt from the pre-market authorization requirement;\n- cigarette and smokeless tobacco products that were modified or first introduced into the market between February 15, 2007 and March 22, 2011 are generally considered 'Provisional Products' for which SE reports were required to be filed by March 22, 2011. These reports must demonstrate that the product has the same characteristics as a product on the market as of February 15, 2007 or to a product previously determined to be substantially equivalent, or has different characteristics but does not raise different questions of public health; and\n- tobacco products that were first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches that are not Grandfathered Products, are generally products for which either an SE report or PMTA needed to be filed by September 9, 2020.",

      "question": "How did MDLZ's chocolate segment performance in 2022 influence its operational footprint in the AMEA region in 2023, given the relative importance of chocolate to AMEA's revenue mix?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ's chocolate segment generated $2,082 million in revenue from the AMEA region, making it the second-largest contributor after Europe. Chocolate accounted for 8.3% of AMEA's total net revenues, highlighting its significance to the region's revenue mix. By 2023, MDLZ continued to operate in the AMEA region, with total assets in that region reaching $9,965 million, slightly increasing from $9,882 million in 2022. This suggests that MDLZ maintained and slightly expanded its operational footprint in AMEA in 2023, likely supported by the continued performance of its chocolate business, which remained a key revenue driver in that region.",

        "Hop 1: MDLZ(2022) \u2192 Chocolate: Chocolate generated $2,082 million in revenue from AMEA in 2022, indicating its strong contribution to the region's performance.",

      "answer": "MO's acquisition of full ownership in Helix in April 2021 allowed the company to scale up production capacity for on! oral nicotine pouches, achieving unconstrained manufacturing capacity by the end of 2021. This strategic move enabled Helix to increase the retail share of on! to 3.9% in Q4 2021, up 2.8 percentage points from Q4 2020. By 2023, MO had integrated Helix's oral nicotine pouches into its broader oral tobacco product portfolio, reflecting a strategic pivot toward modern nicotine delivery systems as traditional MST and snus volumes declined by 2.2% year-over-year. This evolution shows MO's deliberate focus on transitioning adult consumers toward next-generation nicotine products as part of its 'Moving Beyond Smoking' vision.",

          "chunk_text": "\nNote: The oral tobacco products segment retail share results exclude international volume, which is currently not material. Retail share results for oral tobacco products are based on data from IRI InfoScan, a tracking service that uses a sample of stores to project market share and depict share trends. This service tracks sales in the food, drug, mass merchandisers, convenience, military, dollar store and club trade classes on the number of cans and packs sold. Oral tobacco products is defined by IRI as MST, snus and oral nicotine pouches. New types of oral tobacco products, as well as new packaging configurations of existing oral tobacco products, may or may not be equivalent to existing MST products on a can-for-can basis. For example, one pack of snus or one can of oral nicotine pouches, irrespective of the number of pouches in the pack or can, is assumed to be equivalent to one can of MST. Because this service represents retail share performance only in key trade channels, it should not be considered a precise measurement of actual retail share. It is IRI's standard practice to periodically refresh its InfoScan services, which could restate retail share results that were previously released in this service.\n\nFor a discussion of volume trends and factors that impact volume and retail share performance, see Tobacco Space - Business Environment above.\n\n## 2021 Compared with 2020\n\nThe oral tobacco products segment's reported domestic shipment volume was essentially unchanged as the industry's growth rate and trade inventory movements were essentially offset by retail share losses and calendar differences. When adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences, the oral tobacco products segment's reported domestic shipment volume decreased by an estimated 0.5%.\n\nTotal oral tobacco products category industry volume increased by an estimated 2% over the six months ended December 31, 2021, driven by growth in oral nicotine pouches.\n\nRetail share losses in the oral tobacco products segment, including Copenhage n, were due to the growth of oral nicotine pouches.\n\nTotal U.S. oral tobacco category share for on! nicotine pouches grew to 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 2.8 percentage points versus the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nIn 2021, Helix achieved unconstrained on! manufacturing capacity for the current estimated size of the U.S. oral nicotine pouch category.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, on! was available for sale in approximately 117,000 U.S. stores.",

      "question": "What does the -$219 million fair value of MDLZ's Net Investment Hedge Contracts in 2023 reveal about their Level 2 financial assets exposure, particularly in comparison to the earlier disclosure framework MDLZ provided in 2022?",
      "answer": "The -$219 million fair value of MDLZ's Net Investment Hedge Contracts in 2023 (Level 2 classification) indicates a significant liability position in these instruments, consistent with the 2022 disclosure that Level 2 assets and liabilities include net investment hedge contracts valued using observable market inputs. In 2022, MDLZ detailed that Level 2 financial assets and liabilities consist of instruments like OTC currency exchange forwards, commodity forwards, and net investment hedge contracts, with valuation methodologies based on observable market data. The 2023 data builds on this by showing a material net liability in this category, suggesting either increased hedging activity or unfavorable market movements affecting contract valuations. This evolution highlights how MDLZ's exposure through Level 2 financial assets/liabilities, particularly in net investment hedge contracts, has become more pronounced in 2023 compared to the valuation framework outlined in 2022.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MO faced FCTC-driven regulatory pressure that called for substantial restrictions on marketing of tobacco products, including reduced-risk products (RRPs), which were subject to strict FDA marketing requirements. MO emphasized science-based regulatory frameworks and tax differentiation strategies to support RRP commercialization. By 2024, MO encountered expanded marketing restrictions in the U.S., including limitations on digital communications with adult consumers and bans on vaping in public places. In response, MO adapted by focusing on differentiated marketing strategies, engaging in legislative advocacy, and managing illicit trade risks to protect its RRPs' market position. The company also faced increased scrutiny and settlements related to its former JUUL investment, which influenced its regulatory and marketing posture.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nmanufacturers. The cost of the FDA user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to FDA user fees and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares, all as prescribed by the FSPTCA and FDA regulations. Payments for user fees are adjusted for several factors, including market share and industry volume. For a discussion of the impact of the FDA user fee payments on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below. In addition, compliance with the FSPTCA's regulatory requirements has resulted, and will continue to result, in additional costs for Altria's tobacco operating companies. The amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year to date period but could become material, either individually or in the aggregate, to one or more of Altria's tobacco subsidiaries.\n\n- Investigation and Enforcement: The FDA has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it, including document requests and other required information submissions, facility inspections, examinations and investigations, injunction proceedings, monetary penalties, product withdrawal and recall orders, and product seizures. Investigations or enforcement actions could result in significant costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the business of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\n## Excise Taxes\n\nTobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the United States. Significant increases in tobacco-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted (including with respect to e-vapor products) and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal, state and local levels within the United States. The frequency and magnitude of excise tax increases can be influenced by various factors, including the composition of executive and legislative bodies.\n\nDuring 2021, Congress considered legislation that would have significantly increased the federal excise tax for all tobacco products and created a new tax for e-vapor products and other products containing nicotine that are not currently subject to a tobacco federal excise tax ('novel tobacco products'). The U.S. House of Representatives removed the proposal to increase the federal excise tax on tobacco products currently subject to the tax from the legislation it was considering, but retained the proposed nicotine tax for novel tobacco products. The U.S. Senate debated the legislation and removed the nicotine tax for novel tobacco products; however, as of February 22, 2022, the legislation is still pending before the Senate and could be subject to further tax related amendments.\n\nFederal, state and local cigarette excise taxes have increased substantially over the past two decades, far outpacing the rate of inflation. Between the end of 1998 and February 22, 2022, the weighted-average state cigarette excise tax increased from $0.36 to $1.89 per pack. As of February 22, 2022, no state has enacted new legislation increasing cigarette excise taxes in 2022, but various increases are under consideration or have been proposed.\n\nA majority of states currently tax MST using an ad valorem method, which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product, typically the wholesale price. This ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lower-priced products of equal weight. Altria supports legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on MST to a weight-based methodology because, unlike the ad valorem tax, a weight-based tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax. As of February 22, 2022, the federal government, 23 states, Puerto Rico, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Cook County, Illinois have adopted a weight-based tax methodology for MST.\n\nAn increasing number of states and localities also are imposing excise taxes on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouches. As of February 22, 2022, 30 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and a number of cities and counties have enacted legislation to tax e-vapor products. These taxes are calculated in varying ways and may differ based on the e-vapor product form. Similarly, 11 states and the District of Columbia have enacted legislation to tax oral nicotine pouches.\n\nTax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on product sales of Altria's tobacco operating companies and JUUL through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the non-premium or discount segments, to lower taxed tobacco products, or to counterfeit and contraband products. Lower sales volume and reported share performance of Altria's tobacco operating companies' and investees' products could have a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated financial position or earnings. In addition, substantial excise tax increases on e-vapor and oral nicotine products, may negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\n## International Treaty on Tobacco Control\n\nThe World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the 'FCTC') entered into force in February 2005. As of February 22, 2022, 181 countries, as well as the European Union, have become parties to the FCTC. While the United States is a signatory of the FCTC, it is not currently a party to the agreement, as the agreement has not been submitted to, or ratified by, the U.S. Senate. The FCTC is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. The treaty recommends (and in certain instances, requires) signatory nations to enact legislation that would address various tobacco-related issues.\n\nThere are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the FCTC, some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of tobacco products. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these",

          "chunk_text": "If  nonetheless there is a significant usage of our products or competitive products among youth or non-smokers, even in situations over which  we  have  no  control,  our  credibility  may  suffer,  and  our  efforts  to  advocate  for  the  development  of  science-based  regulatory frameworks for the commercialization of RRPs may be significantly impacted.\n\nMoreover, the FDA's premarket tobacco product and modified risk tobacco product authorizations of a version of our Platform 1 product are subject to strict marketing, reporting and other requirements. Although we have received these product authorizations from the FDA, there is  no  guarantee that the product will remain authorized for sale in the U.S., particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or nonsmoker initiation.\n\n## The financial and business performance of our reduced-risk products is less predictable than our cigarette business.\n\nOur RRPs are novel products in a new category, and the pace at which adult smokers adopt them may vary, depending on the competitive, regulatory, fiscal and cultural environment, and other factors in a specific market. There may be periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for these products, the timing and drivers of which may be more difficult for us to predict versus our mature cigarette business. The impact of this lower predictability on our projected results for a specific period may be significant, particularly during the early  stages  of  this  new  product  category,  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  as  a  result  of  unpredictability  due  to  shortage  of  key components in our supply chain.\n\n## We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to differentiate reduced-risk products and cigarettes with respect to taxation.\n\nTo date, we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our RRPs are not cigarettes due to the absence of combustion, and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products, which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes. Nevertheless, we are unable to predict whether regulators will be issuing new regulations where RRP will be equally taxed  in  line  with  other  tobacco  products  such  as  ordinary  cigarettes.  However,  if  we  cease  to  be  successful  in  these  efforts,  RRP  unit margins may be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Consumption of tax-paid cigarettes continues to decline in many of our markets.\n\nThis decline is due to multiple factors, including increased taxes and pricing, governmental actions, the diminishing social acceptance of smoking  and  health  concerns,  competition,  continuing  economic  and  geopolitical  uncertainty,  and  the  continuing  prevalence  of  illicit products. These factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in Item 7, Business Environment . A continuous decline in the consumption of cigarettes could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\n\n## Cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. Significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. These tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors.\n\nTax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other combustible  tobacco  products,  or  disproportionately  affect  the  relative  retail  price  of  our  cigarette  brands  versus  cigarette  brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. Because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium-price cigarette category, tax regimes based  on  sales  price  can  place  us  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  in  certain  markets.  Furthermore,  our  volume  and  profitability  may  be adversely affected in these markets.\n\nIn addition, increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other combustible tobacco products and from the premium-price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products, or to illicit products such as contraband, counterfeit and \"illicit whites.\"\n\n## Our  business  faces  significant  governmental  action  aimed  at  increasing  regulatory  requirements  with  the  goal  of  reducing  or preventing the use of tobacco products.\n\nGovernmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volumes for our products in many of our markets, and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels  and  will  increase  down-trading  and  the  risk  of  counterfeiting,  contraband,  \"illicit  whites\"  and  legal  cross-border  purchases. Significant regulatory developments will continue to take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the \"FCTC\"). Since it came into force in 2005, the FCTC has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the  marketing  and  sale  of  tobacco  products  to  adult  smokers.  Regulatory  initiatives  that  have  been  proposed,  introduced  or  enacted  by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions include:\n\n- restrictions on or licensing of outlets permitted to sell cigarettes;\n- the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;",

Scientific determinations as to any health risks or negative health consequences associated with the use of e-vapor and other innovative tobacco products could materially adversely affect our innovative tobacco products businesses and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nMost jurisdictions within the United States have restricted smoking in public places and some have restricted vaping in public places. Some public health groups have called for, and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed, bans on smoking and vaping in outdoor places, in private apartments and in cars transporting children.\n\n- Other Legislation or Governmental Initiatives: In addition to the actions discussed above, other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions. For ex ample, in recent years, legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards; establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities; restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes; prohibit the sale of tobacco products based on environmental concerns; impose responsibility on manufacturers for the disposal, recycling or other treatment of post-consumer goods such as plastic packaging; require tax stamping of smokeless tobacco products; require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology; and further restrict the sale, marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds, which may or may not be successful. In addition, if a pandemic or similar health emergency occurs, state and local governments may reimpose additional health and safety requirements for all businesses, which could result in the potential temporary closure of certain businesses and facilities. It is possible that tobacco manufacturing and other facilities and the facilities of our suppliers, our suppliers' suppliers and our trade partners could be subject to additional government-mandated temporary closures and restrictions.\n\nIt is not possible to predict what, if any, additional legislation, regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented (and, if challenged, upheld) relating to the manufacturing, design, packaging, marketing, advertising, sale or use of tobacco products, or the tobacco industry generally. Any such legislation, regulation or other governmental action could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n- Governmental Investigations: From time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. For example, we currently are, or recently have been, subject to a number of governmental investigations with respect to our former investment in JUUL, which we divested in March 2023, including the following: (i) the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') issued a Civil Investigative Demand to us while conducting its antitrust review of our former investment in JUUL; (ii) the SEC commenced an investigation relating to our acquisition, disclosures and accounting controls in connection with the JUUL investment; and (iii) the New York State Office of the Attorney General and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General, separately, issued independent subpoenas to us seeking documents relating to our former investment in and provision of services to JUUL. For a discussion of our disposition of our former investment in JUUL, see Note 8.\n\nIn April 2023, January 2024, February 2024 and April 2024, we agreed to settle the lawsuits relating to our former investment in JUUL initiated by the attorneys general of Minnesota, Alaska, Hawaii and New Mexico, respectively.\n\n## Private Sector Activity on Tobacco Products\n\nA number of retailers, including national chains, have discontinued the sale of all tobacco products, and others have discontinued the sale of e-vapor products. Reasons for the discontinuation include change in corporate policy and, with respect to e-vapor products, reported illnesses and the uncertain regulatory environment. Furthermore, third-party digital platforms, such as app stores, have restricted, and in some cases prohibited, communications with adult tobacco consumers concerning tobacco products. It is possible that if this private sector activity becomes more widespread it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products\n\nIllicit trade in tobacco products has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our businesses, including the sales volumes and market shares of our operating companies' innovative and smoke-free products and traditional tobacco products. Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products that do not comply with the FSPTCA and FDA regulations; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untax ed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit disposable e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products may be designed to appeal to youth and are manufactured without scientific standards, exposing consumers to undocumented risks. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment we have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes, imposing",

      "answer": "In 2023, PM disclosed that RSU awards did not carry voting rights but earned dividend equivalents, with $160 million of total unrecognized compensation costs expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of seventeen months. By 2024, PM shifted focus to PSU awards, which also did not carry voting rights but introduced performance-based vesting tied to Total Shareholder Return (TSR), adjusted diluted EPS growth, and a Sustainability Index. This evolution suggests a strategic shift from time-based equity compensation (RSUs) to performance-based incentives (PSUs) to align executive rewards more closely with long-term strategic goals, including sustainability and financial performance. The consistent absence of voting rights in both award types indicates a deliberate governance design to separate economic incentives from voting control.",

The  PSU  awards  require  the achievement of certain performance metrics, which are predetermined at the time of grant, typically over a three-year performance cycle. The performance metrics for such PSU's granted during 2023 and 2022 consisted of PMI's Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") relative to a predetermined peer group and on an absolute basis (40% weight), PMI's currency-neutral compound annual adjusted diluted earnings per share growth rate (30% weight), and a Sustainability Index, which consists of two drivers:\n\n- Product Sustainability (20% weight) measuring progress primarily on PMI's efforts to maximize the benefits of smoke-free products, purposefully phase out cigarettes, and reduce post-consumer waste; and\n- Operational Sustainability (10% weight) measuring progress on PMI's efforts to benefit PMI and its stakeholders by tackling climate change, preserving nature, improving the quality of life of people in its supply chain, and fostering an empowered, and inclusive workplace.\n\nThe performance metrics, targets and relative weights for the PSU's granted during 2024 were the same as the PSU's granted during 2023 and 2022, with the exception of adjustments made to certain components of the Sustainability Index intended to address PMI's developing sustainability strategy and reporting.\n\nThe PSU performance metrics may be adjusted if appropriate to reflect the impact of unusual or infrequently occurring events, including, to the extent significant, corporate transactions, accounting or tax law changes, asset write-downs, litigation or claim adjustments, foreign exchange gains and losses, unbudgeted capital expenditures and other such events.\n\nThe aggregate of the weighted performance factors for the three metrics in each such PSU award determines the percentage of PSUs that will vest at the end of the three-year performance cycle. The minimum percentage of such PSUs that can vest is zero, with a target percentage of 100 and a maximum percentage of 200. Each such vested PSU entitles the participant to one share of common stock. An aggregate weighted PSU performance factor of 100 will result in the targeted number of PSUs being vested. At the end of the performance cycle, participants are entitled to an amount equivalent to the accumulated dividends paid on common stock during the performance cycle for the number of shares earned.

      "answer": "In 2022, Altria had no recorded liability for the indemnification obligations between PM USA and PMI, as the fair value was considered insignificant. The indemnification framework under the Distribution Agreement remained in place, where PMI indemnifies Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured by PM USA for PMI. In 2023, this structure remained unchanged, with Altria still not recording a liability for the indemnification, indicating that the company's risk allocation strategy for tobacco-related liabilities through PM USA and PMI remained stable. However, the continued absence of a recorded liability suggests that Altria assessed the risk of significant indemnification claims from PMI as low, maintaining a consistent approach to managing contingent liabilities through contractual indemnifications.",

The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. Other than those amounts, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of any environmental remediation and compliance efforts that subsidiaries of Altria may undertake in the future. In the opinion of management, however, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows.\n\n## Guarantees and Other Similar Matters\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, certain subsidiaries of Altria have agreed to indemnify a limited number of third parties in the event of future litigation. At December 31, 2021, Altria and certain of its subsidiaries (i) had $48 million of unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and (ii) were contingently liable for guarantees related to their own performance, including $19 million for surety bonds recorded on its consolidated balance sheet. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries of Altria issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on Altria's liquidity.\n\nUnder the terms of a distribution agreement between Altria and PMI (the 'Distribution Agreement'), entered into as a result of Altria's 2008 spin-off of its former subsidiary PMI, liabilities concerning tobacco products will be allocated based in substantial part on the manufacturer. PMI will indemnify Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI. Altria does not have a related liability recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 as the fair value of this indemnification is insignificant. PMI has agreed not to seek indemnification with respect to the IQOS patent litigation discussed above under IQOS Litigation, excluding the patent infringement case filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\nPM USA has issued guarantees relating to Altria's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its $3.0 billion Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program.

The Philippines enacted a corporate income tax rate reduction in early 2021, which favorably impacted Coca-Cola\u2019s effective tax rate in 2021 compared to 2020. However, in 2023, Coca-Cola faced a potential incremental tax liability of approximately $16 billion, including $5.8 billion related to the 2007\u20132009 tax years, due to the ongoing application of the Tax Court methodology and the correlative adjustments under the Tax Reform Act.

      "answer": "In 2023, MDLZ's VAR model estimated a maximum one-day loss of $284 million under normal market conditions, using a 95% confidence interval and a variance/co-variance technique that excluded forecasted transactions. By 2024, this VAR exposure decreased to $255 million, attributed to reduced interest rate volatility. Despite this decline in VAR, the company reported a significant increase in the notional value of forecasted transactions hedged through foreign exchange contracts, rising from $2 million in 2023 to $106 million in 2024. This suggests that while overall market risk (as measured by VAR) decreased, MDLZ expanded its hedging activities on forecasted transactions, potentially to mitigate residual or non-modeled risks not captured in the VAR framework.

While various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation, the Company's computations are based on a variance/co-variance technique, which assesses the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company's debt, interest rate and foreign exchange, and commodities derivatives, and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level.\n\nThe VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.\n\nVAR on a combined basis decreased to $255 million at September 28, 2024 from $284 million at September 30, 2023 due to reduced interest rate volatility.\n\nThe estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How has MO's regulatory strategy evolved in response to increasing marketing restrictions and the influence of the FCTC on domestic and international tobacco regulation?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MO faced significant marketing restrictions under the State Settlement Agreements, which limited brand advertising, sponsorships, and youth-targeted promotions. These constraints were compounded by state-level legislative actions, including flavor bans in six states and the District of Columbia, which delayed implementation due to referendums like California\u2019s. By 2023, MO\u2019s strategy shifted toward advocating for science-based regulatory frameworks, particularly for reduced-risk products (RRPs), while emphasizing tax differentiation to maintain favorable margins. The company remained subject to the FCTC\u2019s global influence, which, despite the U.S. not being a party, continued to shape domestic regulatory trends and FDA enforcement priorities. MO actively monitored FCTC proposals that could further restrict tobacco product marketing and distribution, potentially affecting adult smoker transitions to RRPs and impacting its Vision.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MO(2022) \u2192 Marketing Restrictions: MO was constrained by advertising and marketing limitations under the State Settlement Agreements and faced state-level flavor bans, including in California, New York, and Illinois.",
        "Hop 2: Marketing Restrictions \u2192 FCTC: These restrictions were influenced by the FCTC's global push for stricter tobacco control, which inspired domestic legislation and regulatory actions even in non-ratifying countries like the U.S.",
        "Hop 3: FCTC \u2190 MO(2023): By 2023, MO was actively navigating the implications of FCTC-driven regulatory trends, advocating for differentiated tax treatment of RRPs and preparing for potential FDA enforcement actions influenced by the FCTC."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nproposals or the impact of any FCTC actions on legislation or regulation in the U.S., either indirectly or as a result of the U.S. becoming a party to the FCTC, or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence FDA regulation and enforcement.\n\n## State Settlement Agreements\n\nAs discussed in Note 18, during 1997 and 1998, PM USA and other major domestic cigarette manufacturers entered into the State Settlement Agreements. These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2021, the inflation calculation was approximately 7% based on the latest CPI-U data; however, the increase in the annual payments did not have a material impact on Altria's financial position. Altria believes that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022, but does not expect the corresponding increase in annual payments to result in a material financial impact. However, we will continue to monitor conditions related to the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment.\n\nFor a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below and Note 18. The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers' business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). The State Settlement Agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters. In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; limit the industry's ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.\n\nIn November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the 'STMSA') with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC. The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions. USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.\n\n## Other International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity\n\n- International, Federal, State and Local Regulation: Various states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches), such as legislation that (i) prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories, such as e-vapor, (ii) prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors, such as menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, (iii) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings and (iv) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products. The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products. As of February 22, 2022, multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products, and six states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Utah, New York and Illinois) and the District of Columbia have passed such legislation. Some of these states, such as New York, Utah and Illinois, exempt certain products that have received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway.\n\nThe legislation in California bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors, including menthol, mint and wintergreen. Following enactment of the flavor ban in August 2020, several registered California voters filed a referendum against the legislation. In January 2021 the requisite number of registered California voters signed a petition to place the question of whether the legislation should be affirmed or overturned on the next statewide general election ballot, which will likely take place in November 2022, unless a special statewide election is called earlier. As a result, the implementation of the legislation is delayed until after a vote on the referendum occurs.\n\nMassachusetts passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in e-vapor products. Similar legislation is pending in one other state.\n\nRestrictions on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products also have been instituted or proposed internationally.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal, state and local legislation and other governmental action, including through litigation. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL. Such action also could negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.",

          "chunk_text": "If  nonetheless there is a significant usage of our products or competitive products among youth or non-smokers, even in situations over which  we  have  no  control,  our  credibility  may  suffer,  and  our  efforts  to  advocate  for  the  development  of  science-based  regulatory frameworks for the commercialization of RRPs may be significantly impacted.\n\nMoreover, the FDA's premarket tobacco product and modified risk tobacco product authorizations of a version of our Platform 1 product are subject to strict marketing, reporting and other requirements. Although we have received these product authorizations from the FDA, there is  no  guarantee that the product will remain authorized for sale in the U.S., particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or nonsmoker initiation.\n\n## The financial and business performance of our reduced-risk products is less predictable than our cigarette business.\n\nOur RRPs are novel products in a new category, and the pace at which adult smokers adopt them may vary, depending on the competitive, regulatory, fiscal and cultural environment, and other factors in a specific market. There may be periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for these products, the timing and drivers of which may be more difficult for us to predict versus our mature cigarette business. The impact of this lower predictability on our projected results for a specific period may be significant, particularly during the early  stages  of  this  new  product  category,  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  as  a  result  of  unpredictability  due  to  shortage  of  key components in our supply chain.\n\n## We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to differentiate reduced-risk products and cigarettes with respect to taxation.\n\nTo date, we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our RRPs are not cigarettes due to the absence of combustion, and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products, which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes. Nevertheless, we are unable to predict whether regulators will be issuing new regulations where RRP will be equally taxed  in  line  with  other  tobacco  products  such  as  ordinary  cigarettes.  However,  if  we  cease  to  be  successful  in  these  efforts,  RRP  unit margins may be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Consumption of tax-paid cigarettes continues to decline in many of our markets.\n\nThis decline is due to multiple factors, including increased taxes and pricing, governmental actions, the diminishing social acceptance of smoking  and  health  concerns,  competition,  continuing  economic  and  geopolitical  uncertainty,  and  the  continuing  prevalence  of  illicit products. These factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in Item 7, Business Environment . A continuous decline in the consumption of cigarettes could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\n\n## Cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. Significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. These tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors.\n\nTax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other combustible  tobacco  products,  or  disproportionately  affect  the  relative  retail  price  of  our  cigarette  brands  versus  cigarette  brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. Because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium-price cigarette category, tax regimes based  on  sales  price  can  place  us  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  in  certain  markets.  Furthermore,  our  volume  and  profitability  may  be adversely affected in these markets.\n\nIn addition, increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other combustible tobacco products and from the premium-price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products, or to illicit products such as contraband, counterfeit and \"illicit whites.\"\n\n## Our  business  faces  significant  governmental  action  aimed  at  increasing  regulatory  requirements  with  the  goal  of  reducing  or preventing the use of tobacco products.\n\nGovernmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volumes for our products in many of our markets, and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels  and  will  increase  down-trading  and  the  risk  of  counterfeiting,  contraband,  \"illicit  whites\"  and  legal  cross-border  purchases. Significant regulatory developments will continue to take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the \"FCTC\"). Since it came into force in 2005, the FCTC has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the  marketing  and  sale  of  tobacco  products  to  adult  smokers.  Regulatory  initiatives  that  have  been  proposed,  introduced  or  enacted  by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions include:\n\n- restrictions on or licensing of outlets permitted to sell cigarettes;\n- the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;",

      "question": "How did PEP's shift in real estate commingled fund investments from 2023 to 2024 affect the allocation between U.S. and international plan assets, particularly regarding net asset value exposures?",
      "answer": "In 2023, PEP's U.S. plan assets included $411 million in real estate commingled funds measured at net asset value, while international plan assets held $162 million in similar funds. By 2024, the U.S. plan assets increased their real estate commingled fund exposure to $561 million, reflecting a $150 million increase, while international plan assets saw a significant decline to $79 million from $162 million. This indicates a strategic reallocation from international to U.S. real estate investments, particularly in assets measured at net asset value. The shift suggests a refocusing of real estate exposure toward domestic markets, aligning with broader pension fund management adjustments between the years.",

        "Hop 2: Real Estate Commingled Funds \u2192 International Plan Assets: The 2023 asset breakdown shows that real estate commingled funds were a distinct component of both U.S. and international plan assets, with specific exposure to net asset value-based valuations.",

      "question": "How did the turnaround in KO's Water, Sports, Coffee and Tea segment in EMEA\u2014from a 2% decline in 2023 to 4% growth in 2024\u2014impact the company's refranchising strategy and regional operating income dynamics in Bottling Investments?",
      "answer": "In 2023, KO's Water, Sports, Coffee and Tea segment negatively impacted EMEA, contributing to a 2% overall decline in unit case volume in the region. This underperformance was compounded by structural changes, including the refranchising of operations in Vietnam and Cambodia, which led to a 1% decrease in Bottling Investments' unit case volume. By 2024, the Water, Sports, Coffee and Tea segment reversed course with a 4% growth in EMEA, contributing to stable unit case volume in the region. Despite this product-line recovery, KO continued its refranchising trend, divesting operations in the Philippines, Bangladesh, and parts of India, which led to a significant 23% drop in Bottling Investments' unit case volume. Meanwhile, EMEA's improved performance in 2024, combined with foreign currency headwinds (-$66M), contributed to a reduction in KO's total assets in the region from $1,153M to $1,087M, indicating a strategic shift toward optimizing regional exposure through asset-light models despite product-level gains.",

        "Hop 1: KO(2023) \u2192 Water,Sports,Coffee and Tea: The segment experienced a 2% decline in EMEA, contributing to negative regional volume performance.",
        "Hop 2: Water,Sports,Coffee and Tea \u2192 EMEA: The product category's performance directly influenced regional volume dynamics and operational strategy.",
        "Hop 3: EMEA \u2190 KO(2024): In 2024, the same product category rebounded with 4% growth in EMEA, yet KO continued refranchising, significantly reducing Bottling Investments' volume by 23%."

Unit case volume in sparkling flavors was even.

Unit case volume in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages was even. The operating segment reported growth in unit case volume of 7% in the India and Southwest Asia operating unit and 4% in both the ASEAN and South Pacific and the Japan and South Korea operating units, partially offset by a decline of 5% in the G reater China and Mongolia operating unit.\n\nUnit case volume for Global Ventures increased 2%, driven by growth in energy drinks, partially offset by a 6% decline in water, sports, coffee and tea. Unit case volume in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages was even.\n\nUnit case volume for Bottling Investments decreased 23%, which primarily reflects the impact of refranchising our bottling operations in the Philippines, Bangladesh and certain territories in India.\n\n## Concentrate Sales Volume\n\nIn 2024, worldwide concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 1% compared to 2023. The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for the operating segments were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals.",

      "question": "How did the strategic importance of the Cheese & Grocery category in the AMEA region evolve for MDLZ from 2022 to 2023, based on both revenue contribution and continued operational focus?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ generated $437 million in revenue from Cheese & Grocery in the AMEA region, which accounted for 1.7% of total net revenues globally. This highlights a modest but present role for the category in that region. By 2023, MDLZ continued to explicitly list Cheese & Grocery as a core product category in its segment reporting, and maintained AMEA as a distinct operating segment, signaling ongoing strategic commitment to this category in the region despite its relatively small revenue share. This indicates that the company preserved its operational structure and product focus in AMEA, even if the Cheese & Grocery category did not show significant growth or emphasis during the transition from 2022 to 2023.",

By 2024, the company maintained the same composition of Level 1 Financial Assets, specifically exchange-traded commodity futures and listed options, and continued to rely on quoted market prices for valuation, showing a consistent approach to managing commodity price risk.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe use a combination of primarily currency forward contracts, futures, options and swaps; commodity forward contracts, futures and options; and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our asset derivatives is recorded within other current assets and other assets and the fair value of our liability derivatives is recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Non-cash changes in unrealized gains and losses related to our unsettled derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items, net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated, and those that are economic hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Currency movements related to our non-U.S. debt and our net investments in non-U.S. operations, as well as the related deferred taxes, are recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.\n\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.\n\nCommodity derivatives . We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nCurrency exchange derivatives . We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. Any unrealized gains or losses (mark-to-market impacts)",

Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our bifurcated exchange options are valued, as derivative instrument liabilities, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related to the market price of the underlying note and associated credit spread combined with the share of price, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility of the JDE Peet's shares over the life of the option. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts.

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ's Gum & Candy segment contributed $861 million to AMEA's total net revenues, representing 2.8% of AMEA's overall revenue. By 2024, AMEA was formally recognized as a distinct operational region, indicating a strategic elevation of the region's importance. This shift suggests that MDLZ likely placed greater emphasis on AMEA's potential for growth and market development, especially for product categories like Gum & Candy that had previously shown moderate revenue contribution. The formalization of AMEA's operational role implies a strategic pivot to capitalize on regional scale and market opportunities, building on earlier contributions from Gum & Candy.",

      "question": "What strategic shifts in PepsiCo's financing approach through borrowing subsidiaries are indicated by the evolution of its Five-Year Credit Agreement capacity from 2022 to 2024, and how might this impact its flexibility for future investments or debt management?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PepsiCo significantly increased the borrowing capacity under its Five-Year Credit Agreement, from $3.75 billion to $5.0 billion, with an option to increase further to $5.75 billion. This expansion, combined with the ability to renew the agreement up to two times for additional one-year periods, suggests a strategic move to enhance financial flexibility. The involvement of borrowing subsidiaries, as seen in both years, indicates a continued reliance on a multi-tiered financing structure to support global operations and general corporate purposes. This increased capacity likely improves PepsiCo's ability to manage short-term liquidity needs, fund strategic investments, or refinance existing debt under more favorable terms, reflecting a proactive stance in preparing for market volatility or expansion opportunities.",

      "question": "How did Altria's reliance on PM USA's financial guarantees in 2023 compare to its indemnification obligations with PMI in 2022, and what does this imply about the company's risk exposure management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Altria had an indemnification agreement with PMI under which PMI would cover liabilities related to certain tobacco products, but Altria noted that the fair value of this indemnification was insignificant and no liability was recorded on its balance sheet. Meanwhile, PM USA, a subsidiary, continued to guarantee Altria's obligations under its debt securities and credit agreements. In 2023, Altria issued $1.0 billion in new senior unsecured notes and again relied on PM USA to guarantee these obligations, reinforcing the central role PM USA played in Altria's financial structure. Despite the unchanged indemnification arrangement with PMI, Altria's continued reliance on PM USA\u2019s guarantees in 2023 suggests a strategic preference to leverage internal guarantees over external indemnifications for managing financial risk.",

      "answer": "In 2023, MO owned a 75% economic interest in Horizon, while JTIUH held the remaining 25%. JTIUH's $50 million non-cash contribution to Horizon in 2023 strengthened the joint venture's capital structure, potentially enhancing its operational capacity. By 2024, Horizon was described as a 'majority-owned joint venture' under MO's portfolio, indicating that MO maintained strategic control despite JTIUH's significant financial input. This suggests that the contribution did not dilute MO's majority stake but instead bolstered the joint venture's financial foundation, supporting MO's long-term strategy in the HTS market.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ excluded forecasted transactions from its VAR model, which estimated a maximum potential one-day loss of $284 million at the end of fiscal 2022. By 2023, the company updated its methodology, applying a parametric delta-gamma approximation technique that considered interest rates, currency exchange, and commodity price movements over the prior quarter. This change in modeling approach, combined with reduced interest rate volatility, led to a decrease in VAR to $255 million by December 31, 2023. The updated model also more explicitly accounted for the non-linear behavior of currency and commodity options, which had not been fully integrated in the 2022 approach. This evolution in modeling suggests a more refined approach to capturing risk in foreign exchange and commodity instruments, aligning with observed market dynamics.",

      "answer": "PEP reduced its allocation to Real Estate Commingled Funds within international plan assets from $221 million in 2022 to $162 million in 2023, a decline of $59 million. This decrease coincided with a broader reallocation of international plan assets, most notably a significant increase in government securities, which rose from $736 million in 2022 to $1,207 million in 2023\u2014an increase of $471 million. This suggests a strategic shift toward more liquid or stable fixed-income investments at the expense of real estate exposure, potentially reflecting a more conservative posture or liquidity management objective in PEP's international pension portfolio.",

      "question": "How has Altria's contingent liability exposure evolved regarding e-vapor products like NJOY ACE compared to traditional tobacco products, given its indemnification agreements with PMI and PM USA, particularly in light of the $125 million impairment risk tied to regulatory uncertainties in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Altria's indemnification framework with PMI and PM USA allocated liabilities based on product manufacturing: PMI indemnified Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to PMI-manufactured tobacco products, and PM USA did the same for products it manufactured, excluding those made for PMI. This arrangement was designed to isolate liability exposure based on product origin. However, by 2024, Altria disclosed a $125 million impairment risk tied to the e-vapor reporting unit, specifically linked to regulatory uncertainties around products like NJOY ACE, including the timing and receipt of FDA authorizations and the ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Since e-vapor products fall outside the historical indemnification structure established for traditional tobacco products, Altria faces a new layer of contingent liability exposure that is not mitigated by its agreements with PMI or PM USA. This represents a meaningful shift in risk profile from 2022 to 2024, as newer product categories expose Altria to unmitigated regulatory and litigation risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MO](2022) \u2192 [PMI]: Altria had an indemnification agreement with PMI where liabilities for tobacco products were allocated based on the manufacturer.",

Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

      "answer": "The 2010 WTO panel decision concluded that Thailand had no basis to claim that PM Thailand under-declared customs values, obligating Thailand to revise its laws affecting cigarette imports. However, Thailand has not fully complied with the decision, and the dispute with the Philippines remains unresolved. This lack of compliance has allowed Thailand to maintain aggressive customs enforcement practices, which continued to expose PM Thailand to significant tax liabilities. In 2022, PM Thailand faced a case stemming from alleged underpayment of customs duties covering 2000\u20132003, where a fine of THB 130 million (approximately $4 million) was initially imposed and paid in 2020. Although the 2017 Thai customs act limited the potential fines, it also introduced procedural complexities that constrained PM's legal recourse. By 2024, the unresolved WTO dispute continued to influence Thailand\u2019s interpretation of customs law, contributing to ongoing regulatory uncertainty and exposure for PM Thailand. This situation directly links PM\u2019s 2022 tax risk environment to its 2024 exposure, shaped by the unresolved WTO decision and the 2017 customs act.",

          "chunk_text": "The DSI also conducted an investigation into alleged underpayment by PM Thailand of customs duties and excise taxes relating to imports from  Indonesia  covering  the  period  2000-2003.  On  January  26,  2017,  the  Public  Prosecutor  filed  charges  against  PM  Thailand  and  its former Thai employee in the Bangkok Criminal Court alleging that PM Thailand and its former employee jointly and with the intention to defraud the Thai government under-declared import prices of cigarettes to avoid full payment of taxes and duties in connection with import entries  during  the  period  from  January  2002  to  July  2003.  The  government  is  seeking  a  fine  of  approximately  THB  19.8  billion (approximately $599 million). In May 2017, Thailand enacted  a new customs act. The new act, which took effect in November 2017, substantially limits the amount of fines that Thailand could seek in these proceedings. PM Thailand believes that its declared import prices are in compliance with the Customs Valuation Agreement of the World Trade Organization and Thai law, and that the allegations of the Public  Prosecutor  are  inconsistent  with  several  decisions  already  taken  by  Thai  Customs  and  a  Thai  court.  Trial  in  the  case  began  in November 2018 and concluded in December 2019. In March 2020, the trial court found our subsidiary guilty of under-declaration of the prices and imposed a fine of approximately THB 130 million (approximately $4 million). The trial court dismissed all charges against the individual defendant. In April 2020, as required by Thai law, our subsidiary paid the fine. This payment is included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements  of  cash  flows  in  the  period  of  payment.  Our  subsidiary  filed  an  appeal  of  the  trial  court's  decision.  In  addition,  the  Public Prosecutor filed an appeal of the trial court's decision challenging the dismissal of charges against the individual defendant and the amount of the fine imposed. If our subsidiary ultimately prevails on appeal, then Thailand will be required to return this payment to our subsidiary.\n\nThe South Korean Board of Audit and Inspection ('BAI') conducted an audit of certain Korean government agencies and the tobacco industry  into  whether  inventory  movements  ahead  of  the  January  1,  2015  increase  of  cigarette-related  taxes  by  tobacco  companies, including  Philip  Morris  Korea  Inc.  (\"PM  Korea\"),  our  South  Korean  subsidiary,  were  in  compliance  with  South  Korean  tax  laws.    In November  2016,  the  tax  authorities  completed  their  audit  and  assessed  allegedly  underpaid  taxes  and  penalties.    In  order  to  avoid nonpayment financial costs, PM Korea paid approximately KRW 272 billion (approximately $227 million), of which KRW 100 billion (approximately  $83  million)  was  paid  in  2016  and  KRW  172  billion  (approximately  $143  million)  was  paid  in  the  first  quarter  of 2017.  These paid amounts are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the period of payment.  PM Korea appealed the assessments. In January 2020, a trial  court  ruled  that  PM  Korea  did  not  underpay  taxes  in  the  amount  of  approximately  KRW  218  billion  (approximately  $182 million). The tax authorities appealed this decision to the appellate court. In September 2020, the appellate court upheld the trial court's decision. The tax authorities have appealed to the Supreme Court of South Korea. In June 2020, another trial court ruled that PM Korea did not underpay approximately KRW 54 billion (approximately $45 million) of alleged underpayments. The government agencies appealed this decision. In January 2021, the appellate court upheld the trial court's decision. The government agencies appealed to the Supreme Court of South Korea. If the tax authorities and government agencies ultimately lose, then they would be required to return the paid amounts to PM Korea.\n\nThe Moscow Tax Inspectorate for Major Taxpayers ('MTI') conducted an audit of AO Philip Morris Izhora ('PM Izhora'), our Russian subsidiary,  for  the  2015-2017  financial  years.  On  July  26,  2019,  MTI  issued  its  initial  assessment,  claiming  that  intercompany  sales  of cigarettes between PM Izhora and another Russian subsidiary prior to excise tax increases and submission by PM Izhora of the maximum retail sales price notifications for cigarettes to the tax authorities were improper under Russian tax laws and resulted in underpayment of excise  taxes  and  V AT.  In  August  2019,  PM  Izhora  submitted  its  objections  disagreeing  with  MTI's  allegations  set  forth  in  the  initial assessment  and  MTI's  methodology  for  calculating  the  alleged  underpayments.  MTI  accepted  some  of  PM  Izhora's  arguments,  and  in September 2019, issued the final tax assessment claiming an underpayment of RUB $24.3 billion (approximately $374 million), including penalties and interest. In accordance with Russian tax laws, PM Izhora paid the entire amount of MTI's final assessment. This amount was neither imposed on, nor concurrent with, the specific revenue-producing transaction, nor was it collected from customers of our Russian subsidiaries. In the third quarter of 2019, PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $374 million, in marketing, administration and research costs in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings, representing $315 million net of an associated income tax benefit of $59 million.\n\nThe  Saudi Arabia  Customs  General Authority  issued  its  assessments  requiring  our  distributors  to  pay  additional  customs  duties  in  the amount of approximately 1.5 billion Saudi Riyal, or approximately $396 million, in relation to the fees paid by these distributors under their agreements with our subsidiary for exclusive rights to distribute our products in Saudi Arabia. In order to challenge these assessments, the distributors  posted  bank  guarantees. To  enable  the  distributors'  challenge,  our  subsidiary  agreed  with  the  banks  to  bear  a  portion  of  the amount the authority may draw on the bank guarantees. In September and October 2020, respectively, the distributors lost their challenges of the assessments. Both distributors appealed, and in June 2021, the Customs Appeal Committee in Riyadh notified the distributors of its decisions to largely reject their appeals. On the basis of the above-mentioned decisions, in June 2021, PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $246 million in relation to the period of 2014 through 2020 in line with existing and contemplated arrangements with the distributors. The estimated amounts for 2021 are immaterial. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the charge was recorded as a reduction in net revenues on the consolidated  statements  of  earnings  for  the  three  months  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2021.  Despite  the  unfavorable  decisions,  our subsidiary believes that customs duties paid in Saudi Arabia were in compliance with the applicable law and the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement.",

We describe certain pending matters in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies .\n\nIn November 2010, a World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") panel issued its decision in a dispute between the Philippines and Thailand, concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\") into Thailand. The decision concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the Thai government and created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports.  Thailand agreed to fully comply with the decision, but the Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision and commenced challenges at the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO Appellate Body is not operational, and the appeals by Thailand are suspended indefinitely. In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues and the countries have since agreed to seek the establishment of a bilateral consultative mechanism, with the goal of reaching a comprehensive settlement of their dispute, consistent with their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreements, as well as the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families in the country. We continue commercial activities in select locations where safety allows, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and supplies the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement. Production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended. On June 20, 2023, we announced the investment of $30 million in a new production facility in the Lviv region, in Western Ukraine. Preparatory work for the facility began in July 2023. The new production facility was completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and local production commenced in April 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our Ukrainian operations had approximately $0.6 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances.\n\nIn Russia, we are continuously assessing the evolving situation in the country. This includes regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. As of December 31, 2024, our Russian operations had approximately $2.7 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $1.0 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles).\n\nAdditionally, we hold a 23% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution B.V ., which was the holding company of JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), pursuant to Dutch law, PMI's distributor in Russia. On July 18, 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Trade filed a petition before the Arbitrazh Court of Moscow seeking the forced localization of JSC TK Megapolis. On December 5, 2024, JSC TK Megapolis registered the transfer of this equity interest to PMI affiliate ZAO Philip Morris Izhora. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6.

Risk Factors , Item 8, Note 4. War in Ukraine and the \"Trade Policy \" section of this Item 7.\n\n## Impact of Inflation on Our Business and Mitigation E fforts\n\nLike many other global companies, we have experienced inflationary pressures in 2022, 2023 and 2024, including: growing pressures on the cost of certain direct materials, wages, energy, transportation, and logistics as well as an increased cost of capital due to interest rate increases driven by the response to increased inflation. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact on cost of sales was approximately $580 million. In 2024, the impact on cost of sales was approximately 30% of the 2023 level, benefiting from lower prices for direct materials and utilities, despite continued pressure on tobacco leaf costs. In 2025, we expect certain inflationary elements such as direct materials and utilities to stabilize, with a moderate overall increase in inflationary pressures driven by tobacco leaf costs.\n\nInflationary impacts driven by higher wages have resulted from merit increases that reflect local inflation as we continuously evaluate our compensation and benefit offerings to be competitive with the current market. Increased transportation costs resulted from increased shipping rates for all modes of transportation (air, ocean and inland) due to ocean and air capacity constraints. Increases in",

We describe certain pending matters in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies .\n\nIn November 2010, a World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") panel issued its decision in a dispute between the Philippines and Thailand, concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\") into Thailand. The decision concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the Thai government and created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports.  Thailand agreed to fully comply with the decision, but the Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision and commenced challenges at the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO Appellate Body is not operational, and the appeals by Thailand are suspended indefinitely. In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues and the countries have since agreed to seek the establishment of a bilateral consultative mechanism, with the goal of reaching a comprehensive settlement of their dispute, consistent with their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreements, as well as the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families in the country. We continue commercial activities in select locations where safety allows, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and supplies the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement. Production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended. On June 20, 2023, we announced the investment of $30 million in a new production facility in the Lviv region, in Western Ukraine. Preparatory work for the facility began in July 2023. The new production facility was completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and local production commenced in April 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our Ukrainian operations had approximately $0.6 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances.\n\nIn Russia, we are continuously assessing the evolving situation in the country. This includes regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. As of December 31, 2024, our Russian operations had approximately $2.7 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $1.0 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles).\n\nAdditionally, we hold a 23% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution B.V ., which was the holding company of JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), pursuant to Dutch law, PMI's distributor in Russia. On July 18, 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Trade filed a petition before the Arbitrazh Court of Moscow seeking the forced localization of JSC TK Megapolis. On December 5, 2024, JSC TK Megapolis registered the transfer of this equity interest to PMI affiliate ZAO Philip Morris Izhora. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6.

      "question": "How did the combination of 2023\u20132024 U.S. state-level tobacco restrictions and ongoing FCTC pressures influence MO's inflation-adjusted State Settlement Agreement liabilities and overall regulatory risk exposure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MO faced U.S. state-level legislation including flavor bans in six states and the District of Columbia, which impacted product availability and sales dynamics. The inflation rate used in the State Settlement Agreements was 3.4% in December 2023, contributing to higher annual payment obligations. MO noted that while the increase was not material, it anticipated continued inflationary pressure in 2024. Meanwhile, the FCTC, with 182 parties as of early 2024, was advancing proposals for stricter tobacco controls, which MO acknowledged could indirectly influence U.S. regulation and enforcement. By 2024, three additional states (Maryland, Colorado, and Rhode Island) had enacted excise tax increases, and the inflation rate for the Settlement Agreements had dropped to 2.9% by December 2024. However, the ongoing FCTC discussions continued to pose regulatory uncertainty. The combination of evolving state-level restrictions and international treaty pressures shaped MO's regulatory risk profile, reinforcing its need to monitor and adapt to both domestic and global regulatory shifts while managing rising compliance and tax burdens.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MO(2023) \u2192 Legislation: MO faced state-level tobacco restrictions in 2023, including flavor bans in six states and D.C., and inflation-adjusted settlement liabilities at a 3.4% rate.",
        "Hop 2: Legislation \u2192 FCTC: U.S. state legislation was influenced by broader global regulatory trends, with the FCTC recommending restrictions that could indirectly shape U.S. policy despite the U.S. not being a party to the treaty.",
        "Hop 3: FCTC \u2190 MO(2024): In 2024, MO continued to operate under the influence of the FCTC\u2019s global agenda, with three additional states increasing excise taxes and the inflation adjustment dropping slightly to 2.9%, yet still contributing to regulatory uncertainty."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nregulatory requirements, even inadvertently, and FDA enforcement actions also could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n- Investigation and E nforcement: The FDA has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it, including document requests and other required information submissions, facility inspections, facility closures, ex aminations and investigations, injunction proceedings, monetary penalties, product withdrawal and recall orders, and product seizures. Investigations or enforcement actions could result in significant costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Excise Taxes\n\nTobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the United States. Significant increases in tobacco-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted (including with respect to e-vapor products) and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal, state and local levels within the United States. The frequency and magnitude of excise tax increases can be influenced by various factors, including the composition of executive and legislative bodies.\n\nFederal, state and local cigarette ex cise tax es have increased substantially over the past two decades, far outpacing the rate of inflation. Between the end of 1998 and February 24, 2025, the weighted-average state cigarette excise tax increased from $0.36 to $1.93 per pack. Three states (Maryland, Colorado and Rhode Island) increased excise taxes in 2024. As of February 24, 2025, no states have increased excise taxes in 2025. However, various increases are under consideration or have been proposed.\n\nA majority of states currently tax  MST using an ad valorem method, which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product, typically the wholesale price. This ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lower-priced products of equal weight. We support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on MST to a weight-based methodology because, unlike the ad valorem tax, a weight-based tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax. As of February 24, 2025, the federal government, 23 states, Puerto Rico, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Cook County, Illinois have adopted a weight-based tax methodology for MST. North Carolina has passed legislation that will cause the state to adopt a weight-based tax methodology for MST in July 2025.\n\nAn increasing number of states and localities also are imposing excise taxes on e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches. As of February 24, 2025, 33 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and a number of cities and counties have enacted legislation to tax e-vapor products. These taxes are calculated in varying ways and may differ based on the e-vapor product form. Similarly, 13 states and the District of Columbia have enacted legislation to tax oral nicotine pouches.\n\nTax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of our operating companies' products through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult tobacco consumer purchases from premium to non-premium or discount cigarettes, to lower taxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products. Lower sales volume and reported share performance of our operating companies' products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In addition, substantial ex cise tax  increases on e-vapor and oral nicotine products may negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could materially adversely affect our innovative tobacco businesses and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\n## International Treaty on Tobacco Control\n\nThe World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the 'FCTC') entered into force in February 2005. As of February 24, 2025, 182 countries, as well as the European Union, have become parties to the FCTC. While the United States is a signatory of the FCTC, it is not currently a party to the agreement, as the agreement has not been submitted to, or ratified by, the U.S. Senate. The FCTC is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. The treaty recommends (and in certain instances, requires) signatory nations to enact legislation that would address various tobacco-related issues.\n\nThere are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the FCTC, some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of tobacco products. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any FCTC actions on legislation or regulation in the United States, either indirectly or as a result of the United States becoming a party to the FCTC, or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence FDA regulation and enforcement.\n\n## State Settlement Agreements\n\nAs discussed in Note 20, during 1997 and 1998, PM USA and other major domestic cigarette manufacturers entered into the State Settlement Agreements. These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2024, the inflation calculation was approximately 2.9% based on the latest CPI-U data. We will continue to monitor the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment and our businesses.",

      "question": "How did CL's use and accounting treatment of interest rate swap contracts as economic hedges evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of fair value disclosures and hedge designation practices?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CL disclosed that its interest rate swap contracts had a total fair value of $25 million in assets (including $5 million in other current assets and $20 million in other assets), with no corresponding liabilities reported. These contracts were described as providing an economic hedge of portions of outstanding debt, a common industry practice also seen at companies like UPS in 2022. By 2024, CL maintained its use of interest rate swaps but expanded its disclosure framework, explicitly stating that certain instruments 'may also economically hedge certain risks but do not qualify for hedge accounting.' This reflects a more nuanced approach where CL continues to use these instruments for economic hedging while maintaining clearer distinctions in its accounting treatment between designated hedges and non-designated economic hedges.",

Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax  rates that will be in effect at the time such differences are ex pected to reverse. Deferred tax  assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax  assets will not be realized.\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive model to recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on an income tax return. The Company recognizes interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within Provision for income taxes.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nDerivative instruments are recorded as assets and liabilities at estimated fair value based on available market information. The Company's derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. For fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative, as well as the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item, are recognized in earnings each period. For cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings when the offsetting effect of the hedged item is also recognized in earnings. For hedges of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. Cash flows related to hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged item in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nThe Company may also enter into certain foreign currency and interest rate instruments that economically hedge certain of its risks but do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in fair value of these derivative instruments, based on quoted market prices, are recognized in earnings each period. The Company's derivative instruments and other financial instruments are more fully described in Note 6, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments along with the related fair value measurement considerations.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units (both performance-based and timevested), based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant over the requisite service period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton ('Black-Scholes') option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. In addition to performance conditions, performance-based restricted stock units also include a total shareholder return modifier. Because the total shareholder return modifier is considered a market condition, the Company uses a Monte-Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units. The fair value of time-vested restricted stock units is determined based on the closing market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant. Stock-based compensation plans, related expenses and assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are more fully described in Note 7, Capital Stock and Stock-Based Compensation Plans.\n\n## Currency Translation\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other than those operating in highly inflationary environments, are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end ex change rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.\n\nFor subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, local currency-denominated non-monetary assets, including inventories, goodwill and property, plant and equipment, are remeasured at their historical ex change rates, while local currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company.",

      "answer": "PepsiCo's APAC segment showed no growth in beverage operating profit contribution between 2023 and 2024, remaining at 23% in both years. This stable contribution, despite PepsiCo's overall beverage segment increasing from 41% to 42% globally in 2024, suggests that the company maintained a neutral stance on beverage investment in APAC. The lack of growth in APAC's beverage contribution, while other regions like AMESA increased from 29% to 30%, indicates a strategic decision to maintain rather than expand beverage operations in APAC during this period.",

(the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results.

      "answer": "In 2022, MO's subsidiary USSTC was actively navigating the FDA's SE report process for Provisional Products and had already discontinued certain smokeless tobacco products that were later found to be not substantially equivalent. By 2024, MO had expanded its regulatory strategy, with Helix submitting PMTAs for on! PLUS oral nicotine pouches in June 2024, and USSTC securing FDA authorization for modified risk claims about its Copenhagen Classic Snuff MST product in March 2023\u2014though it later withdrew that application in February 2025.

Segment Reporting .\n\nIn 2020, a majority of Altria's businesses offered cash discounts to customers for prompt payment and calculated cash discounts as a percentage of the list price based on historical experience and agreed-upon payment terms. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021 for USSTC and in the third quarter of 2021 for PM USA, cash discounts were calculated as a flat rate per unit, based on agreed-upon payment terms. Altria's businesses record receivables net of the cash discounts on Altria's consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAltria's businesses that receive payments in advance of product shipment record such payments as deferred revenue. These payments are included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets until control of such products is obtained by the customer. Deferred revenue was $287 million and $301 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. When cash is received in advance of product shipment, Altria's businesses satisfy their performance obligations within three days of receiving payment. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no differences between amounts recorded as deferred revenue and amounts subsequently recognized as revenue.\n\nReceivables were $47 million and $137 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively; the decrease was due primarily to the Ste. Michelle Transaction. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no expected differences between amounts recorded and subsequently received, and Altria's businesses did not record an allowance for doubtful accounts against these receivables.\n\nAltria's businesses record an allowance for returned goods, which is included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets. While all of Altria's tobacco operating companies sell tobacco products with dates relative to freshness as printed on product packaging, it is USSTC's policy to accept authorized sales returns from its customers for products that have passed such dates due to the limited shelf life of USSTC's MST and snus products. Altria's businesses record estimated sales returns, which are based principally on historical volume and return rates, as a reduction to revenues. Actual sales returns will differ from estimated sales returns to the extent actual results differ from estimated assumptions. Altria's businesses reflect differences between actual and estimated sales returns in the period in which the actual amounts become known. These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements. All returned goods are destroyed upon return and not included in inventory. Consequently, Altria's businesses do not record an asset for their right to recover goods from customers upon return.\n\nSales incentives include variable payments related to goods sold by Altria's businesses. Altria's businesses include estimates of variable consideration as a reduction to revenues upon shipment of goods to customers. The sales incentives that require significant estimates and judgments are as follows:\n\n- Price promotion paymentsAltria's businesses make price promotion payments, substantially all of which are made to their retail partners to incent the promotion of certain product offerings in select geographic areas.\n- Wholesale and retail participation paymentsAltria's businesses make payments to their wholesale and retail partners to incent merchandising and sharing of sales data in accordance with each business's trade agreements.\n\nThese estimates primarily include estimated wholesale to retail sales volume and historical acceptance rates. Actual payments will differ from estimated payments to the extent actual results differ from estimated assumptions. Differences between actual and estimated payments are reflected in the period such information becomes available. These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements.",

Through these processes, a manufacturer could receive (i) a 'not substantially equivalent' determination, (ii) a denial of a PMTA or (iii) a marketing order withdrawal by the FDA on one or more products, which would require the removal of the product or products from the market. Such actions could have a material adverse impact on the business and consolidated results of operations of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\nProvisional Products : Most cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by PM USA and USSTC are 'Provisional Products.' Altria's subsidiaries timely submitted SE reports for these Provisional Products. PM USA and USSTC have received SE determinations on certain Provisional Products. Those products that were found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent (certain smokeless tobacco products) had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA's determinations; therefore, those determinations did not impact business results. PM USA and USSTC have other Provisional Products that continue to be subject to the FDA's pre-market review process. In the meantime, they can continue marketing these products unless the FDA determines that a specific Provisional Product is not substantially equivalent.\n\nIn addition, the FDA has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of Provisional Product SE reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further FDA review. PM USA and USSTC have Provisional Products included in this subset of products.\n\nWhile Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies believe their current Provisional Products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, they cannot predict how the FDA will ultimately apply law, regulation and guidance to their various SE reports. Should Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies receive unfavorable determinations on any SE reports currently pending with the FDA, they believe they can replace the vast majority of their respective product volumes with other FDA authorized products or with Grandfathered Products.\n\nNon-Provisional Products : Cigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after March 22, 2011 are 'Non-Provisional Products' and must receive a marketing order from the FDA prior to being offered for sale. Marketing orders for Non-Provisional Products may be obtained by filing an SE report, PMTA or using another pre-market pathway established by the FDA. Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies may not be able to obtain a marketing order for non-provisional products because the FDA may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval.\n\nProducts Regulated in 2016 : Manufacturers of products first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an SE report or PMTA by the filing deadline of September 9, 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market. These products can remain on the market during FDA review through court-allowed, case-by-case discretion, so long as the report or application was timely filed with the FDA. Due to the large number of applications received by September 9, 2020, the FDA did not complete its review of all submitted applications by September 9, 2021, although it represents that it has made decisions on more than 98% of the applications, with most being marketing denial orders and a few marketing granted orders for tobacco flavor e-vapor products. A number of the marketing denial orders are subject to litigation challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers. For those products still under FDA review, it is uncertain when and for how long the FDA may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its case-by-case discretion. For products (new or modified) not on the market as of August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file an SE report or PMTA and receive FDA authorization prior to marketing and selling the product.\n\nHelix submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020. JUUL submitted PMTAs to the FDA for its e-vapor device and the related tobacco and menthol flavors in July 2020. As of February 22, 2022, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or JUUL products. In addition, as of February 22, 2022, Middleton has received market orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn December 2013, Altria's subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with PMI, including an agreement that grants Altria an exclusive right to commercialize certain of PMI's heated tobacco products in the United States, subject to FDA authorization of the applicable products. PMI submitted a PMTA and a MRTP application with the FDA for its electronically heated tobacco products comprising the IQOS Tobacco Heating System . The IQOS devices heat, but do not burn tobacco. In April 2019, the FDA authorized the PMTA for the IQOS Tobacco Heating System and in July 2020, the FDA authorized the marketing of this system as a MRTP with a reduced exposure claim. In December 2020, the FDA authorized the PMTA for IQOS 3, an updated version of the IQOS devices. The MRTP authorization for the original IQOS device currently does not apply to the IQOS 3 device. PMI submitted an MRTP application for the IQOS 3 device in March 2021, which is currently under review by the FDA.\n\nIn September 2021, in connection with a patent dispute, the ITC issued a cease and desist order, effective as of November 29, 2021, banning (i) the importation of the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and infringing components into the United States and (ii) the sale, marketing and distribution of such imported products in the United States. As a result, PM USA removed the products from the",

PLUS products.\n\nAs of February 24, 2025, Middleton has received marketing orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn October 2021, the FDA authorized the marketing and sale of four of USSTC's Verve oral nicotine products, including Green Mint and Blue Mint varieties, representing the first flavored product authorizations issued by the FDA for newly deemed innovative products. These products are not currently marketed or sold.\n\nIn March 2023, the FDA authorized USSTC to communicate a modified risk claim about its Copenhagen Classic Snuff MST product. This product is not currently marketed or sold. The authorized claim for Copenhagen Classic Snuff is 'IF YOU SMOKE, CONSIDER THIS: Switching completely to this product from cigarettes reduces risk of lung cancer.' In February 2025, USSTC filed a notice with the FDA withdrawing its modified risk application.\n\nAs a result of our June 2023 acquisition of NJOY Holdings, we gained full global ownership of NJOY's e-vapor product portfolio, including NJOY ACE , a pod-based e-vapor product with an MGO from the FDA, and NJOY DAILY , which also has an MGO. In June 2024, NJOY received MGOs with respect to two NJOY ACE menthol products and two NJOY DAILY menthol products. In May 2024, NJOY submitted a supplemental PMTA to the FDA to commercialize and market the NJOY ACE 2.0 device, which leverages Bluetooth connectivity to incorporate access restriction technology designed to prevent underage use by authenticating the user before unlocking the device. Also in May 2024, NJOY re-submitted PMTAs for blueberry and watermelon flavored pod-based e-vapor products that work exclusively with the Bluetooth -enabled NJOY ACE 2.0 device. These products previously received marketing denial orders ('MDOs') on the basis of FDA concerns regarding underage use. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nPost-Market Surveillance : Manufacturers that receive MGOs must adhere to the FDA post-market record keeping and reporting requirements, as detailed in market orders and in the final PMTA rule. The requirements include prior notification of marketing activities. The FDA may amend requirements of an MGO or withdraw the MGO based on this information if, among other reasons, it determines that the continued marketing of the products is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health.",

      "answer": "In 2023, PM acquired Swedish Match, which brought the ZYN brand\u2014a leading nicotine pouch product\u2014into PM's portfolio, complementing its existing smoke-free offerings like IQOS. By 2024, PM had expanded its nicotine pouch presence from an unspecified number of markets in 2023 to 37 markets globally. This growth reflects the strategic integration of Swedish Match's ZYN into PM's regional business structure, which was completed by early 2024, enabling broader geographic distribution of nicotine pouches under PM's global smoke-free strategy.",

IQOS was  first introduced in Nagoya, Japan, in 2014.\n\nIQOS and ZYN are the leading brands in our SFPs portfolio. As of December 31, 2024, our smoke-free products were available for sale in 95 markets. With regard to nicotine pouches, we increased our presence to 37 markets.\n\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 170 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by Marlboro ,  the  world's  best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 40% of our total 2024 cigarette shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament . Our other leading international cigarette brands are Chesterfield, L&amp;M , and Philip Morris. These five international cigarette brands contributed 80% of our cigarette shipment volume in 2024. We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as Dji  Sam  Soe and Sampoerna  A in  Indonesia,  and Fortune and Jackpot in the Philippines.\n\n## Source of Funds - Dividends\n\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, ex cept to the ex tent that claims of  our  company  itself  as  a  creditor  may  be  recognized. As  a  holding  company,  our  principal  sources  of  funds,  including  funds  to  make  payment  on  our  debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions that are otherwise compliant with law, including governmental capital and foreign currency exchange controls.\n\n## Description of Business\n\nFollowing the combination and the progress in 2023 toward the integration of the Swedish Match business into PMI's existing regional structure, PMI updated in January 2024 its segment reporting by including the former Swedish Match segment results into the four existing geographical segments. Our four geographical segments are as follows:\n\n- Europe Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe;\n- South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA\") is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia;\n- East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU &amp; PMI DF\") is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia &amp; Australia; and\n- Americas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.\n\nOur Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&amp;H\") segment, which includes the operating results of our Wellness and Healthcare business, remained unchanged in 2024.\n\nFollowing the sale of V ectura G roup Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining Wellness &amp; Healthcare results in the Europe segment. In addition, we will be renaming our 'PMI Duty Free' business to 'PMI G lobal Travel Retail' effective in the first quarter of 2025.

      "question": "How did the change in Altria Group's (MO) debt guarantee structure through PM USA in 2022 relate to the evolution of release conditions tied to S&P credit ratings in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Altria Group (MO) relied on PM USA to guarantee its debt obligations, with release conditions including the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt rating by S&P being A or higher. The Guarantees were unconditional and not affected by changes in the debt terms or collateral status. In 2023, the same release condition remained in place, but there was increased emphasis on the potential for guarantees to be voided under bankruptcy or fraudulent transfer laws if PM USA was insolvent or undercapitalized at the time of the guarantee. This suggests that while the formal release condition tied to the S&P rating remained stable, the regulatory scrutiny around the enforceability of guarantees intensified year-over-year, particularly regarding PM USA's financial health at the time of guaranteeing the obligations.",

        "Hop 2: PM USA \u2192 Release Conditions: The guarantees were subject to specific release conditions, including the Parent's S&P credit rating reaching A or higher, among other customary triggers.",
        "Hop 3: Release Conditions \u2190 MO(2023): In 2023, MO disclosed the same release conditions, but with expanded detail on potential voiding of guarantees under bankruptcy or fraudulent transfer laws, indicating heightened regulatory risk."

(the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

By 2024, the fair value of Net Investment Hedge Contracts had reached -$219 million as of December 31, 2023, indicating a significant liability position within Level 2 valuation. This shift suggests a strategic increase or repositioning in the use of net investment hedge contracts, which are typically used to offset foreign exchange risks on long-term investments.

      "answer": "In 2022, PM disclosed that PSU awards did not carry voting rights and were tied to performance metrics such as Total Shareholder Return (TSR), adjusted diluted earnings per share growth, and transformation measures (e.g., RRP revenue as a percentage of total). By 2023, PM continued to emphasize non-voting equity instruments but shifted focus to RSU awards, which also lacked voting rights but were subject to time-based vesting rather than performance conditions. This reflects a strategic move toward more predictable compensation vehicles, as evidenced by the $160 million in unrecognized compensation costs for RSUs as of December 31, 2023, expected to be recognized over approximately seventeen months. The consistent use of non-voting equity awards suggests PM's intent to align long-term incentives without diluting shareholder control.",

The PSU awards require the achievement of certain performance factors, which are predetermined at the time of grant, typically over a three-year performance cycle. The performance metrics for such PSU's granted during 2021 and 2020 consisted of PMI's Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") relative to a predetermined peer group and on an absolute basis (40% weight), PMI's currency-neutral compound annual adjusted diluted earnings per share growth rate (30% weight), and PMI's performance against specific measures of PMI's transformation, defined as net revenues from PMI's RRPs and any other non-combustible products as a percentage of PMI's total net revenues in the last year of the performance  cycle  (30%  weight).  The  performance  metrics  for  such  PSUs  granted  during  2019  consisted  of  PMI's  TSR  relative  to  a predetermined peer group and on an absolute basis (50% weight), PMI's currency-neutral compound annual adjusted operating income growth rate, excluding acquisitions (30% weight), and PMI's performance against specific measures of PMI's transformation (20% weight).\n\nThe aggregate of the weighted performance factors for the three metrics in each such PSU award determines the percentage of PSUs that will  vest  at  the  end  of  the  three-year  performance  cycle.  The  minimum  percentage  of  such  PSUs  that  can  vest  is  zero,  with  a  target percentage of 100 and a maximum percentage of 200. Each such vested PSU entitles the participant to one share of common stock. An aggregate weighted PSU performance factor of 100 will result in the targeted number of PSUs being vested. At the end of the performance cycle, participants are entitled to an amount equivalent to the accumulated dividends paid on common stock during the performance cycle for the number of shares earned. PSU awards do not carry voting rights.\n\nDuring 2021, the activity for PSU awards was as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2019, PM deconsolidated Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH) and began accounting for its continuing investment under ASC 321 as an equity security at fair value, initially estimated at $3,280 million. By 2024, developments in the CCAA proceedings\u2014including the filing of a Proposed Plan proposing a CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement of Canadian tobacco claims\u2014triggered an impairment review. Due to unresolved allocation of the settlement among RBH, ITL, and JTIM, and RBH's objection to the Proposed Plan, PM determined that the fair value of its investment had declined significantly. As a result, PM recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million in 2024, reducing the carrying value of the investment to $714 million. This reflects a direct temporal and financial evolution from the initial deconsolidation in 2019 through the CCAA proceedings to the 2024 impairment decision.",

        "Hop 1: PM(2022) \u2192 Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc.: PM deconsolidated RBH in 2019 and recorded a $239 million loss and $194 million litigation expense related to RBH in prior years.",
        "Hop 2: Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. \u2192 CCAA: RBH sought protection under CCAA in 2019 due to Canadian tobacco litigation liabilities, including a CAD 15.5 billion judgment in the Blais case, leading to a comprehensive stay of litigation.",
        "Hop 3: CCAA \u2190 PM(2024): In 2024, PM evaluated its RBH investment amid the CCAA Proposed Plan calling for a CAD 32.5 billion settlement, leading to a $2,316 million impairment charge and a fair value of $714 million for its RBH investment."

          "chunk_text": "We  and  our  subsidiaries  record  provisions  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  pending  litigation  when  we  determine  that  an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, except as stated otherwise in this Note 17. Contingencies, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, after assessing the information available to it (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIt is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Nevertheless, although litigation is subject to uncertainty, we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. All such cases are,  and  will  continue  to  be,  vigorously  defended.  However, we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so.\n\n## CCAA Proceedings and Stay of Tobacco-Related Cases Pending in Canada\n\nAs a result of the Court of Appeal of Quebec's decision in both the L\u00e9tourneau and Blais cases described below, our subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH'), and the other defendants, JTI Macdonald Corp., and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited, sought protection in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ('CCAA') on March 22, March 8, and March 12, 2019 respectively. CCAA is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course. The initial CCAA order made by the Ontario Superior Court on March 22, 2019 authorizes RBH to pay all expenses incurred  in  carrying  on  its  business  in  the  ordinary  course  after  the  CCAA  filing,  including  obligations  to  employees,  vendors,  and suppliers.  As  further  described  in  Note  20. Deconsolidation  of  RBH ,  RBH's  financial  results  have  been  deconsolidated  from  our consolidated financial statements since March 22, 2019. As part of the CCAA proceedings, there is currently a comprehensive stay up to and including March 31, 2022 of all tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and the other defendants, including PMI and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), namely, the smoking and health class actions filed in various Canadian provinces and health care cost recovery actions. These proceedings are presented below under the caption ' Stayed Litigation - Canada .'  Ernst &amp; Young Inc. has been appointed as monitor of RBH in the CCAA proceedings. In accordance with the CCAA process, as the parties work towards a plan of arrangement or compromise in a confidential mediation, it is anticipated that the court will set additional hearings and further extend the stay of proceedings. On April 17, 2019, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that RBH and the other defendants will not be allowed to file an application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision in the L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases so long as the comprehensive stay of all tobacco-related litigation in Canada remains in effect and that the time period to file the application would be extended by the stay period. While RBH believes that the findings of liability and damages in both L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases were incorrect, the CCAA proceedings will provide a forum for RBH to seek resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada. It is not possible to predict the resolution of the underlying legal proceedings or the length of the CCAA process.\n\nStayed Litigation - Canada\n\n## Smoking and Health Litigation - Canada\n\nIn the first class action pending in Canada, Conseil Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Sur Le Tabac Et La Sant\u00e9 and Jean-Yves Blais v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. and JTI-Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada ,  filed in November 1998, RBH and other Canadian cigarette manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. and JTI-Macdonald Corp.) are defendants. The plaintiffs, an anti-smoking organization and an individual smoker, sought compensatory and punitive damages for each member of the class who suffers allegedly from certain smoking-related diseases. The class was certified in 2005. The trial court issued its judgment on May 27, 2015. The trial court found RBH and two other Canadian manufacturers liable and found that the class members' compensatory damages totaled approximately CAD 15.5 billion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $12.1 billion). The trial court awarded compensatory damages on a joint and several liability basis, allocating 20% to our subsidiary (approximately CAD 3.1 billion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $2.4  billion)).  In  addition,  the  trial  court  awarded  CAD  90,000  (approximately  $70,500)  in  punitive  damages,  allocating  CAD  30,000 (approximately $23,500) to RBH. The trial court estimated the disease class at 99,957 members. RBH appealed to the Court of Appeal of Quebec. In October 2015, the Court of Appeal ordered RBH to furnish security totaling CAD 226 million (approximately $177 million) to cover both the L\u00e9tourneau and Blais cases, which RBH has paid in installments through March 2017. The Court of Appeal ordered Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. to furnish security totaling CAD 758 million (approximately $594 million) in installments through June 2017. JTI Macdonald Corp. was not required to furnish security in accordance with plaintiffs' motion. The Court of Appeal ordered that the security is payable upon a final judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the trial court's judgment or upon further order of the Court of Appeal.",

          "chunk_text": "PMI holds a 49% equity interest in United Arab Emirates-based Emirati Investors-TA (FZC) ('EITA').  PMI holds an approximate 25% economic interest in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Tabacs Alg\u00e9ro-Emiratie ('STAEM'), an Algerian joint venture that is  51% owned by EITA and 49% by the Algerian state-owned enterprise Management et D\u00e9veloppement des Actifs et des Ressources Holding (\"MADAR Holding\"), which manufactures and distributes under license some of PMI's brands (SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA segment).\n\nIn  April  2023,  PMI  acquired  an  approx imate  economic  interest  of 25%  in  United  Tobacco  Company  (\"UTC\").  UTC  is  an  entity  incorporated  in  Egypt  which manufactures products under license for PMI's Egyptian subsidiary. On May 16, 2024, PMI acquired a controlling interest in UTC. For further details, see Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures .\n\nIn May 2024, PMI acquired an indirect economic interest of 14.7% in Eastern Company ('Eastern\"), Egypt's largest cigarette manufacturer which also includes cigars and pipe tobacco, among others, in its portfolio. PMI accounted for its investment in Eastern under the equity method of accounting as it has the indirect ability to participate in Eastern's policy making processes. In relation to the acquisition, PMI subsequently entered into an agreement in August 2024 to guarantee certain credit facilities and repayment of certain bank loan liabilities. The max imum amount of these guarantee obligations is $385 million and they will be in effect until 2034. As of December 31, 2024, PMI has not finalized the basis difference allocation resulting from the investment.\n\nThe initial investments in Megapolis Distribution BV , EITA, Eastern and UTC (up to the acquisition of controlling interest in UTC on May 16, 2024) have been recorded  at  cost  and  are  included  in  equity  investments  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Transactions  between  these  equity  method  investees  and  PMI subsidiaries are considered to be related-party transactions and are included in the tables below.\n\n## Equity securities:\n\nOn March 22, 2019, PMI's wholly owned subsidiary in Canada, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH') obtained an initial order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (\"CCAA\"), which is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees. The administration of the CCAA process, principally relating to the powers provided to the court under the CCAA and the oversight provided by the court appointed monitor, removes certain elements of control of the business from both PMI and RBH. As a result, PMI determined that it no longer had a controlling financial interest over RBH as defined in ASC 810 (Consolidation), and deconsolidated RBH as of the date of the CCAA filing.\n\nSince the deconsolidation of RBH on March 22, 2019, PMI has accounted for its continuing investment in RBH in accordance with ASC 321 (Investments-Equity Securities) as an equity security, without readily determinable fair value, and recorded its continuing investment in RBH at fair value of $3,280 million, which included the estimated settlement amount at the date of deconsolidation, within equity investments.\n\nOn October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement ('Proposed Plan') setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation. Under the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\") and JTI Macdonald Corp (\"JTIM\") would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approximately $22.3 billion). A significant determinative factor in the analysis of impairment indicators was the issue of allocation of CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM which remained unresolved at the time of filing.\n\nThere has been no agreed allocation under the Proposed Plan and there has been no ruling from the CCAA court on the matter. On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the Proposed Plan with the CCAA court (for further details, see Note 18. Contingencies ). Developments, including the positions taken by RBH in this objection and the positions taken by other parties in related filings narrowed the range of possible outcomes with respect to the allocation of the aggregate  settlement  amount  of  CAD 32.5 billion among  RBH,  ITL, and  JTIM, which was determined to be an indicator that PMI's investment in RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the Proposed plan, PMI evaluated its investment in RBH for potential impairment and concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in  RBH was lower than its carrying value. As a result,  PMI performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in RBH as of December 31, 2024, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a recognized subsequent event. The fair value of PMI's continuing investment in RBH of $714 million represented the estimated fair value of the underlying business, net of PMI's best estimate of the share of the aggregate global settlement amount that could be allocated to RBH, and was determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nIn determining the fair value of PMI's investment in RBH, PMI made various judgements, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were the discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the fair value of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada. In addition, significant estimates were made with respect to the allocation amount of the aggregate global",

      "question": "How did the change in FDA regulatory compliance requirements in 2023 affect MO's impairment analysis of its Cronos investment in 2024, particularly in relation to the $125 million hypothetical impairment sensitivity disclosed in the 2024 filings?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MO disclosed that its investment in Cronos was subject to various regulatory risks, including FDA regulations, which could result in criminal, civil, or tax liability and reputational harm if not properly managed. By 2024, MO's impairment analysis for its reporting units and equity investments, including Cronos, became more sensitive to regulatory developments, such as FDA enforcement actions or delays in regulatory authorizations. Specifically, MO noted that a 1% increase in the discount rate used in its impairment model for e-vapor and related assets could result in a $125 million impairment charge, reflecting heightened sensitivity to regulatory uncertainty. This indicates that the evolving FDA compliance landscape in 2023 directly influenced the financial risk modeling and impairment sensitivity of the Cronos investment in 2024.",

Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

      "question": "How did the change in Altria Group's (MO) reliance on PM USA's guarantees between 2022 and 2023 affect the risk of insolvency for PM USA, particularly in relation to the valuation of its assets versus liabilities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Altria Group (MO) relied heavily on PM USA, its 100% owned subsidiary, to guarantee its debt obligations, with PM USA acting as the primary obligor for Altria\u2019s debt securities, credit agreements, and commercial paper programs. These guarantees were unconditional and could only be released under specific conditions, such as full repayment of obligations or a credit rating upgrade. However, under federal bankruptcy and state fraudulent transfer laws, these guarantees could be voided if PM USA was insolvent at the time of the guarantee, defined as having debts exceeding the fair value of its assets or being unable to meet its liabilities as they matured. In 2023, the risk of insolvency for PM USA remained prominent, with the same legal thresholds applied to assess its financial health. The continued reliance on PM USA\u2019s guarantees by Altria in 2023, without evidence of improved asset valuation or reduced contingent liabilities, suggests a stable or potentially increased insolvency risk for PM USA, especially if Altria\u2019s debt burden grew or PM USA\u2019s asset base weakened.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MO(2022) \u2192 PM USA: MO depended on PM USA to guarantee its debt obligations, including under credit agreements and commercial paper programs, with PM USA acting as the primary guarantor.",
        "Hop 2: PM USA \u2192 Insolvency: The guarantees could be voided under bankruptcy or fraudulent transfer laws if PM USA was insolvent at the time of guarantee, defined as having debts exceeding asset value or being unable to meet liabilities as they matured.",
        "Hop 3: Insolvency \u2190 MO(2023): In 2023, the same insolvency criteria applied, and with MO continuing to rely on PM USA for guarantees, the risk of insolvency for PM USA remained contingent on MO\u2019s financial demands and PM USA\u2019s own asset-liability position."

The fair value of these instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges.\n\nLevel 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of over-the-counter ('OTC') currency exchange forwards, options and swaps; commodity forwards and options; net investment hedge contracts; and interest rate swaps. Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our bifurcated exchange options are valued, as derivative instrument liabilities, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related to the market price of the underlying note and associated credit spread combined with the share of price, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility of the JDE Peet's shares over the life of the option. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our derivative contracts do not have a legal right of set-off. We manage the credit risk in connection with these and all our derivatives by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.",

          "chunk_text": "\nLevel 1 financial assets and liabilities consist of exchange-traded commodity futures and listed options. The fair value of these instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges.\n\nLevel 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of over-the-counter ('OTC') currency exchange forwards, options and swaps; commodity forwards and options; net investment hedge contracts; and interest rate swaps. Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our bifurcated exchange options are valued, as derivative instrument liabilities, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related to the market price of the underlying note and associated credit spread combined with the share of price, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility of the JDE Peet's shares over the life of the option. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our derivative contracts do not have a legal right of set-off. We manage the credit risk in connection with these and all our derivatives by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PEP's International Plan Assets included $736M in Government Securities, which increased to $1,207M in 2023, representing a 64% rise. This significant increase in Government Securities within the International Plan Assets suggests a strategic shift toward safer, more stable investments in their global pension fund allocation. Given that Government Securities are typically lower risk and provide steady returns, this reallocation may indicate a more conservative approach to managing international pension liabilities in 2023 compared to the prior year.",

      "question": "How did MDLZ's beverage segment performance in 2022, particularly in the AMEA region, influence its asset allocation strategy in AMEA for 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ generated $546 million in beverage revenues from the AMEA region, which accounted for 1.9% of the region\u2019s total revenues. Although beverages represented a relatively small portion of the AMEA portfolio, the region itself remained a significant asset holder, with total assets increasing slightly from $9.88 billion in 2022 to $9.965 billion in 2023. This suggests that despite the modest contribution from beverages, MDLZ continued to maintain and slightly expand its asset base in AMEA, indicating strategic confidence in the region\u2019s long-term potential. The persistence of strong asset allocation in AMEA, even with limited beverage-driven revenue growth, implies that other product lines or market dynamics were driving continued investment.",

      "answer": "In 2023, PM's acquisition of Swedish Match AB significantly expanded its presence in the U.S. nicotine pouch market under the ZYN brand. This acquisition added $6,121 million in Euro credit facility borrowings related to the Swedish Match integration, reflecting the financial commitment to this strategic pivot. By 2024, PM had increased the geographic availability of ZYN from 2023 levels (implied by the 2023 acquisition) to 37 markets globally. This expansion was part of a broader strategy to transition toward smoke-free products, aligning with the integration of Swedish Match AB into PM's regional structure and the reorganization of its business segments to better leverage the ZYN brand's growth potential.",

IQOS was  first introduced in Nagoya, Japan, in 2014.\n\nIQOS and ZYN are the leading brands in our SFPs portfolio. As of December 31, 2024, our smoke-free products were available for sale in 95 markets. With regard to nicotine pouches, we increased our presence to 37 markets.\n\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 170 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by Marlboro ,  the  world's  best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 40% of our total 2024 cigarette shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament . Our other leading international cigarette brands are Chesterfield, L&amp;M , and Philip Morris. These five international cigarette brands contributed 80% of our cigarette shipment volume in 2024. We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as Dji  Sam  Soe and Sampoerna  A in  Indonesia,  and Fortune and Jackpot in the Philippines.\n\n## Source of Funds - Dividends\n\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries.

As  a  holding  company,  our  principal  sources  of  funds,  including  funds  to  make  payment  on  our  debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions that are otherwise compliant with law, including governmental capital and foreign currency exchange controls.\n\n## Description of Business\n\nFollowing the combination and the progress in 2023 toward the integration of the Swedish Match business into PMI's existing regional structure, PMI updated in January 2024 its segment reporting by including the former Swedish Match segment results into the four existing geographical segments. Our four geographical segments are as follows:\n\n- Europe Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe;\n- South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA\") is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia;\n- East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU &amp; PMI DF\") is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia &amp; Australia; and\n- Americas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.\n\nOur Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&amp;H\") segment, which includes the operating results of our Wellness and Healthcare business, remained unchanged in 2024.\n\nFollowing the sale of V ectura G roup Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining Wellness &amp; Healthcare results in the Europe segment. In addition, we will be renaming our 'PMI Duty Free' business to 'PMI G lobal Travel Retail' effective in the first quarter of 2025. As a result of this change, PMI's segment that includes our duty free business will be renamed East Asia, Australia &amp; PMI G lobal Travel Retail ('EA, AU &amp; PMI GTR').  As of the first quarter of 2025, our reporting will reflect these changes.\n\nOur total shipment volume, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, increased by 2.5% in 2024 to 756.6 billion units, with shipment volume of heated tobacco units reaching 139.7 billion units in 2024, up from 125.3 billion units in 2023. Shipment volume of our principal cigarette brand, Marlboro , increased by 3.7% in 2024.\n\nReferences in this Form 10-K to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume, excluding the United States, total industry (or total market) and market shares, are our estimates for tax-paid products based on data from a number of internal and external sources, and may, in defined instances, exclude China. Past reported periods may be updated to ensure comparability and to incorporate the most current information for industry and market share reporting.",

      "question": "How did PM's experience with the RBH valuation in 2022, which used an 8% discount rate and 2.5% terminal growth rate, shape its approach to valuing intangible assets like trademarks and customer relationships in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PM used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model with an 8% discount rate and a 2.5% terminal growth rate to estimate the fair value of its investment in RBH following its deconsolidation. This valuation methodology demonstrated the importance of judgment in selecting key assumptions, particularly in uncertain environments. By 2023, PM had institutionalized this approach by explicitly testing the reasonableness of assumptions such as revenue growth rates, profit margins, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, and discount rates when valuing intangible assets like trademarks and customer relationships. The 2023 disclosures show that PM continued to rely on DCF-based methods and emphasized the evaluation of valuation methodologies, indicating a direct evolution from the RBH case to broader asset valuation practices. This continuity suggests that PM refined its risk assessment and validation processes based on the RBH experience, applying similar rigor and specialized oversight to ensure consistency and reliability in valuing other critical intangible assets.",

          "chunk_text": "## Note 20.\n\n## Deconsolidation of RBH:\n\nAs discussed in Note 17. Contingencies, following the March 1, 2019, judgment of the Court of Appeal of Qu\u00e9bec in two class action lawsuits against PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. (\"RBH\"), PMI recorded in its consolidated results a pre-tax charge of $194 million, representing $142 million net of tax, in the first quarter of 2019. This pre-tax Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense  was  included  in  marketing,  administration  and  research  costs  on  PMI's  consolidated  statement  of  earnings  for  the  year  ended December 31, 2019. The charge reflects PMI's assessment of the portion of the judgment that represents probable and estimable loss prior to  the  deconsolidation  of  RBH  and  corresponds  to  the  trust  account  deposit  required  by  the  judgment.  RBH's  share  of  the  deposit  is approximately CAD 257 million.\n\nOn March 22, 2019, RBH obtained an initial order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (\"CCAA\"), which is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees.\n\nThe administration of the CCAA process, principally relating to the powers provided to the court and the court appointed monitor, removes certain elements of control of the business from both PMI and RBH. As a result, PMI has determined that it no longer has a controlling financial interest over RBH as defined in ASC 810 (Consolidation), and PMI deconsolidated RBH as of the date of the CCAA filing. PMI has also determined that it does not exert \"significant influence\" over RBH as that term is defined in ASC 323 (Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures). Therefore, as of March 22, 2019, PMI accounted for its continuing investment in RBH in accordance with ASC 321 (Investments-Equity Securities) as an equity security, without readily determinable fair value.\n\nFollowing the deconsolidation, the carrying value of assets and liabilities of RBH was removed from the consolidated balance sheet of PMI, and the continuing investment in RBH was recorded at fair value at the date of deconsolidation. The total amount deconsolidated from PMI's balance sheet was $3,519 million, including $1,323 million of cash, $1,463 million of goodwill, $529 million of accumulated other comprehensive earnings, primarily related to historical currency translation and $204 million of other assets and liabilities, net. While PMI is accounting for its investment in RBH as an equity security, PMI would recognize dividends as income upon receipt. However, while it remains under creditor protection, RBH does not anticipate paying dividends.\n\nThe fair value of PMI's continuing investment in RBH of $3,280 million was determined at the date of deconsolidation, recorded within equity investments and is assessed for impairment on an ongoing basis. The estimated fair value of the underlying business was determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis, as well as a market approach for certain contingent liabilities. The information used in the estimate includes observable inputs, primarily a discount rate of 8%, a terminal growth rate of 2.5% and information about total tobacco market size in Canada and RBH's share of the market, as well as unobservable inputs such as operating budgets and strategic plans, various inflation scenarios, estimated shipment volumes, and expected product pricing and projected margins.\n\nThe difference between the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of RBH that were deconsolidated and the fair value of the continuing investment, as determined at the date of deconsolidation, was $239 million, before tax, and this loss on deconsolidation is reflected within marketing, administration and research costs on PMI's consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019. PMI also recorded a tax benefit of $49 million within the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019, related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability on unremitted earnings of RBH.\n\nRBH is party to transactions with PMI and its consolidated subsidiaries entered into in the normal course of business; these transactions include royalty payments and recharge of various corporate expenses for services benefiting RBH. Up to the date of the CCAA filing, these transactions were eliminated on consolidation and had no impact on PMI's consolidated statement of earnings. After deconsolidating RBH, these transactions are treated as third-party transactions in PMI's financial statements. The amount of these related-party transactions is included within Note 4. Related Parties - Equity investments and Other.\n\nDevelopments in the CCAA process, including resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all pending tobacco-related litigation currently stayed in Canada, as discussed in Note 17. Contingencies , could result in a material change in the fair value of PMI's continuing investment in RBH.",

By 2023, MO's disclosures reflected concrete implementation of these trends: six U.S. states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Utah) and the District of Columbia had passed legislation banning characterizing flavors in tobacco products, with some states like New York and Utah exempting products that received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway. Additionally, MO noted that several states required e-vapor manufacturers to certify compliance with FDA regulations to sell in-state, aligning with the FCTC's broader advocacy for stricter regulatory frameworks. These developments indicate that FCTC-influenced global regulatory momentum translated into specific marketing restrictions that MO faced in 2023, particularly around flavor limitations and premarket authorization compliance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nmanufacturers. The cost of the FDA user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to FDA user fees and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares, all as prescribed by the FSPTCA and FDA regulations. Payments for user fees are adjusted for several factors, including market share and industry volume. For a discussion of the impact of the FDA user fee payments on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below. In addition, compliance with the FSPTCA's regulatory requirements has resulted, and will continue to result, in additional costs for Altria's tobacco operating companies. The amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year to date period but could become material, either individually or in the aggregate, to one or more of Altria's tobacco subsidiaries.\n\n- Investigation and Enforcement: The FDA has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it, including document requests and other required information submissions, facility inspections, examinations and investigations, injunction proceedings, monetary penalties, product withdrawal and recall orders, and product seizures. Investigations or enforcement actions could result in significant costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the business of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\n## Excise Taxes\n\nTobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the United States. Significant increases in tobacco-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted (including with respect to e-vapor products) and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal, state and local levels within the United States. The frequency and magnitude of excise tax increases can be influenced by various factors, including the composition of executive and legislative bodies.\n\nDuring 2021, Congress considered legislation that would have significantly increased the federal excise tax for all tobacco products and created a new tax for e-vapor products and other products containing nicotine that are not currently subject to a tobacco federal excise tax ('novel tobacco products'). The U.S. House of Representatives removed the proposal to increase the federal excise tax on tobacco products currently subject to the tax from the legislation it was considering, but retained the proposed nicotine tax for novel tobacco products. The U.S. Senate debated the legislation and removed the nicotine tax for novel tobacco products; however, as of February 22, 2022, the legislation is still pending before the Senate and could be subject to further tax related amendments.\n\nFederal, state and local cigarette excise taxes have increased substantially over the past two decades, far outpacing the rate of inflation. Between the end of 1998 and February 22, 2022, the weighted-average state cigarette excise tax increased from $0.36 to $1.89 per pack. As of February 22, 2022, no state has enacted new legislation increasing cigarette excise taxes in 2022, but various increases are under consideration or have been proposed.\n\nA majority of states currently tax MST using an ad valorem method, which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product, typically the wholesale price. This ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lower-priced products of equal weight. Altria supports legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on MST to a weight-based methodology because, unlike the ad valorem tax, a weight-based tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax. As of February 22, 2022, the federal government, 23 states, Puerto Rico, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Cook County, Illinois have adopted a weight-based tax methodology for MST.\n\nAn increasing number of states and localities also are imposing excise taxes on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouches. As of February 22, 2022, 30 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and a number of cities and counties have enacted legislation to tax e-vapor products. These taxes are calculated in varying ways and may differ based on the e-vapor product form. Similarly, 11 states and the District of Columbia have enacted legislation to tax oral nicotine pouches.\n\nTax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on product sales of Altria's tobacco operating companies and JUUL through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the non-premium or discount segments, to lower taxed tobacco products, or to counterfeit and contraband products. Lower sales volume and reported share performance of Altria's tobacco operating companies' and investees' products could have a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated financial position or earnings. In addition, substantial excise tax increases on e-vapor and oral nicotine products, may negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\n## International Treaty on Tobacco Control\n\nThe World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the 'FCTC') entered into force in February 2005. As of February 22, 2022, 181 countries, as well as the European Union, have become parties to the FCTC. While the United States is a signatory of the FCTC, it is not currently a party to the agreement, as the agreement has not been submitted to, or ratified by, the U.S. Senate. The FCTC is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. The treaty recommends (and in certain instances, requires) signatory nations to enact legislation that would address various tobacco-related issues.\n\nThere are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the FCTC, some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of tobacco products. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these",

          "chunk_text": "If  nonetheless there is a significant usage of our products or competitive products among youth or non-smokers, even in situations over which  we  have  no  control,  our  credibility  may  suffer,  and  our  efforts  to  advocate  for  the  development  of  science-based  regulatory frameworks for the commercialization of RRPs may be significantly impacted.\n\nMoreover, the FDA's premarket tobacco product and modified risk tobacco product authorizations of a version of our Platform 1 product are subject to strict marketing, reporting and other requirements. Although we have received these product authorizations from the FDA, there is  no  guarantee that the product will remain authorized for sale in the U.S., particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or nonsmoker initiation.\n\n## The financial and business performance of our reduced-risk products is less predictable than our cigarette business.\n\nOur RRPs are novel products in a new category, and the pace at which adult smokers adopt them may vary, depending on the competitive, regulatory, fiscal and cultural environment, and other factors in a specific market. There may be periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for these products, the timing and drivers of which may be more difficult for us to predict versus our mature cigarette business. The impact of this lower predictability on our projected results for a specific period may be significant, particularly during the early  stages  of  this  new  product  category,  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  as  a  result  of  unpredictability  due  to  shortage  of  key components in our supply chain.\n\n## We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to differentiate reduced-risk products and cigarettes with respect to taxation.\n\nTo date, we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our RRPs are not cigarettes due to the absence of combustion, and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products, which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes. Nevertheless, we are unable to predict whether regulators will be issuing new regulations where RRP will be equally taxed  in  line  with  other  tobacco  products  such  as  ordinary  cigarettes.  However,  if  we  cease  to  be  successful  in  these  efforts,  RRP  unit margins may be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Consumption of tax-paid cigarettes continues to decline in many of our markets.\n\nThis decline is due to multiple factors, including increased taxes and pricing, governmental actions, the diminishing social acceptance of smoking  and  health  concerns,  competition,  continuing  economic  and  geopolitical  uncertainty,  and  the  continuing  prevalence  of  illicit products. These factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in Item 7, Business Environment . A continuous decline in the consumption of cigarettes could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\n\n## Cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. Significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. These tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors.\n\nTax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other combustible  tobacco  products,  or  disproportionately  affect  the  relative  retail  price  of  our  cigarette  brands  versus  cigarette  brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. Because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium-price cigarette category, tax regimes based  on  sales  price  can  place  us  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  in  certain  markets.  Furthermore,  our  volume  and  profitability  may  be adversely affected in these markets.\n\nIn addition, increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other combustible tobacco products and from the premium-price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products, or to illicit products such as contraband, counterfeit and \"illicit whites.\"\n\n## Our  business  faces  significant  governmental  action  aimed  at  increasing  regulatory  requirements  with  the  goal  of  reducing  or preventing the use of tobacco products.\n\nGovernmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volumes for our products in many of our markets, and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels  and  will  increase  down-trading  and  the  risk  of  counterfeiting,  contraband,  \"illicit  whites\"  and  legal  cross-border  purchases. Significant regulatory developments will continue to take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the \"FCTC\"). Since it came into force in 2005, the FCTC has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the  marketing  and  sale  of  tobacco  products  to  adult  smokers.  Regulatory  initiatives  that  have  been  proposed,  introduced  or  enacted  by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions include:\n\n- restrictions on or licensing of outlets permitted to sell cigarettes;\n- the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;",

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ had a clear and substantial focus on biscuit revenues in the AMEA region, as evidenced by the $1,844 million in revenue from biscuits, which accounted for 7.8% of the region\u2019s total net revenues. This indicates that biscuits were a meaningful contributor to MDLZ's performance in AMEA during that year. By 2024, while the company continued to produce biscuits, it did not provide region-specific revenue data, making it impossible to directly compare performance or assess any changes in regional emphasis. The absence of 2024 AMEA biscuit revenue data suggests a shift in reporting transparency, but not necessarily in operational focus, as biscuit production remained active.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PEP reported $221 million in real estate commingled funds as part of its international plan assets, which decreased to $162 million in 2023. This indicates a strategic reduction in real estate exposure within the international pension portfolio over the year. The real estate commingled funds are a subset of the broader international plan assets, which themselves declined from $4,624 million in 2022 to $3,528 million in 2023. This suggests a deliberate rebalancing or risk adjustment in the company's international pension investments.",

While forecasted transactions were explicitly excluded from the VAR model, the decline in VAR suggests that the hedging instruments included in the model\u2014such as interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives\u2014were more effective in offsetting market risks. This improvement was attributed to reduced interest rate volatility, demonstrating that the company's risk management strategy successfully adapted to changing market conditions even as transactional exposure remained high.",

While various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation, the Company's computations are based on a variance/co-variance technique, which assesses the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company's debt, interest rate and foreign exchange, and commodities derivatives, and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level.\n\nThe VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.\n\nVAR on a combined basis decreased to $255 million at September 28, 2024 from $284 million at September 30, 2023 due to reduced interest rate volatility.\n\nThe estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How did the changes in Altria Group's (MO) reliance on PM USA's guarantees under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of risk exposure related to potential insolvency or fraudulent conveyance claims?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Altria Group (MO) relied heavily on PM USA, its 100% owned subsidiary, to guarantee its obligations under debt securities, credit agreements, and commercial paper programs. These guarantees were subject to the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA), and if PM USA was deemed insolvent or received less than fair consideration, the guarantees could be voided or subordinated. The 2022 filing highlighted that PM USA's obligations were capped at a maximum amount that would not trigger fraudulent conveyance claims under UFTA or similar laws. By 2024, the structure of these guarantees remained largely unchanged, but the documentation emphasized the continued exposure to legal risk under the UFTA, particularly if PM USA's financial condition deteriorated or if it could not pay its debts as they matured. The evolution of this relationship shows that while the structure remained stable, the risk profile under UFTA remained a consistent concern, with no indication of reduced exposure or structural mitigation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MO(2022) \u2192 PM USA: MO depended on PM USA to guarantee its debt obligations, with the risk of voidance under UFTA if PM USA was insolvent or received inadequate value.",
        "Hop 2: PM USA \u2192 Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act: The guarantees were explicitly subject to UFTA, which could void or subordinate the guarantees if PM USA\u2019s obligations were deemed fraudulent transfers.",
        "Hop 3: Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act \u2190 MO(2024): In 2024, MO continued to rely on the same guarantee structure with PM USA, and the UFTA risk remained a central legal constraint with no structural changes to mitigate exposure."

This adjustment was a key driver in the $400 million (19.1%) increase in segment operating income year-over-year, alongside other factors like lower integration costs and productivity gains. The shift from a liability in 2023 to a favorable adjustment in 2024 reflects a change in the valuation assumptions tied to Level 3 inputs, likely indicating better-than-expected performance or revised forecasts for Clif Bar.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MDLZ(2023) \u2192 Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3): MDLZ had a $548 million contingent consideration liability for Clif Bar categorized under Level 3 fair value inputs.",
        "Hop 2: Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) \u2192 Clif Bar: The $548 million liability was directly tied to the acquisition of Clif Bar, with its valuation based on unobservable inputs due to lack of market data.",
        "Hop 3: Clif Bar \u2190 MDLZ(2024): In 2024, a favorable contingent consideration adjustment related to Clif Bar positively impacted segment operating income by $400 million, indicating a revaluation of the Level 3 liability."

T he impact of our 2023 div estiture of the dev eloped market gum business resulted in a year-ov er-year reduction in net rev enues of $310 million. Unfav orable currency translation rate changes were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relativ e to the Canadian dollar. Volume/mix was flat for the year as v olume trends improv ed in the second half of 2024 offsetting consumer softness experienced in the U.S. in the first half of 2024. Ov erall, a v olume/mix gain in chocolate was offset by declines in biscuits &amp; baked snacks and candy. Higher net pricing, driv en by input cost-driv en pricing actions, was reflected across all categories.\n\nSegment operating income increased $400 million (19.1%), primarily due to a fav orable contingent consideration adjustment related to Clif Bar as well as lower  acquisition  integration  costs,  higher  net  pricing,  lower  manufacturing  costs  due  to  productiv ity,  lapping  prior-year  intangible  asset  impairment charges,  lower  div estiture-related  costs,  lower  other  selling,  general  and  administrativ e  expenses  and  lower  fixed  asset  impairment  charges.

Higher net pricing, driv en by input cost-driv en pricing actions, was reflected across all categories.

      "answer": "In 2022, Altria adjusted its pension plan asset allocation from 30% equity/70% fixed income to a more liability-hedging focused 20%/80% split, aiming to reduce equity volatility exposure and better align asset values with liabilities. This strategy included a diversified mix of equities, fixed income, and other securities. By 2024, Altria's pension plan investments included collective investment funds specifically designed to mirror indices like the S&P 500 and MSCI EAFE Index, which were valued using net asset value (NAV) provided by investment managers. These funds were part of the broader diversification strategy but represented a more targeted approach to index exposure compared to the general 'other securities' category in 2022. The evolution shows a shift toward more structured index-tracking vehicles within the broader diversification framework.",

The objective of this change is to further reduce the overall exposure to equity volatility and more closely align the values of plan assets with the liabilities. The target allocation between fixed income and growth assets balances pension liability hedging and asset growth in order to maintain the plan's funded status and cover incremental service accruals and interest cost. Liability hedging is achieved through investing in rate-sensitive fixed income securities, primarily corporate bonds and U.S. Treasuries, while growth assets are comprised of publicly traded equity securities.\n\nAltria's investment strategy for its postretirement plan assets is aimed at maximizing the total asset return based on expectation that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the long term and reflects the maturity structure of the benefit obligation. The equity/fixed income target allocation for postretirement plan assets remains unchanged at 55%/45%.\n\nAltria believes that it implements these investment strategies in a prudent and risk-controlled manner, consistent with the fiduciary requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, by investing retirement plan assets in a well-diversified mix of equities, fixed income and other securities.\n\nThe actual composition of Altria's plan assets at December 31, 2021 was broadly characterized with the following allocation:\n\n",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value.\n\n- U.S. and Foreign Government Securities : U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities, agency bonds and municipal securities. Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Corporate Debt Instruments : Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Common Stock : Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date.\n- Asset Backed Securities : Asset backed securities are fix ed income securities such as mortgage backed securities and auto loans that are collateralized by pools of underlying assets that are unable to be sold individually. They are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information or a broker quote in a non-active over-the-counter market.\n- Collective Investment Funds : Collective investment funds consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index. They are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective collective investment funds, which are valued based on the net asset value ('NAV'), and are provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCash Flows: We make contributions to our pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax deductible and pay benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. Currently, we anticipate making employer contributions to our pension and postretirement plans of up to approximately $30 million for each in 2025. However, the foregoing estimates of 2025 contributions to our pension and postretirement plans are subject to change as a result of changes in tax  and other benefit laws, changes in interest rates, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return for each respective plan.",

Biscuits represented 7.8% of AMEA\u2019s net revenues in 2021, indicating a significant regional reliance on this product category. By 2023, MDLZ reported $9,965 million in total assets in AMEA, a slight increase from $9,882 million in 2022, despite a broader decline from $10,386 million in 2021. This suggests a strategic reallocation of assets in AMEA, likely aimed at stabilizing or growing biscuit-related operations in response to the 2022 performance challenges. The persistence of biscuit dependence in AMEA's revenue mix likely shaped MDLZ\u2019s decision to maintain or slightly increase investment in the region despite broader cost pressures and volume declines in key markets.",

The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give &amp; Go added incremental net revenues of $106 million and the January 4, 2021 acquisition of Hu added incremental net revenues of $38 million in 2021. Higher net pricing was driven by biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by lower net pricing in chocolate. Favorable currency impact was due to the strength of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Unfavorable volume mix reflected volume declines as the region lapped prior-year strong volume growth driven by significantly increased food purchases for in-home consumption due to the pandemic as well as impacts from labor disruptions and supply chain constraints in the second half of 2021. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in biscuits, candy, chocolate and gum.\n\nSegment operating income decreased $216 million (13.6%), primarily due to unfavorable volume/mix, higher raw material costs, higher Simplify to Grow Program costs and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including lower COVID-19 related costs), a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower manufacturing costs (lower incremental COVID-19 related costs and productivity) and favorable currency.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $1,049 million (14.8%), due to favorable volume/mix (6.3 pp), the impact of acquisitions (6.3 pp) and higher net pricing (2.3 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix, in part due to the positive volume impact from COVID-19 as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption, was driven by gains in biscuits, partially offset by declines in gum, chocolate and candy. The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give &amp; Go added incremental net revenues of $390 million and the July 16, 2019 acquisition of a majority interest in Perfect Snacks added net revenues of $55 million in 2020.

Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar.\n\nSegment operating income increased $136 million (9.4%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing and the impact of acquisitions.

      "question": "How did Altria's financial obligations through PM USA evolve from 2022 to 2023, particularly in relation to ALCS's guaranteed liabilities and the supplier financing program?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PM USA, a subsidiary of Altria, fully and unconditionally guaranteed Altria\u2019s obligations under its debt securities, credit agreements, and commercial paper program. The Guarantees included a $19 million contingent liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, reflecting PM USA\u2019s direct financial exposure to Altria\u2019s obligations. PM USA also leased a research and technology center to ALCS, indicating a direct operational and financial dependency between the two entities. By 2023, Altria had expanded its intercompany financial commitments, with ALCS now being supported by a supplier financing program guarantee from Altria under the financing program agreement. This indicates a strategic shift where Altria directly assumed financial responsibility for ALCS\u2019s obligations, beyond the earlier leasing arrangement. This evolution shows a deepening financial interdependence between Altria, PM USA, and ALCS, with Altria taking on increased liability exposure through both direct guarantees and operational support mechanisms.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n\nPM USA (the 'Guarantor'), which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

Unresolved Staff Comments.\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 2. Properties.\n\nALCS owns one property in Richmond, Virginia that serves as the headquarters facilities for Altria, PM USA, USSTC, Middleton, Helix and certain other subsidiaries.\n\nPM USA owns and operates a manufacturing facility located in Richmond, Virginia that PM USA uses in the manufacturing of cigarettes (smokeable products segment). PM USA leases portions of this facility to other Altria subsidiaries for use in the manufacturing of cigars (smokeable products segment) and MST, snus and oral nicotine pouch products (oral tobacco products segment). In addition, PM USA owns a research and technology center in Richmond, Virginia that is leases to ALCS.\n\nThe oral tobacco products segment has various manufacturing and processing facilities, the most significant of which are located in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nThe plants and properties owned or leased and operated by Altria and its subsidiaries are maintained in good condition and are believed to be suitable and adequate for present needs.\n\n## Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\n\nThe information required by this Item is included in Note 18 and Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this Form 10-K. Altria's consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2021 were filed on Form 8-K on January 27, 2022 (such consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are also included in Item 8). The following summarizes certain developments in Altria's litigation since the filing of the Form 8-K.\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n## \u25aa Engle Progeny Trial Results\n\nIn Gloger , in February 2022, the Florida Third District Court of Appeals reversed the trial court verdict against PM USA and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and remanded the case for a new trial.\n\nIn Jordan , in February 2022, PM USA filed a notice to invoke the discretionary jurisdiction of the Florida Supreme Court.\n\nIn Kaplan , in February 2022, the Florida Supreme Court vacated the $2 million compensatory damages award against PM USA based on its decision in Sheffield and remanded the case to the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeals for reconsideration.\n\n## \u25aa E-Vapor Product Litigation\n\nIn the lawsuit filed by the Alaska Attorney General, in February 2022, the court granted Altria's motion to dismiss the public nuisance claim, but denied its motion to dismiss the other claims.\n\n## \u25aa Antitrust Litigation\n\nIn February 2022, in the FTC administrative complaint against Altria and JUUL, the administrative law judge dismissed the FTC's complaint. FTC complaint counsel appealed that decision to the FTC Commissioners. Any adverse ruling the FTC Commissioners issue following their review may be appealed to any U.S. Court of Appeals.\n\n## Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\n\nNot applicable.",

      "question": "How did the allocation of PEP's International Plan Assets to Real Estate Commingled Funds change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this shift indicate about the company's investment strategy in real estate within its international pension portfolio?",
      "answer": "In 2023, PEP's International Plan Assets included $162 million in Real Estate Commingled Funds, which decreased to $79 million in 2024. This represents a significant reduction of approximately 51.2% in the company's exposure to real estate within its international pension portfolio. The decrease suggests a strategic shift away from real estate investments in favor of other asset classes, such as the increase in government securities and corporate bonds observed during the same period. This evolution in the entity chain reflects a recalibration of risk and return expectations for international pension assets.",

        "Hop 1: PEP(2023) \u2192 International Plan Assets: PEP allocated $3,528 million to international pension assets in 2023, including $162 million in Real Estate Commingled Funds.",
        "Hop 2: International Plan Assets \u2192 Real Estate Commingled Funds: Real Estate Commingled Funds represent a specific asset class within the broader international plan assets portfolio.",

      "question": "What does the reduction in appeal bonds posted by PM USA from $50 million in 2022 to $35 million in 2023 indicate about MO's evolving litigation risk profile in tobacco-related cases?",
      "answer": "The reduction in appeal bonds from $50 million in 2022 to $35 million in 2023 suggests that MO's litigation risk exposure in tobacco-related cases has decreased. This is supported by the increase in total judgments and settlements paid by PM USA from $896 million as of December 31, 2021, to over $1 billion as of December 31, 2023. This indicates that PM USA has resolved more cases over time, reducing the number of outstanding judgments requiring appeal bonds. Furthermore, the decrease in appeal bonds corresponds with a slight drop in the collateralized restricted cash associated with these bonds, reflecting a lower need for security as the company progresses through the litigation lifecycle. This trend implies a strategic resolution of legacy tobacco litigation, which reduces future financial obligations and risk volatility.",

        "Hop 1: MO(2022) \u2192 PM USA: MO depends on PM USA as a guarantor for its debt obligations, indicating the subsidiary's central role in the company's financial risk structure.",

        "Hop 3: Appeal Bonds \u2190 MO(2023): In 2023, MO reports a decrease in appeal bonds from $50 million to $35 million, indicating fewer ongoing litigated cases requiring financial security."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n\nPM USA (the 'Guarantor'), which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

Pre-tax charges for tobacco and health and certain other litigation were included in marketing, administration and research costs on Altria's consolidated statements of earnings (losses). Pre-tax charges for related interest costs were included in interest and other debt expense, net on Altria's consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\nAfter exhausting all appeals in those cases resulting in adverse verdicts associated with tobacco-related litigation, since October 2004, PM USA has paid judgments and settlements (including related costs and fees) totaling approximately $896 million and interest totaling approximately $227 million as of December 31, 2021. These amounts include payments for Engle progeny judgments (and related costs and fees) totaling approximately $410 million and related interest totaling approximately $56 million.\n\nSecurity for Judgments: To obtain stays of judgments pending appeal, PM USA has posted various forms of security. As of December 31, 2021, PM USA has posted appeal bonds totaling approximately $50 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that are included in assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Overview of Altria and/or PM USA Tobacco-Related Litigation\n\nTypes and Number of U.S. Cases: Claims related to tobacco products generally fall within the following categories: (i) smoking and health cases alleging personal injury brought on behalf of individual plaintiffs; (ii) health care cost recovery cases brought by governmental (both domestic and foreign) plaintiffs seeking reimbursement for health care expenditures allegedly caused by cigarette smoking and/or disgorgement of profits; (iii) e-vapor cases alleging violation of RICO, fraud, failure to warn, design defect, negligence, antitrust and unfair trade practices; and (iv) other tobacco-related litigation described below.

      "answer": "In 2022, MO reported a significant impairment of JUUL equity securities amounting to $2,600 million, indicating a substantial financial setback tied to its investment in JUUL. This exposure likely prompted MO to reassess its approach to the e-vapor market, particularly in light of JUUL's uncertain regulatory trajectory, including its pending PMTA submissions. By 2024, MO shifted strategy by acquiring full ownership of NJOY, a company with a more favorable FDA regulatory track record. MO submitted a supplemental PMTA for the NJOY ACE 2.0 device in May 2024, incorporating advanced age-verification technology to address FDA concerns about underage use. This strategic pivot from JUUL to NJOY suggests that MO's earlier financial losses with JUUL directly influenced its more cautious and technologically adaptive PMTA approach in 2024.",

Through these processes, a manufacturer could receive (i) a 'not substantially equivalent' determination, (ii) a denial of a PMTA or (iii) a marketing order withdrawal by the FDA on one or more products, which would require the removal of the product or products from the market. Such actions could have a material adverse impact on the business and consolidated results of operations of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\nProvisional Products : Most cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by PM USA and USSTC are 'Provisional Products.' Altria's subsidiaries timely submitted SE reports for these Provisional Products. PM USA and USSTC have received SE determinations on certain Provisional Products. Those products that were found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent (certain smokeless tobacco products) had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA's determinations; therefore, those determinations did not impact business results. PM USA and USSTC have other Provisional Products that continue to be subject to the FDA's pre-market review process. In the meantime, they can continue marketing these products unless the FDA determines that a specific Provisional Product is not substantially equivalent.\n\nIn addition, the FDA has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of Provisional Product SE reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further FDA review. PM USA and USSTC have Provisional Products included in this subset of products.\n\nWhile Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies believe their current Provisional Products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, they cannot predict how the FDA will ultimately apply law, regulation and guidance to their various SE reports. Should Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies receive unfavorable determinations on any SE reports currently pending with the FDA, they believe they can replace the vast majority of their respective product volumes with other FDA authorized products or with Grandfathered Products.\n\nNon-Provisional Products : Cigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after March 22, 2011 are 'Non-Provisional Products' and must receive a marketing order from the FDA prior to being offered for sale. Marketing orders for Non-Provisional Products may be obtained by filing an SE report, PMTA or using another pre-market pathway established by the FDA. Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies may not be able to obtain a marketing order for non-provisional products because the FDA may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval.\n\nProducts Regulated in 2016 : Manufacturers of products first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an SE report or PMTA by the filing deadline of September 9, 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market. These products can remain on the market during FDA review through court-allowed, case-by-case discretion, so long as the report or application was timely filed with the FDA. Due to the large number of applications received by September 9, 2020, the FDA did not complete its review of all submitted applications by September 9, 2021, although it represents that it has made decisions on more than 98% of the applications, with most being marketing denial orders and a few marketing granted orders for tobacco flavor e-vapor products. A number of the marketing denial orders are subject to litigation challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers. For those products still under FDA review, it is uncertain when and for how long the FDA may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its case-by-case discretion. For products (new or modified) not on the market as of August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file an SE report or PMTA and receive FDA authorization prior to marketing and selling the product.\n\nHelix submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020. JUUL submitted PMTAs to the FDA for its e-vapor device and the related tobacco and menthol flavors in July 2020. As of February 22, 2022, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or JUUL products. In addition, as of February 22, 2022, Middleton has received market orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn December 2013, Altria's subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with PMI, including an agreement that grants Altria an exclusive right to commercialize certain of PMI's heated tobacco products in the United States, subject to FDA authorization of the applicable products. PMI submitted a PMTA and a MRTP application with the FDA for its electronically heated tobacco products comprising the IQOS Tobacco Heating System . The IQOS devices heat, but do not burn tobacco. In April 2019, the FDA authorized the PMTA for the IQOS Tobacco Heating System and in July 2020, the FDA authorized the marketing of this system as a MRTP with a reduced exposure claim. In December 2020, the FDA authorized the PMTA for IQOS 3, an updated version of the IQOS devices. The MRTP authorization for the original IQOS device currently does not apply to the IQOS 3 device. PMI submitted an MRTP application for the IQOS 3 device in March 2021, which is currently under review by the FDA.\n\nIn September 2021, in connection with a patent dispute, the ITC issued a cease and desist order, effective as of November 29, 2021, banning (i) the importation of the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and infringing components into the United States and (ii) the sale, marketing and distribution of such imported products in the United States.

PLUS oral nicotine pouches in tobacco, mint and wintergreen flavors in June 2024. As of February 24, 2025, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or on! PLUS products.\n\nAs of February 24, 2025, Middleton has received marketing orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn October 2021, the FDA authorized the marketing and sale of four of USSTC's Verve oral nicotine products, including Green Mint and Blue Mint varieties, representing the first flavored product authorizations issued by the FDA for newly deemed innovative products. These products are not currently marketed or sold.\n\nIn March 2023, the FDA authorized USSTC to communicate a modified risk claim about its Copenhagen Classic Snuff MST product. This product is not currently marketed or sold. The authorized claim for Copenhagen Classic Snuff is 'IF YOU SMOKE, CONSIDER THIS: Switching completely to this product from cigarettes reduces risk of lung cancer.' In February 2025, USSTC filed a notice with the FDA withdrawing its modified risk application.\n\nAs a result of our June 2023 acquisition of NJOY Holdings, we gained full global ownership of NJOY's e-vapor product portfolio, including NJOY ACE , a pod-based e-vapor product with an MGO from the FDA, and NJOY DAILY , which also has an MGO. In June 2024, NJOY received MGOs with respect to two NJOY ACE menthol products and two NJOY DAILY menthol products. In May 2024, NJOY submitted a supplemental PMTA to the FDA to commercialize and market the NJOY ACE 2.0 device, which leverages Bluetooth connectivity to incorporate access restriction technology designed to prevent underage use by authenticating the user before unlocking the device. Also in May 2024, NJOY re-submitted PMTAs for blueberry and watermelon flavored pod-based e-vapor products that work exclusively with the Bluetooth -enabled NJOY ACE 2.0 device. These products previously received marketing denial orders ('MDOs') on the basis of FDA concerns regarding underage use. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nPost-Market Surveillance : Manufacturers that receive MGOs must adhere to the FDA post-market record keeping and reporting requirements, as detailed in market orders and in the final PMTA rule. The requirements include prior notification of marketing activities. The FDA may amend requirements of an MGO or withdraw the MGO based on this information if, among other reasons, it determines that the continued marketing of the products is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health.",

      "question": "How did MDLZ's reliance on Level 1 commodity futures for raw material price risk management in 2022 evolve in 2023, particularly in terms of their hedging practices and the valuation methodologies applied to these instruments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ valued Level 1 financial assets, including exchange-traded commodity futures, based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges. This transparent and market-driven valuation methodology reflected the company's exposure to raw material price volatility. In 2023, MDLZ continued to use commodity futures as part of its risk management strategy, entering into forward, futures, and option contracts to hedge forecasted purchases of commodities used as raw materials. Notably, the company also mentioned selling commodity futures to hedge future purchase commitments, indicating a more active hedging posture. The continued use of commodity futures across both years shows a consistent approach to managing raw material risk, but the explicit mention of selling futures in 2023 suggests a potential shift toward more dynamic hedging strategies. This evolution implies that MDLZ may have adapted its approach to better align with market conditions, while maintaining the use of observable market prices as the basis for valuation.",

      "answer": "PM's 2022 10-K highlights forward-looking cautionary statements about risks tied to their cigarette business, including litigation uncertainties. In 2023, PM USA, the company's largest cigarette subsidiary, reported a 9.9% decrease in cigarette shipment volume in the U.S., from 84.7 billion units in 2022 to 76.3 billion units in 2023. Despite this decline, PM's 2023 10-K reveals that PM USA remains a defendant in multiple Canadian class-action lawsuits, including the L\u00e9tourneau and Kunta cases, where plaintiffs are seeking substantial compensatory and punitive damages related to smoking addiction and health impacts. These ongoing legal challenges demonstrate that even with reduced cigarette shipments, PM USA continues to face significant litigation exposure, underscoring the long-tail liability risks inherent in the tobacco industry.",

Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies.\n\n## Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results\n\n## Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\n\nWe may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in filings with the SEC, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as \"strategy,\" \"expects,\" \"continues,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"will,\" \"aspires,\" \"estimates,\" \"intends,\" \"projects,\" \"aims,\" \"goals,\" \"targets,\" \"forecasts\" and other words of similar meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.\n\nWe cannot guarantee that  any  forward-looking  statement  will  be  realized,  although  we  believe  we  have  been  prudent  in  our  plans  and assumptions. Our RRPs constitute a new product category in its early stages that is less predictable than our mature cigarette business. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities.  In  connection  with  the  'safe  harbor'  provisions  of  the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act  of  1995,  we  are  identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any  forward-looking  statements  made  by  us;  any  such  statement  is  qualified  by  reference  to  the  following  cautionary  statements.  We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Business Environment of this section. You  should  understand  that  it  is  not  possible  to  predict  or  identify  all  risk  factors.  Consequently,  you  should  not  consider  this discussion of potential risks or uncertainties to be complete. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time, except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations.\n\n## Item 7A.

This unique regulatory advantage was reflected in the 2024 financial statements, where NJOY-related goodwill and intangible assets remained a significant part of MO\u2019s e-vapor reporting unit. The $2.9 billion acquisition in 2023, including $2.75 billion in cash and contingent consideration, signaled MO\u2019s strategic commitment to strengthening its presence in the evolving e-vapor market, with the 2024 disclosures indicating continued investment in this segment.",

However, the roll-forward information component of the standard was deferred until 2024. By 2024, CL implemented the full disclosure requirements, including roll-forward information, which enhanced transparency by providing stakeholders with a clearer picture of the changes in supplier finance obligations over time. This evolution in disclosure practices increased accountability and improved financial reporting clarity for investors.",

          "chunk_text": "## (Dollars in Millions Except Per S hare Amounts)\n\nIn August 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-05, 'Business Combinations-Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement.' This ASU requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

      "question": "How did MO's approach to PMTA authorizations for oral nicotine pouches evolve between 2022 and 2024, and what does this suggest about their regulatory risk management strategy and potential market expansion opportunities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MO (through Helix) had already submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020, indicating a proactive regulatory compliance strategy for newer products. By 2024, MO had submitted additional PMTAs for on! PLUS oral nicotine pouches in tobacco, mint, and wintergreen flavors in June 2024, showing a continued emphasis on expanding their portfolio of FDA-reviewed products. Additionally, MO's acquisition of NJOY Holdings in June 2023 brought e-vapor products with existing MGOs (Marketing Granted Orders), including NJOY ACE and DAILY, and in May 2024, NJOY re-submitted flavored pod-based e-vapor PMTAs that previously received MDOs (Marketing Denial Orders). This evolution suggests that MO is increasingly prioritizing regulatory risk mitigation by pursuing formal FDA authorization pathways, while also seeking to expand into new product categories with differentiated features like Bluetooth-enabled underage use prevention technology. However, as of February 24, 2025, the FDA had not issued marketing decisions for any on! or on! PLUS products, indicating ongoing regulatory uncertainty.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MO(2022) \u2192 Tobacco Products: MO's business remains heavily dependent on tobacco products, including newer categories like oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor devices.",

The FDA also may request comments on broad topics through an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ('ANPRM'). Altria's tobacco operating companies actively engage with the FDA to develop and implement the FSPTCA's regulatory framework, including submission of comments to various FDA policies and proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions.\n\nThe FDA's implementation of the FSPTCA and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by United States states, territories and localities of their laws and regulations as well as of the State Settlement Agreements discussed below (see State Settlement Agreements below).  Such enforcement efforts may adversely affect the ability of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees to market and sell regulated tobacco products in those states, territories and localities.\n\n- FDA's Comprehensive Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation: In July 2017, the FDA announced a 'Comprehensive Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation' ('Comprehensive Plan') designed to strike a balance between regulation and encouraging the development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes. Since then, the FDA has issued additional information about its Comprehensive Plan in response to concerns associated with the rise in the use of e-vapor products by youth and the potential youth appeal of flavored tobacco products (see Underage Access and Use of Certain Tobacco Products below). As part of the Comprehensive Plan, the FDA:\n- issued ANPRMs relating to potential product standards for nicotine in cigarettes, flavors in all tobacco products (including menthol in cigarettes and characterizing flavors in all cigars) and, for e-vapor products, to protect against known public health risks such as concerns about youth exposure to liquid nicotine;\n- took actions to restrict youth access to e-vapor products; and\n- reconsidered the processes used by the FDA to review certain reports and new product applications.\n- Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement: The FSPTCA permits the sale of tobacco products on the market as of February 15, 2007 and not subsequently modified ('Grandfathered Products') and new or modified products authorized through the PMTA, Substantial Equivalence ('SE') or SE Exemption pathways. Subsequent FDA rules also provide a Supplemental PMTA pathway designed to increase the efficiency of submission and review for modified versions of previously authorized products.\n\nThe FDA pre-market authorization enforcement policy varies based on product type and date of availability in the market, specifically:\n\n- Grandfathered Products are exempt from the pre-market authorization requirement;\n- cigarette and smokeless tobacco products that were modified or first introduced into the market between February 15, 2007 and March 22, 2011 are generally considered 'Provisional Products' for which SE reports were required to be filed by March 22, 2011. These reports must demonstrate that the product has the same characteristics as a product on the market as of February 15, 2007 or to a product previously determined to be substantially equivalent, or has different characteristics but does not raise different questions of public health; and\n- tobacco products that were first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches that are not Grandfathered Products, are generally products for which either an SE report or PMTA needed to be filed by September 9, 2020.",

PM USA and USSTC timely submitted SE reports for these Provisional Products and have received SE determinations on certain Provisional Products. Those products that were found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent (certain smokeless tobacco products) had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA's determinations; therefore, those determinations did not impact business results. PM USA and USSTC have other Provisional Products that continue to be subject to the FDA's pre-market review process. In the meantime, they can continue marketing these products unless the FDA determines that a specific Provisional Product is not substantially equivalent.\n\nIn addition, the FDA has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of Provisional Product SE reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further FDA review. PM USA and USSTC have Provisional Products included in this subset of products.\n\nWhile we believe PM USA's and USSTC's current Provisional Products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, we cannot predict how the FDA will ultimately apply law, regulation and guidance to their various SE reports. Should PM USA or USSTC receive unfavorable determinations on any SE reports currently pending with the FDA, we believe PM USA and USSTC can replace the vast majority of these product volumes with other FDA authorized products or with Preexisting Tobacco Products.\n\nCigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after March 22, 2011 are 'Non-Provisional Products' and must receive a marketing order from the FDA prior to being offered for sale. Marketing orders for Non-Provisional Products may be obtained by filing an SE report, a PMTA or using another pre-market pathway established by the FDA. PM USA and USSTC may not be able to obtain a marketing order for non-provisional products because the FDA may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval.\n\nProducts Regulated in 2016 : Manufacturers of products first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an SE report or a PMTA by the filing deadline of September 9, 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market. These products can remain on the market during FDA review through court-allowed, case-by-case discretion, so long as the report or application was timely filed with the FDA. In September 2022, the FDA represented that it had resolved more than 99% of the timely applications it had received, the vast majority of which were for e-vapor products and resulted in denials. A number of the denials are subject to challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers. For those products still under FDA review, it is uncertain when and for how long the FDA may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its case-by-case discretion. For products (new or modified) not on the market as of August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file an SE report or a PMTA and receive FDA authorization prior to marketing and selling the product.\n\nHelix submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020 and PMTAs for on! PLUS oral nicotine pouches in tobacco, mint and wintergreen flavors in June 2024. As of February 24, 2025, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or on! PLUS products.\n\nAs of February 24, 2025, Middleton has received marketing orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn October 2021, the FDA authorized the marketing and sale of four of USSTC's Verve oral nicotine products, including Green Mint and Blue Mint varieties, representing the first flavored product authorizations issued by the FDA for newly deemed innovative products. These products are not currently marketed or sold.\n\nIn March 2023, the FDA authorized USSTC to communicate a modified risk claim about its Copenhagen Classic Snuff MST product. This product is not currently marketed or sold. The authorized claim for Copenhagen Classic Snuff is 'IF YOU SMOKE, CONSIDER THIS: Switching completely to this product from cigarettes reduces risk of lung cancer.' In February 2025, USSTC filed a notice with the FDA withdrawing its modified risk application.\n\nAs a result of our June 2023 acquisition of NJOY Holdings, we gained full global ownership of NJOY's e-vapor product portfolio, including NJOY ACE , a pod-based e-vapor product with an MGO from the FDA, and NJOY DAILY , which also has an MGO. In June 2024, NJOY received MGOs with respect to two NJOY ACE menthol products and two NJOY DAILY menthol products. In May 2024, NJOY submitted a supplemental PMTA to the FDA to commercialize and market the NJOY ACE 2.0 device, which leverages Bluetooth connectivity to incorporate access restriction technology designed to prevent underage use by authenticating the user before unlocking the device. Also in May 2024, NJOY re-submitted PMTAs for blueberry and watermelon flavored pod-based e-vapor products that work exclusively with the Bluetooth -enabled NJOY ACE 2.0 device. These products previously received marketing denial orders ('MDOs') on the basis of FDA concerns regarding underage use. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nPost-Market Surveillance : Manufacturers that receive MGOs must adhere to the FDA post-market record keeping and reporting requirements, as detailed in market orders and in the final PMTA rule. The requirements include prior notification of marketing activities. The FDA may amend requirements of an MGO or withdraw the MGO based on this information if, among other reasons, it determines that the continued marketing of the products is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health.",

      "answer": "The reduction in appeal bonds posted by PM USA from $50 million in 2021 (as disclosed in MO's 2022 filing) likely freed up restricted cash that had been used as collateral, potentially improving Altria's liquidity position by 2024. However, the 2024 filing notes that PM USA remains involved in ongoing litigation, including e-vapor cases alleging RICO violations and other claims, which suggests that litigation risk exposure has not necessarily decreased. Additionally, the 2024 disclosures highlight material impairment risks in the e-vapor reporting unit, including a hypothetical 1% increase in the discount rate potentially triggering a $125 million impairment charge.

Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

      "answer": "In 2022, PM USA was still actively involved in multiple litigation cases, requiring it to post significant appeal bonds to secure stays of judgments pending appeals. By 2023, the total appeal bonds posted had decreased to $35 million, indicating that many of these cases had either been resolved or were nearing final stages. This reduction in appeal bonds reflects a broader decline in MO's litigation risk exposure, particularly in long-standing tobacco-related cases such as the Engle progeny judgments, which had totaled approximately $1 billion in payments by December 2023. Additionally, MO's guarantees of debt obligations through PM USA remained in place, but with a more stable financial outlook, suggesting a strategic shift toward reducing contingent liabilities and focusing on core financial commitments.",

(the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Purchase Obligations - We have entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

      "question": "How did the ITC's 2021 cease and desist order affecting PM USA's IQOS devices influence PM's 2023 strategic focus on reduced-risk products (RRPs) amid rising competitive pressures from BAT and Japan Tobacco?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PM USA was forced to remove IQOS devices from the market due to the ITC's cease and desist order effective November 29, 2021, which blocked the importation and sale of these products in the U.S. This regulatory enforcement directly disrupted PM's commercialization strategy for its heated tobacco products, which are central to its reduced-risk product (RRP) portfolio. By 2023, PM responded by intensifying its strategic focus on RRPs, emphasizing brand equity, adult consumer engagement, and R&D innovation in its competitive strategy. This shift was particularly important as PM faced growing competition from British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco Inc., both of which were actively introducing innovative products that threatened PM's market position. The absence of IQOS in the U.S. market during this period likely accelerated PM's global push to diversify and strengthen its RRP offerings elsewhere, as reflected in its increased emphasis on product innovation, adult smoker conversion, and communication about RRP characteristics in its 2023 filings.",

Our indemnitees include distributors, licensees, and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend, as well as to pay costs and some or all of judgments, if any, that may be entered against them. Pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. (\"Altria\") and PMI, PMI will indemnify Altria and Philip Morris USA Inc. (\"PM USA\"), a  U.S.  tobacco  subsidiary  of Altria,  for  tobacco  product  claims  based  in  substantial  part  on  products  manufactured  by  PMI  or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI.\n\nIt  is  possible  that  there  could  be  adverse  developments  in  pending  cases  against  us  and  our  subsidiaries.  An  unfavorable  outcome  or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.\n\nDamages claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in Brazil, Canada and Nigeria, range into the billions  of  U.S.  dollars.  The  variability  in  pleadings  in  multiple  jurisdictions,  together  with  the  actual  experience  of  management  in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. Much of the tobacco-related litigation is in its early stages, and litigation is subject to uncertainty.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nModifications to currently marketed products, including modifications that result from, for example, changes to the quantity of tobacco product(s) in a package, a manufacturer being unable to acquire ingredients or a supplier being unable to maintain the consistency required in ingredients, could trigger the FDA's pre-market or SE review processes. Through these processes, a manufacturer could receive (i) a 'not substantially equivalent' determination, (ii) a denial of a PMTA or (iii) a marketing order withdrawal by the FDA on one or more products, which would require the removal of the product or products from the market. Such actions could have a material adverse impact on the business and consolidated results of operations of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\nProvisional Products : Most cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by PM USA and USSTC are 'Provisional Products.' Altria's subsidiaries timely submitted SE reports for these Provisional Products. PM USA and USSTC have received SE determinations on certain Provisional Products. Those products that were found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent (certain smokeless tobacco products) had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA's determinations; therefore, those determinations did not impact business results. PM USA and USSTC have other Provisional Products that continue to be subject to the FDA's pre-market review process. In the meantime, they can continue marketing these products unless the FDA determines that a specific Provisional Product is not substantially equivalent.\n\nIn addition, the FDA has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of Provisional Product SE reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further FDA review. PM USA and USSTC have Provisional Products included in this subset of products.\n\nWhile Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies believe their current Provisional Products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, they cannot predict how the FDA will ultimately apply law, regulation and guidance to their various SE reports. Should Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies receive unfavorable determinations on any SE reports currently pending with the FDA, they believe they can replace the vast majority of their respective product volumes with other FDA authorized products or with Grandfathered Products.\n\nNon-Provisional Products : Cigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after March 22, 2011 are 'Non-Provisional Products' and must receive a marketing order from the FDA prior to being offered for sale. Marketing orders for Non-Provisional Products may be obtained by filing an SE report, PMTA or using another pre-market pathway established by the FDA. Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies may not be able to obtain a marketing order for non-provisional products because the FDA may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval.\n\nProducts Regulated in 2016 : Manufacturers of products first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an SE report or PMTA by the filing deadline of September 9, 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market. These products can remain on the market during FDA review through court-allowed, case-by-case discretion, so long as the report or application was timely filed with the FDA. Due to the large number of applications received by September 9, 2020, the FDA did not complete its review of all submitted applications by September 9, 2021, although it represents that it has made decisions on more than 98% of the applications, with most being marketing denial orders and a few marketing granted orders for tobacco flavor e-vapor products. A number of the marketing denial orders are subject to litigation challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers. For those products still under FDA review, it is uncertain when and for how long the FDA may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its case-by-case discretion. For products (new or modified) not on the market as of August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file an SE report or PMTA and receive FDA authorization prior to marketing and selling the product.\n\nHelix submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020. JUUL submitted PMTAs to the FDA for its e-vapor device and the related tobacco and menthol flavors in July 2020. As of February 22, 2022, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or JUUL products. In addition, as of February 22, 2022, Middleton has received market orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn December 2013, Altria's subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with PMI, including an agreement that grants Altria an exclusive right to commercialize certain of PMI's heated tobacco products in the United States, subject to FDA authorization of the applicable products. PMI submitted a PMTA and a MRTP application with the FDA for its electronically heated tobacco products comprising the IQOS Tobacco Heating System . The IQOS devices heat, but do not burn tobacco. In April 2019, the FDA authorized the PMTA for the IQOS Tobacco Heating System and in July 2020, the FDA authorized the marketing of this system as a MRTP with a reduced exposure claim. In December 2020, the FDA authorized the PMTA for IQOS 3, an updated version of the IQOS devices. The MRTP authorization for the original IQOS device currently does not apply to the IQOS 3 device. PMI submitted an MRTP application for the IQOS 3 device in March 2021, which is currently under review by the FDA.\n\nIn September 2021, in connection with a patent dispute, the ITC issued a cease and desist order, effective as of November 29, 2021, banning (i) the importation of the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and infringing components into the United States and (ii) the sale, marketing and distribution of such imported products in the United States. As a result, PM USA removed the products from the",

          "chunk_text": "\nOn June 11, 2021, PMI's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $7 billion, with target spending of $5 billion to $7 billion over a three-year period that commenced in July 2021. From July 22, 2021 through March 31, 2022, PMI repurchased 10.5 million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $1.0 billion. During the first three months of 2022, PMI repurchased 2.0 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $199 million. On May 11, 2022, we announced the suspension of the three-year share repurchase program following the recommended public offer to acquire the outstanding shares of Swedish Match from its shareholders. For further details, see Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures. Prior to the suspension of the program, PMI made no share repurchases during the second quarter of 2022. The three-year share repurchase program expired on July 21, 2024.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, 27,288,770 shares of common stock were reserved for stock awards under PMI's stock plans, and 250 million shares of preferred stock, without par value, were authorized but unissued. PMI currently has no plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.\n\n## Note 10.\n\n## Stock Plans:\n\nIn May 2022, PMI's shareholders approved the Philip Morris International Inc. 2022 Performance Incentive Plan (the '2022 Plan'). Under the 2022 Plan, PMI may grant to eligible employees restricted shares and restricted share units, performance-based cash incentive awards and performance-based equity awards. Up  to 25 million shares of PMI's common stock may be issued under the 2022 Plan. At December 31, 2024, shares available for grant under the 2022 Plan were 19,189,876.\n\nIn May 2017, PMI's shareholders approved the Philip Morris International Inc. 2017 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the '2017 Non-Employee Directors Plan'). A non-employee director is defined as a member of the PMI Board of Directors who is not a full-time employee of PMI or of any corporation in which PMI owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing at least 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote in the election of directors in such corporation. Up to 1 million shares of PMI common stock may be awarded under the 2017 Non-Employee Directors Plan. At December 31, 2024, shares available for grant under the plan were 855,920.\n\n## Restricted share unit (RSU) awards\n\nPMI may grant RSU awards to eligible employees; recipients may not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber such awards. Such awards are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. RSU awards generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. RSU awards do not carry voting rights, although they do earn dividend equivalents.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PM reported a significant increase in cigarette shipment volume in Turkey, which contributed to a rise in total market size by 8.2% compared to the previous year. However, this growth was partly offset by a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade in Turkey. By 2023, PM explicitly cited illicit trade as a key risk factor impacting its business, indicating that the earlier observed rise in illicit trade during 2022 had evolved into a persistent challenge affecting their operations and financial performance in 2023.",

        "Hop 1: PM(2022) \u2192 Turkey: PM saw a notable increase in cigarette shipment volume in Turkey, with the total market rising by 8.2% in 2022, partly driven by easing pandemic restrictions and increased tourism.",
        "Hop 2: Turkey \u2192 Illicit Trade: The 2022 report noted that this market growth was partially offset by a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade in Turkey.",
        "Hop 3: Illicit Trade \u2190 PM(2023): By 2023, PM explicitly listed illicit trade as a major challenge impacting its business, indicating that the earlier signs of illicit trade growth in Turkey had become a broader operational risk."

Excluding  the  unfavorable  impact  of  the  Saudi  Arabia  customs  assessments, unfavorable  currency  and  acquisitions,  net  revenues  increased  by  18.3%,  reflecting:  favorable  volume/mix,  primarily  driven  by  higher cigarette volume (predominantly in PMI Duty Free and Turkey, partly offset by the GCC and North Africa), higher heated tobacco unit volume (mainly in Egypt, Jordan and PMI Duty Free) and favorable cigarette mix (mainly in the GCC, PMI Duty Free and Turkey); and a favorable pricing variance, mainly driven by combustible pricing (primarily in Egypt and Turkey); partially offset by lower fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets, shown in \"Cost/Other\".\n\nOperating  income,  excluding  currency  and  acquisitions,  increased  by  23.8%,  mainly  reflecting:  a  favorable  pricing  variance;  favorable volume/mix, driven by the same factors and geographies as for net revenues noted above; and lower manufacturing costs (primarily related to combustible products); partly offset by the unfavorable impact of the Saudi Arabia customs assessments, as noted above for net revenues; higher marketing, administration and research costs; and lower fees for certain distribution rights, as noted above for net revenues.\n\nMiddle East &amp; Africa - Total Market, PMI Shipment Volume and Market Share Commentaries\n\nThe estimated total market in the Middle East &amp; Africa increased by 2.9% to 560.5 billion units, mainly driven by:\n\n- Algeria, up by 6.2%, primarily reflecting the impact on adult smoker average daily consumption of the easing of pandemic-related measures, partly offset by the impact of price increases;\n- Egypt, up by 8.8%, mainly reflecting a favorable comparison due to pandemic-related supply chain shortages for competitors' products in 2020, as well as the favorable impact of adult smoker in-switching to cigarettes (mainly in the low-tax tier) from other combustible tobacco products;\n- South Africa, up by 13.2%, primarily reflecting a favorable comparison versus the second and third quarters of 2020, in which the total market was impacted by the pandemic-related ban on all tobacco sales from March 27th through August 17th, partly offset by a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade stemming from the ban; and\n- Turkey,  up  by  8.2%,  mainly  reflecting  the  impact  on  adult  smoker  average  daily  consumption  of  the  easing  of  pandemic-related measures,  coupled  with  increased  in-bound  tourism  (particularly  by  Turkish  expatriates),  partially  offset  by  a  higher  estimated prevalence of illicit trade;\n\n## partly offset by\n\n- International Duty Free, down by 10.6%, primarily reflecting the impact of government travel restrictions and reduced passenger traffic since the start of the pandemic in March 2020; and\n- Tunisia, down by 15.6%, mainly reflecting higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade (primarily due to market disruptions impacting product availability and the impact of price increases in July 2021).\n\nOur Regional market share increased by 1.1 points to 23.1%.",

          "chunk_text": "## Governmental Investigations\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters, including tax, customs, antitrust, advertising, and labor practices. We describe certain pending matters in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies .\n\nIn November 2010, a World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") panel issued its decision in a dispute between the Philippines and Thailand, concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\") into Thailand. The decision concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the Thai government and created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports.  Thailand agreed to fully comply with the decision, but the Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision and commenced challenges at the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO Appellate Body is not operational, and the appeals by Thailand are suspended indefinitely. In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues and the countries have since agreed to seek the establishment of a bilateral consultative mechanism, with the goal of reaching a comprehensive settlement of their dispute, consistent with their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreements, as well as the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families in the country. We continue commercial activities in select locations where safety allows, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and supplies the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement. Production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended. On June 20, 2023, we announced the investment of $30 million in a new production facility in the Lviv region, in Western Ukraine. Preparatory work for the facility began in July 2023. The new production facility was completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and local production commenced in April 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our Ukrainian operations had approximately $0.6 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances.\n\nIn Russia, we are continuously assessing the evolving situation in the country. This includes regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. As of December 31, 2024, our Russian operations had approximately $2.7 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $1.0 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles).\n\nAdditionally, we hold a 23% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution B.V ., which was the holding company of JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), pursuant to Dutch law, PMI's distributor in Russia. On July 18, 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Trade filed a petition before the Arbitrazh Court of Moscow seeking the forced localization of JSC TK Megapolis. On December 5, 2024, JSC TK Megapolis registered the transfer of this equity interest to PMI affiliate ZAO Philip Morris Izhora. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. Related Parties - Equity Investments and Other and Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies.\n\nThese developments above have or may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in impairment charges.\n\nFor further details, see Item 1A. Risk Factors , Item 8, Note 4. War in Ukraine and the \"Trade Policy \" section of this Item 7.\n\n## Impact of Inflation on Our Business and Mitigation E fforts\n\nLike many other global companies, we have experienced inflationary pressures in 2022, 2023 and 2024, including: growing pressures on the cost of certain direct materials, wages, energy, transportation, and logistics as well as an increased cost of capital due to interest rate increases driven by the response to increased inflation. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact on cost of sales was approximately $580 million. In 2024, the impact on cost of sales was approximately 30% of the 2023 level, benefiting from lower prices for direct materials and utilities, despite continued pressure on tobacco leaf costs. In 2025, we expect certain inflationary elements such as direct materials and utilities to stabilize, with a moderate overall increase in inflationary pressures driven by tobacco leaf costs.\n\nInflationary impacts driven by higher wages have resulted from merit increases that reflect local inflation as we continuously evaluate our compensation and benefit offerings to be competitive with the current market. Increased transportation costs resulted from increased shipping rates for all modes of transportation (air, ocean and inland) due to ocean and air capacity constraints. Increases in",

      "question": "How did MDLZ's performance in the Gum & Candy category within the AMEA region change from 2022 to 2023, and what does this reveal about the company's regional product strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ generated $861 million in Gum & Candy revenue from the AMEA region, which represented 2.8% of the region's total net revenues. By 2023, this figure decreased to $893 million, despite a significant overall increase in MDLZ's global net revenues\u2014from $25.868 billion in 2022 to $36.016 billion in 2023. The relatively modest growth in AMEA's Gum & Candy segment compared to other product categories and regions suggests a potential strategic refocusing or underperformance in that specific market. This could indicate either a deliberate shift in investment toward higher-growth categories or challenges in maintaining growth within the Gum & Candy segment in the AMEA region.",

        "Hop 3: Gum & Candy \u2190 MDLZ(2023): In 2023, Gum & Candy revenue in AMEA slightly increased to $893 million, but remained flat as a proportion of total regional revenue amid broader growth in other categories."

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ's Cheese & Grocery segment contributed $437 million in net revenues from the AMEA region, representing 1.7% of the company's total net revenues. This indicates a relatively modest role in the broader revenue mix, especially compared to larger categories like Chocolate (8.3%) and Biscuits (7.8%) in the same region. By 2024, MDLZ continued to operate in the AMEA region as a key strategic segment, with regional management teams given responsibility for product categories and financial results. However, there is no explicit indication of a heightened strategic focus on Cheese & Grocery specifically in AMEA in 2024, suggesting that while the segment remains part of the regional portfolio, it may not be a primary driver of strategic growth initiatives. This implies a stable but not elevated strategic role for the Cheese & Grocery segment in AMEA over the two-year period.",

      "question": "How did the performance of Trademark Coca-Cola in EMEA evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this suggest about KO's market strategy and operational adjustments in the region?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Trademark Coca-Cola negatively impacted unit case volume in EMEA, contributing to a 1% decline in the region, which was part of a broader 2% overall decline in EMEA unit case volume. By 2024, Trademark Coca-Cola experienced a more moderate 1% decline in EMEA, while the region's overall unit case volume stabilized (even performance). This suggests that KO's market strategy and operational adjustments, such as focusing on other beverage categories like water, sports, coffee, and tea (which saw 4% growth in 2024), helped offset the continued softness in Trademark Coca-Cola. Additionally, KO's refranchising activities and balance sheet adjustments in EMEA (e.g., asset balances decreased from $1,153M in 2023 to $1,087M in 2024) reflect strategic realignments that may have contributed to stabilizing the region despite ongoing challenges with its flagship brand.",

Unit case volume in sparkling flavors was even. The operating segment reported growth in unit case volume of 2% in the Africa operating unit, offset by a decline of 2% in the Eurasia and Middle East operating unit. Unit case volume performance in the Europe operating unit was even.\n\nIn Latin America, unit case volume increased 3%, which included 5% growth in Trademark Coca-Cola and 2% growth in water, sports, coffee and tea, partially offset by a 1% decline in sparkling flavors. Unit case volume in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages was even. The operating segment's volume performance included 8% growth in Brazil and 2% growth in Mexico, partially offset by a decline of 12% in Argentina.\n\nUnit case volume in North America was even, which included 3% growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages and 1% growth in both Trademark Coca-Cola and sparkling flavors, offset by a 4% decline in water, sports, coffee and tea.\n\nIn Asia Pacific, unit case volume increased 1%, which included 4% growth in sparkling flavors and 3% growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, partially offset by a 4% decline in water, sports, coffee and tea. Unit case volume in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages was even. The operating segment reported growth in unit case volume of 7% in the India and Southwest Asia operating unit and 4% in both the ASEAN and South Pacific and the Japan and South Korea operating units, partially offset by a decline of 5% in the G reater China and Mongolia operating unit.\n\nUnit case volume for Global Ventures increased 2%, driven by growth in energy drinks, partially offset by a 6% decline in water, sports, coffee and tea. Unit case volume in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages was even.\n\nUnit case volume for Bottling Investments decreased 23%, which primarily reflects the impact of refranchising our bottling operations in the Philippines, Bangladesh and certain territories in India.\n\n## Concentrate Sales Volume\n\nIn 2024, worldwide concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 1% compared to 2023. The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for the operating segments were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PM faced significant challenges due to the FCTC-driven regulatory environment, including the risk of increasingly restrictive measures that could hinder the commercialization of RRPs, especially if adult consumer adoption was impacted or if governments imposed unfavorable tax treatments. By 2024, these concerns materialized in jurisdictions like Germany, where a new excise tax on heated tobacco products (HTPs) was upheld by the CJEU, directly increasing costs and reducing the competitiveness of PM's RRPs. Additionally, the 2023 WHO report and the 2024 CoP session reaffirmed the FCTC's stance toward regulating or restricting novel tobacco products, further constraining PM's market access and product positioning. This evolution demonstrates how FCTC-influenced policies increasingly shaped PM's regulatory and tax landscape, directly impacting their ability to scale RRPs in key markets.",

          "chunk_text": "## Risks Related to the Impact of COVID-19 on our Business\n\n## Our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position may be adversely impacted during the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created significant societal and economic disruption, and resulted in closures of stores, factories and offices, and restrictions on manufacturing, distribution and travel, all of which have and will continue to adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Our business continuity plans and other safeguards may not be effective to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.\n\nAn adequate supply chain for our RRP portfolio, including the supply of electronic devices, is important to our business. We work with four electronics manufacturing service providers for the supply of our Platform 1 and Platform 4 devices, and a small number of other providers for other products in our RRP portfolio and related accessories. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the operations of our two main electronic manufacturing service providers were temporarily suspended at different times. Even though these suspensions did not materially affect our operations, if one or more of these service providers were significantly constrained at the same time, the supply of the devices could be disrupted. Although we work closely with these service providers on monitoring their production capability and financial health, we cannot guarantee that they will remain capable of meeting their commitments, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; if they will not, the commercialization of our RRPs could be adversely affected. The production of our RRP portfolio requires various metals, and we believe that  there  is  an  adequate  supply  of  such  metals  in  the  world  markets  to  satisfy  our  current  and  anticipated  production  requirements. However, some components and materials necessary for the production of our RRPs, including those for the electronic devices, are obtained from  single  or  limited  sources,  and  can  be  subject  to  industry-wide  shortages  and  price  fluctuations.  While  we  were  successful  in maintaining adequate supply of such components and materials so far, we may not be able to secure such supply going forward, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; this could negatively impact the commercialization of our RRPs.\n\nSignificant risks to our business during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic also include our diminished ability to convert adult smokers to our RRPs, significant volume declines in our duty-free business and certain other key markets, disruptions or delays in our manufacturing and supply chain, including delays and increased costs in the shipment of parts to manufacture our products or for the products themselves, increased  currency  volatility,  and  delays  in  certain  cost  saving,  transformation  and  restructuring  initiatives.  Our  business  could  also  be adversely impacted if key personnel or a significant number of employees or business partners become unavailable due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The significant adverse impact of COVID-19 on the economic or political conditions in markets in which we operate could result in changes to the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for our mid-price or premium-price brands.\n\nContinuation of the pandemic could disrupt our access to the credit markets or increase our borrowing costs. Governments may temporarily be unable to focus on the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business. In addition, messaging about the potential negative impacts of the use of our products on COVID-19 risks may lead to increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the sale and use of our products, negatively impact demand for our products and the willingness of adult consumers to switch to our RRPs, and adversely impact our efforts to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs. All of the aforementioned impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, results of operations, revenues, cash flow and profitability.\n\nThe impact of these risks also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in general and specifically in the jurisdictions in which we operate, its recurrence in our key markets, actions taken to contain its spread and to mitigate its public health effects, and the ultimate economic consequences thereof.\n\n## Risks Related to Illicit Trade\n\n## We lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband, cross-border purchases, \"illicit whites,\" non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers, and counterfeiting of our Platform 1 device and heated tobacco units.\n\nLarge quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market. We believe that Marlboro is  the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity. In addition, our revenues are reduced  by  contraband,  legal  cross-border  purchases,  \"illicit  whites\"  and  non-tax-paid  volume  produced  by  local  manufacturers.  Our revenues and consumer satisfaction with our Platform 1 device and heated tobacco units may be adversely affected by counterfeit products that do not meet our product quality standards and scientific validation procedures.",

          "chunk_text": "If  nonetheless there is a significant usage of our products or competitive products among youth or non-smokers, even in situations over which  we  have  no  control,  our  credibility  may  suffer,  and  our  efforts  to  advocate  for  the  development  of  science-based  regulatory frameworks for the commercialization of RRPs may be significantly impacted.\n\nMoreover, the FDA's premarket tobacco product and modified risk tobacco product authorizations of a version of our Platform 1 product are subject to strict marketing, reporting and other requirements. Although we have received these product authorizations from the FDA, there is  no  guarantee that the product will remain authorized for sale in the U.S., particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or nonsmoker initiation.\n\n## The financial and business performance of our reduced-risk products is less predictable than our cigarette business.\n\nOur RRPs are novel products in a new category, and the pace at which adult smokers adopt them may vary, depending on the competitive, regulatory, fiscal and cultural environment, and other factors in a specific market. There may be periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for these products, the timing and drivers of which may be more difficult for us to predict versus our mature cigarette business. The impact of this lower predictability on our projected results for a specific period may be significant, particularly during the early  stages  of  this  new  product  category,  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  as  a  result  of  unpredictability  due  to  shortage  of  key components in our supply chain.\n\n## We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to differentiate reduced-risk products and cigarettes with respect to taxation.\n\nTo date, we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our RRPs are not cigarettes due to the absence of combustion, and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products, which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes. Nevertheless, we are unable to predict whether regulators will be issuing new regulations where RRP will be equally taxed  in  line  with  other  tobacco  products  such  as  ordinary  cigarettes.  However,  if  we  cease  to  be  successful  in  these  efforts,  RRP  unit margins may be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Consumption of tax-paid cigarettes continues to decline in many of our markets.\n\nThis decline is due to multiple factors, including increased taxes and pricing, governmental actions, the diminishing social acceptance of smoking  and  health  concerns,  competition,  continuing  economic  and  geopolitical  uncertainty,  and  the  continuing  prevalence  of  illicit products. These factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in Item 7, Business Environment . A continuous decline in the consumption of cigarettes could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\n\n## Cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. Significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. These tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors.\n\nTax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other combustible  tobacco  products,  or  disproportionately  affect  the  relative  retail  price  of  our  cigarette  brands  versus  cigarette  brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. Because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium-price cigarette category, tax regimes based  on  sales  price  can  place  us  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  in  certain  markets.  Furthermore,  our  volume  and  profitability  may  be adversely affected in these markets.\n\nIn addition, increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other combustible tobacco products and from the premium-price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products, or to illicit products such as contraband, counterfeit and \"illicit whites.\"\n\n## Our  business  faces  significant  governmental  action  aimed  at  increasing  regulatory  requirements  with  the  goal  of  reducing  or preventing the use of tobacco products.\n\nGovernmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volumes for our products in many of our markets, and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels  and  will  increase  down-trading  and  the  risk  of  counterfeiting,  contraband,  \"illicit  whites\"  and  legal  cross-border  purchases. Significant regulatory developments will continue to take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the \"FCTC\"). Since it came into force in 2005, the FCTC has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the  marketing  and  sale  of  tobacco  products  to  adult  smokers.  Regulatory  initiatives  that  have  been  proposed,  introduced  or  enacted  by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions include:\n\n- restrictions on or licensing of outlets permitted to sell cigarettes;\n- the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;",

          "chunk_text": "On March 14, 2024, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \"CJEU\") ruled that the G erman fiscal regulation imposing an additional excise tax on HTPs does not contravene EU law. Fiscal Court in Dusseldorf (the \"FCD\") had previously referred that question to the CJEU. On May 21, 2024, the FCD delivered its judgement and dismissed our local affiliate's, f6 Cigarettenfabrik G mbH &amp; Co.KG , (\"PM G ermany\") claim. PM G ermany filed a notice of appeal to the Federal Fiscal Court on June 19, 2024.\n\n## Legislative and Regulatory Environment\n\nThe tobacco industry operates in a highly regulated environment. The well-known risks of smoking have led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise  tax es  on  cigarettes.  The  regulatory  landscape  for  novel  nicotine-containing  products  is  inconsistent  and  evolving  but  is,  in  some  instances,  even  more restrictive.\n\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the World Health Organization's (the \"WHO\") Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the \"FCTC\"), which entered into force in 2005. The main objective of the FCTC is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union (\"EU\") are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others. The FCTC governing body, the Conference of the Parties ('CoP'), has also adopted non-binding guidelines and policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty. In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for more scientific assessment and improved reporting to define policy on heated tobacco products. Similar to its previous policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\n\nThe WHO study group on tobacco product regulation published their ninth report on the scientific basis of tobacco product regulation in August 2023. The report is based on a review of scientific evidence related to novel and emerging nicotine and tobacco products, such as electronic nicotine delivery systems (\"ENDS\"), electronic non-nicotine delivery systems and HTPs. The report concludes by making a number of policy recommendations on HTPs and ENDS that, if implemented, could restrict both the availability of these products and the access to accurate information about them.\n\nThe Tenth Session of the CoP took place in February 2024. No new decisions or policy recommendations on novel and emerging tobacco products were adopted. Specific  G uidelines  were  adopted  to  address  cross-border  Tobacco  Advertising,  Promotion,  and  Sponsorship  ('TAPS')  and  the  depiction  of  tobacco  in entertainment media. The Eleventh session of the CoP is currently scheduled to take place in November 2025. The WHO's reports and other FCTC guidelines or recommendations are not binding on the WHO Member States or on parties to the FCTC.\n\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion  people  who  smoke  cigarettes  today,  but  how  fast,  and  within  what  regulatory  framework  to  max imize  their  adoption  by  adult  smokers  while  minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that are based on a continuum of risk where non-combustible products fall below combustible cigarettes. And we believe that regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking.\n\nProduct regulation should include measures that encourage and accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would otherwise continue smoking cigarettes to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such alternatives to enable them to make informed decisions and by applying uniform product standards to enable manufacturers to demonstrate the reduction in harmful and potentially harmful constituents, as well as the absence of combustion.\n\nRegulation should also include specific rules for ingredients, labeling and consumer communication, and should ensure that the public is informed about the health risks of all combustible and non-combustible tobacco and nicotine-containing products. Importantly, regulation must include measures designed to prevent initiation by youth and non-smokers. We support mandated accurate and factual health warnings on packaging, minimum age laws, restrictions on advertising, and smoking restrictions in public spaces. We also support regulatory measures that help reduce illicit trade. At the same time, we oppose excessive or prohibitive regulations that may prevent adult smokers, who would otherwise continue smoking, from accessing and switching to SFPs or trigger unintended consequences such as illicit trade.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Coca-Cola reported multiple international tax charges totaling $375 million (3.0% impact on effective tax rate) and $199 million (1.9% impact) related to changes in tax laws and uncertain tax positions across foreign jurisdictions. These charges were influenced by the Tax Reform Act, particularly the GILTI provisions, which required Coca-Cola to include in U.S. taxable income the excess earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, including those in the Philippines. In 2021, the Philippines enacted a corporate income tax rate reduction, which was noted in PM_10k_2022 as a factor that favorably impacted effective tax rates for multinational firms like Coca-Cola. However, by 2024, despite this lower tax rate, Coca-Cola refranchised its bottling operations in the Philippines, likely as a strategic move to reduce exposure to ongoing international tax complexities and GILTI-related liabilities. This refranchising was part of a broader Asia Pacific restructuring, indicating a shift in Coca-Cola's operational model in response to evolving international tax environments.",

Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any additional outside basis differences in these entities is not practicable.\n\nThe Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ('GILTI') provisions of the Tax Reform Act require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return each foreign subsidiary's earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary's tangible assets. An accounting policy election is available to either account for the tax effects of GILTI in the period that is subject to such taxes or to provide deferred taxes for book and tax basis differences that upon reversal may be subject to such taxes. We have elected to account for the tax effects of these provisions in the period that is subject to such tax and the impact is reflected in our full year provision.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in all applicable jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal jurisdiction, U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions. U.S. tax authorities have completed their federal income tax examinations for all years prior to 2007. With respect to U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions, with limited exceptions, the Company and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to 2006. For U.S. federal and state tax purposes, the net operating losses and tax credit carryovers acquired in connection with our acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.'s former North America business that were generated from the years of 1990 through 2010 are subject to adjustments until the year in which they are actually utilized is no longer subject to examination. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company believes that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been provided for in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance.",

          "chunk_text": "We generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as 'structural changes,' which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company's unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's acquisitions and divestitures.\n\n'Acquired brands' refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.\n\n'Licensed brands' refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.\n\nIn January 2023, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Vietnam. The impact of this refranchising has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments. In January, February and December 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in certain territories in India, and in February 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Bangladesh and the Philippines. The impact of each of these refranchisings has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments.\n\nIn May 2023, the Company acquired certain brands in Asia Pacific. The impact of acquiring these brands has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Asia Pacific operating segment.\n\n## Beverage Volume\n\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, 'unit case' means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and 'unit case volume' means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1. Business.\n\n## General Development of Business\n\n## General\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a V irginia holding company incorporated in 1987. In March 2008, we became a U.S. public company listed on the New Y ork Stock Exchange and subject to the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). We are a leading international tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future and evolving our portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. Our current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, we have invested over $14 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This investment includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as postmarket studies. In November 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB (\"Swedish Match\") - a leader in oral nicotine delivery - creating a global smoke-free combination led by the companies' IQOS and ZYN brands. Following a robust science-based review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") has authorized the marketing of Swedish Match's General snus and ZYN nicotine pouches and versions of PMI's IQOS devices and consumables - the first-ever such authorizations in their respective categories. V ersions of IQOS devices and consumables and General snus also obtained the first-ever Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\") authorizations from the FDA. We describe the MRTP orders in more detail in the \"Business Environment\" section of Item 7. Management' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .\n\nThrough our acquisition of Swedish Match in 2022, with its leading nicotine pouch franchise in the U.S. under the ZYN brand name, we acquired a market leader in oral nicotine delivery with a significant presence in the United States market. The Swedish Match acquisition has been a key milestone in PMI's transformation to becoming a smoke-free company. The Swedish Match product portfolio is complementary to our existing portfolio, permitting us to bring together a leading oral nicotine product with the leading heat-not-burn product. By joining forces with Swedish Match, we expect to accelerate the achievement of our joint smoke-free ambitions, switching more adults who would otherwise continue to smoke cigarettes to better alternatives faster than either company could achieve separately.\n\nIn 2022, we reached an agreement with Altria G roup, Inc. to end our commercial relationship in the U.S. covering IQOS as of April 30, 2024. PMI now holds the full rights to commercialize IQOS in the U.S. For further details, see Item 8, Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures .\n\nIn 2021, we began our long-term growth ambitions beyond nicotine in wellness and healthcare given our strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences. Our Wellness and Healthcare business strategy currently focuses on developing and commercializing oral and inhaled consumer health and wellness offerings and inhaled  prescription  products  for  therapy  areas  that  include  pain  management  and  cardiovascular  emergencies.  This  includes  medical  and  pharmaceutical cannabinoids,  and  non-recreational  cannabinoid  products  (including  CBD),  in  line  with  applicable  regulatory  requirements,  though  any  revenue  related  to cannabinoids is expected to be negligible in the near to medium term.\n\nSmoke-Free Business (\"SFB') is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its smoke-free products. SFB also includes wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories, such as lighters and matches.\n\nSmoke-free products (also referred to herein as \"SFPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its products that provide nicotine without combusting tobacco, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral smokeless, and that therefore generate far lower levels of harmful chemicals. As such, these products have the potential to present less risk of harm versus continued smoking.\n\nWe have a range of SFPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Our smoke-free products are designed for, and directed toward, current adult smokers and adult users of nicotine-containing products. We put significant effort to restrict access of our products from non-smokers and youth. We believe regulation must include measures designed to prevent youth initiation; and we also support and engage with relevant authorities to seek sensible regulation of flavors, mandated health warnings and minimum age laws.\n\nOur IQOS smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products. It uses a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTUs\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our BLENDS , DELIA , HEETS , HEETS Creations (defined collectively as \" HEETS \"), SENTIA , TEREA, TEREA CRAFTED and TEREA Dimensions, as well\n\n## PART I",

As of December 31, 2024, our smoke-free products were available for sale in 95 markets. With regard to nicotine pouches, we increased our presence to 37 markets.\n\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 170 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by Marlboro ,  the  world's  best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 40% of our total 2024 cigarette shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament . Our other leading international cigarette brands are Chesterfield, L&amp;M , and Philip Morris.

Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions that are otherwise compliant with law, including governmental capital and foreign currency exchange controls.\n\n## Description of Business\n\nFollowing the combination and the progress in 2023 toward the integration of the Swedish Match business into PMI's existing regional structure, PMI updated in January 2024 its segment reporting by including the former Swedish Match segment results into the four existing geographical segments. Our four geographical segments are as follows:\n\n- Europe Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe;\n- South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA\") is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia;\n- East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU &amp; PMI DF\") is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia &amp; Australia; and\n- Americas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.\n\nOur Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&amp;H\") segment, which includes the operating results of our Wellness and Healthcare business, remained unchanged in 2024.\n\nFollowing the sale of V ectura G roup Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining Wellness &amp; Healthcare results in the Europe segment. In addition, we will be renaming our 'PMI Duty Free' business to 'PMI G lobal Travel Retail' effective in the first quarter of 2025. As a result of this change, PMI's segment that includes our duty free business will be renamed East Asia, Australia &amp; PMI G lobal Travel Retail ('EA, AU &amp; PMI GTR').  As of the first quarter of 2025, our reporting will reflect these changes.\n\nOur total shipment volume, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, increased by 2.5% in 2024 to 756.6 billion units, with shipment volume of heated tobacco units reaching 139.7 billion units in 2024, up from 125.3 billion units in 2023.

As described in Note 1, management performs an annual impairment test of its indefinite-lived intang ible assets, including trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill. Each impairment test may be qualitative or quantitative. Management performs their annual impairment tests as of June 29, 2024, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. The Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $760 million duringthe year ended December 31, 2024 related to their BodyArmor trademark in North America.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|                                          | Auditing the valuation of trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill involved complex judgment due to the sig nificant estimation required in determining the fair value of the trademarks with indefinite lives and related reporting units with goodwill, respectively. Specifically, the fair value estimates were sensitive to sig nificant assumptions about future market and economic conditions. Sig nificant assumptions used in the Company's fair value estimates included sales volume, pricing , royalty rates, long-termgrowth rates, and discount rates, as applicable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| HowWeAddressed the Matter in Our Audit   | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the desig n, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's interim review of impairment indicators, interim impairment test, and annual impairment tests for trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill. For example, we tested management's risk assessment process to determine whether to perform a quantitative or qualitative test, management's control over the evaluation of interimimpairment indicators, and management's review controls over the valuation models and underlyingassumptions used to develop such estimates. For impairment tests of reportingunits with goodwill, wealso tested controls over the determination of the carryingvalue of the reportingunits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|                                          | We tested the trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill based on our risk assessments. Our audit procedures included, among others, comparing sig nificant judgmental inputs to observable third party and industry sources, considering other observable market transactions, and evaluating the reasonableness of management's projected financial information by comparing to third party industry projections, third party economic growth projections, and other internal and external data. Weperformed sensitivity analyses of certain sig nificant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value of the trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill and assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates. In addition, weinvolved specialists to assist in our evaluation of certain sig nificant assumptions used in the Company's valuation model. Wealso assessed the Company's related disclosures of its valuation of trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill. |\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Altria Group (MO) relied on PM USA to guarantee its obligations under debt securities, credit agreements, and commercial paper programs, with the risk that these guarantees could be voided under state fraudulent transfer laws if PM USA was deemed insolvent or received less than fair consideration. By 2024, the structure remained unchanged, with the same legal conditions applying under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, meaning that MO's exposure to these risks did not decrease. The continued reliance on PM USA's guarantees without structural modifications meant that the company's vulnerability to potential voiding of these guarantees under fraudulent transfer claims remained consistent across both years.",

(the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n\nPM USA (the 'Guarantor'), which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

      "question": "How did the constraints of the 2006 RICO Order, which PM USA remained subject to in 2022, influence PMI's ability to commercialize Platform 1 in the U.S. following the 2022 Agreement, and how did this legal context evolve in 2023 as PMI prepared to assume full commercial rights?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PM USA was still bound by the 2006 RICO Order, which restricted the transfer of cigarette brands or business elements without the transferee submitting to court jurisdiction and being subject to the Order. This legal constraint became relevant when PMI entered into the 2022 Agreement with Altria to assume full commercial rights for Platform 1 in the U.S. by April 30, 2024. The U.S. government indicated that PMI would need to submit to the 2006 Order before the transaction could proceed, potentially delaying or altering the commercialization strategy. By 2023, this concern remained unresolved, with PMI asserting that the provisions cited by the government were inapplicable to the agreement, and exploring paths to minimize any potential impact. The evolution of this legal dynamic directly influenced PMI's strategic planning and timeline for expanding Platform 1, a smoke-free product representing a significant portion of its R&D investment (99% of total R&D spend in 2023), in the world's largest smoke-free market.",

        "Hop 1: PM(2022) \u2192 PM USA: PM USA was subject to the 2006 RICO Order, which imposed restrictions on transferring cigarette brands or business elements.",

        "Hop 3: 2006 Order \u2190 PM(2023): By 2023, the legal uncertainty remained, with PMI contesting the applicability of the Order to the Platform 1 transaction and preparing contingency plans to ensure the agreement could proceed without disruption."

For additional information, see Note 13. Benefit Plans for disclosures related to PMI's pension and other benefits, Note 15. Financial Instruments for disclosures related to derivative financial instruments and Note 20. Deconsolidation of RBH for disclosures related to the deconsolidation of RBH.\n\n## Note 17.\n\n## Contingencies:\n\n## Tobacco-Related Litigation\n\nLegal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us, and/or our subsidiaries, and/or our indemnitees in various jurisdictions. Our indemnitees include distributors, licensees, and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend, as well as to pay costs and some or all of judgments, if any, that may be entered against them. Pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. (\"Altria\") and PMI, PMI will indemnify Altria and Philip Morris USA Inc. (\"PM USA\"), a  U.S.  tobacco  subsidiary  of Altria,  for  tobacco  product  claims  based  in  substantial  part  on  products  manufactured  by  PMI  or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI.\n\nIt  is  possible  that  there  could  be  adverse  developments  in  pending  cases  against  us  and  our  subsidiaries.  An  unfavorable  outcome  or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.\n\nDamages claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in Brazil, Canada and Nigeria, range into the billions  of  U.S.  dollars.  The  variability  in  pleadings  in  multiple  jurisdictions,  together  with  the  actual  experience  of  management  in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. Much of the tobacco-related litigation is in its early stages, and litigation is subject to uncertainty. However, as discussed below, we have to date been largely successful in defending tobacco-related litigation.",

      "question": "How did the evolution of FCTC-driven advertising bans between 2022 and 2024 affect PM's regulatory exposure in the EU, particularly with the extension of flavor bans to heated tobacco products in 2023?",
      "answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, PM faced increasing regulatory pressure stemming from FCTC-driven advertising bans and expanded flavor restrictions, particularly in the EU. In 2022, the FCTC's longstanding call for advertising bans was already in effect across many markets, including restrictions on radio, TV, print, and digital platforms. By 2024, this framework had evolved to include more stringent product-specific regulations, such as the EU's delegated directive in November 2022 that extended flavor bans to heated tobacco products, effective October 2023. This marked a significant regulatory shift, as heated tobacco products had previously been exempted from flavor restrictions. PM anticipated short-term volatility but observed limited long-term impact on shipment volumes, aligning with past experiences in similar markets. However, the broader FCTC influence, including the CoP's policy recommendations and WHO's scientific assessments in 2023, signaled a continued tightening of regulatory conditions, especially around product design and consumer communication. This evolution increased PM's regulatory exposure, particularly in markets where the FCTC's non-binding guidelines were translated into national law.",

          "chunk_text": "Some countries have adopted, or are considering adopting, packaging restrictions that could have an impact similar to plain packaging. Examples  of  such  restrictions  include  standardizing  the  shape  and  size  of  packages,  prohibiting  certain  colors  or  the  use  of  certain descriptive phrases on packaging, and requiring very large graphic health warnings that leave little space for branding.\n\nRestrictions and Bans on the Use of Ingredients: The WHO and others in the public health community have recommended restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in tobacco products, including menthol. Broad restrictions and ingredient bans would require us to reformulate our American blend tobacco products and could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term. In many countries, menthol bans would eliminate the entire category of mentholated tobacco products. The European Union banned cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco products with characterizing flavors. Other tobacco products, including heated tobacco products, are exempted from this flavor ban. The EU Commission is required to withdraw this exemption for a particular product category if it determines that there is a substantial change of circumstances, such as a significant increase of EU-wide sales volumes in such product category. Other countries may follow the EU's approach. Turkey banned menthol as of May 2020. Broader ingredient bans have been adopted by Brazil and Canada.\n\nBans  on  Display  of  Tobacco  Products  at  Retail: In  a  number  of  our  markets,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  Australia  and  Russia, governments have banned the display of tobacco products at the point of sale. Other countries are considering similar bans.\n\nBans and Restrictions on Advertising, Marketing, Promotions and Sponsorships: For many years, the FCTC has called for, and countries have  imposed,  partial  or  total  bans  on  tobacco  advertising,  marketing,  promotions  and  sponsorships,  including  bans  and  restrictions  on advertising on radio and television, in print and on the Internet. The FCTC's non-binding guidelines recommend that governments prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers.\n\nRestrictions  on  Product  Design: Some  members  of  the  public  health  community  are  calling  for  the  further  standardization  of  tobacco products by requiring, for example, that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter, which would amount to a ban on slim cigarettes, or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs. In addition, at its meeting in November 2016, the CoP adopted nonbinding guidelines recommending that countries regulate product design features that increase the attractiveness of tobacco products, such as the diameter of cigarettes and the use of flavor capsules.\n\nRestrictions on Public Smoking and Use of Nicotine-Containing Products in Public: The pace and scope of restrictions on the use of our products  have  increased  significantly  in  most  of  our  markets.  Many  countries  around  the  world  have  adopted,  or  are  likely  to  adopt, regulations  that  restrict  or  ban  smoking  and  use  of  nicotine-containing  products  in  public  and/or  work  places,  restaurants,  bars  and nightclubs.  Some  public  health  groups  have  called  for,  and  some  countries,  regional  governments  and  municipalities  have  adopted  or proposed, bans on smoking in outdoor places, as well as bans on smoking in cars (typically, when minors are present) and private homes.\n\nOther Regulatory Issues: Some  regulators  are  considering,  or  in  some  cases  have  adopted,  regulatory  measures  designed  to  reduce  the supply of tobacco products. These include regulations intended to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco products by, for example, reducing the overall number of tobacco retail licenses available or banning the sale of tobacco products within specified distances of certain public facilities. In addition, South Africa banned the sale of tobacco products, e-cigarettes, and electronic devices that heat tobacco for several months during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ban, which was lifted on August 17, 2020, resulted in a significant increase of illicit trade of tobacco products.\n\nIn a limited number of markets, most notably Japan, we are dependent on governmental approvals that may limit our pricing flexibility.\n\nThe  EU  Single-Use  Plastics  Directive,  which  will  require  tobacco  manufacturers  and  importers  to  cover  the  costs  of  public  collection systems for tobacco product filters, under Extended Producer Responsibility (\"EPR\") schemes, entered into force on July 2, 2019. To date, some member states transposed the Directive into national legislation. We expect remaining member states to transpose the EU Single-Use Plastics Directive into national legislation including EPR schemes by January 2023. While we cannot predict the impact of this initiative on our business at this time, we are monitoring developments in this area.\n\nIllicit  Trade: Illicit  tobacco  trade  creates  a  cheap  and  unregulated  supply  of  tobacco  products,  undermines  efforts  to  reduce  smoking prevalence, especially among youth, damages legitimate businesses and intellectual property rights, stimulates organized crime, increases corruption and reduces government tax revenue. We generally estimate that, excluding China and the U.S., illicit trade may account for as much as 12% of global cigarette consumption; this includes counterfeit, contraband and the persistent problem of 'illicit whites,' which are cigarettes legally produced in one jurisdiction for the sole purpose of being exported and illegally sold in another jurisdiction where they have no legitimate market. Currently, we estimate that illicit trade in the European Union accounted for approximately 8% of total cigarette consumption in 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "The EU banned cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco products with characterizing flavors. Other tobacco products are currently exempted under EU TPD from this characterizing flavor ban. This was also the case for heated tobacco products until November 23, 2022, when the EU Commission published a delegated directive that eliminated this ex emption. All EU Member States were required to apply the delegated directive as of October 23, 2023, which bans the use of characterizing flavors in heated tobacco products, impacting a significant proportion of our SFP products currently sold in the EU. Currently, all but six EU Member States have transposed this directive, withdrawing the heated tobacco product exemption from the characterizing flavor ban into national law. Based on high consumer switching to nonflavored products in reaction to past bans on flavors in other categories and markets, we anticipated that, while short-term volatility would be possible, the ban's impact on our shipment volumes in the EU would be relatively limited in the near term. To date, our experience is consistent with this expectation. There has been some short-term disruption in countries that have implemented the ban, but the impact has generally been limited in time and magnitude. Nevertheless, it remains possible that the impact in countries that have yet to implement the ban could be more significant in duration or magnitude. But our fundamental view remains that we do not expect a meaningful long-term change in the structural growth of the category. We will continue to actively monitor relevant developments in the EU market, including from an illicit trade standpoint.\n\nOther countries may follow the EU's approach toward tobacco product ingredients. Turkey banned menthol as of May 2020. Broader ingredient bans have been adopted by Brazil and Canada. In the U.S., certain states and localities have adopted flavor bans that apply to SFPs, including certain ZYN varieties.\n\nBans on Display of Tobacco Products at Retail : In a number of our markets, including, but not limited to, Australia, Canada and Russia, governments have banned the display of tobacco products at the point of sale.

The FCTC's non-binding guidelines recommend that governments prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers.\n\nProduct  Standards  and  Restrictions  on  Product  Design :  In  some  countries,  including  in  the  EU,  cigarettes  are  subject  to  testing,  disclosure  and  mandatory emissions limits for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents.\n\nSome members of the public health community are calling for the further standardization of tobacco products by requiring, for example, that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter, which would result in a ban on slim cigarettes, or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs. In addition, at its meeting in November 2016, the CoP adopted non-binding guidelines recommending that countries regulate product design features that increase the attractiveness of tobacco products, such as the diameter of cigarettes and the use of flavor capsules.\n\nCurrently, national standards in certain countries set minimum quality and safety requirements for heat-not-burn products with technical heat-not-burn specifications and/or methods for demonstrating the absence of combustion. These standards are mandatory in Armenia, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia,  Tajikistan,  Tunisia,  the  UAE  and  Uzbekistan,  and  voluntary  in Algeria, Azerbaijan,  Colombia,  Costa  Rica,  Dominican  Republic,  Indonesia,  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, Russia, South Africa, V ietnam, the U.K. and Ukraine.In Japan, a voluntary standard sets minimum safety requirements for tobacco heating devices.\n\nFor e-V apor products, national standards setting minimum quality and safety requirements have been adopted in several markets. These standards are mandatory in Armenia, Bahrain, China, Egypt, Jordan, New Zealand, the Philippines, Russia, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia and Tajikistan, and voluntary in Azerbaijan, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, France, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the Philippines, Russia, the U.K., and Ukraine.\n\nCurrently, industry standards setting minimum quality and safety requirements for modern oral nicotine pouches have been adopted in Armenia, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Pakistan, Sweden, the U.K., and Ukraine. These standards are voluntary.\n\nWe expect other governments to consider similar product standards for all novel tobacco and nicotine-containing products and encourage making them mandatory.\n\nRestrictions on Public Smoking and Use of Nicotine-Containing Products in Public : The pace and scope of restrictions on the use of our products have increased significantly in most of our markets.

          "chunk_text": "On March 14, 2024, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \"CJEU\") ruled that the G erman fiscal regulation imposing an additional excise tax on HTPs does not contravene EU law. Fiscal Court in Dusseldorf (the \"FCD\") had previously referred that question to the CJEU. On May 21, 2024, the FCD delivered its judgement and dismissed our local affiliate's, f6 Cigarettenfabrik G mbH &amp; Co.KG , (\"PM G ermany\") claim. PM G ermany filed a notice of appeal to the Federal Fiscal Court on June 19, 2024.\n\n## Legislative and Regulatory Environment\n\nThe tobacco industry operates in a highly regulated environment. The well-known risks of smoking have led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise  tax es  on  cigarettes.  The  regulatory  landscape  for  novel  nicotine-containing  products  is  inconsistent  and  evolving  but  is,  in  some  instances,  even  more restrictive.\n\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the World Health Organization's (the \"WHO\") Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the \"FCTC\"), which entered into force in 2005. The main objective of the FCTC is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union (\"EU\") are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others. The FCTC governing body, the Conference of the Parties ('CoP'), has also adopted non-binding guidelines and policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty. In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for more scientific assessment and improved reporting to define policy on heated tobacco products. Similar to its previous policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\n\nThe WHO study group on tobacco product regulation published their ninth report on the scientific basis of tobacco product regulation in August 2023. The report is based on a review of scientific evidence related to novel and emerging nicotine and tobacco products, such as electronic nicotine delivery systems (\"ENDS\"), electronic non-nicotine delivery systems and HTPs. The report concludes by making a number of policy recommendations on HTPs and ENDS that, if implemented, could restrict both the availability of these products and the access to accurate information about them.\n\nThe Tenth Session of the CoP took place in February 2024. No new decisions or policy recommendations on novel and emerging tobacco products were adopted. Specific  G uidelines  were  adopted  to  address  cross-border  Tobacco  Advertising,  Promotion,  and  Sponsorship  ('TAPS')  and  the  depiction  of  tobacco  in entertainment media. The Eleventh session of the CoP is currently scheduled to take place in November 2025. The WHO's reports and other FCTC guidelines or recommendations are not binding on the WHO Member States or on parties to the FCTC.\n\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion  people  who  smoke  cigarettes  today,  but  how  fast,  and  within  what  regulatory  framework  to  max imize  their  adoption  by  adult  smokers  while  minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that are based on a continuum of risk where non-combustible products fall below combustible cigarettes. And we believe that regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking.\n\nProduct regulation should include measures that encourage and accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would otherwise continue smoking cigarettes to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such alternatives to enable them to make informed decisions and by applying uniform product standards to enable manufacturers to demonstrate the reduction in harmful and potentially harmful constituents, as well as the absence of combustion.\n\nRegulation should also include specific rules for ingredients, labeling and consumer communication, and should ensure that the public is informed about the health risks of all combustible and non-combustible tobacco and nicotine-containing products. Importantly, regulation must include measures designed to prevent initiation by youth and non-smokers. We support mandated accurate and factual health warnings on packaging, minimum age laws, restrictions on advertising, and smoking restrictions in public spaces. We also support regulatory measures that help reduce illicit trade. At the same time, we oppose excessive or prohibitive regulations that may prevent adult smokers, who would otherwise continue smoking, from accessing and switching to SFPs or trigger unintended consequences such as illicit trade.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Altria formed the joint venture Horizon with JTIUH, retaining a 75% economic interest to commercialize heated tobacco stick (HTS) products in the U.S., signaling early-stage investment in smoke-free alternatives. By 2024, Horizon had evolved into a majority-owned joint venture under Altria\u2019s broader 'Moving Beyond Smoking' strategy, reflecting a deeper integration of HTS products into Altria\u2019s smoke-free portfolio. This shift aligns with Altria\u2019s strategic emphasis on transitioning adult smokers to potentially less harmful products, as evidenced by the inclusion of Horizon alongside other smoke-free subsidiaries like NJOY and Helix. The increased prominence of Horizon in 2024 suggests that Altria is consolidating control over its next-generation tobacco products to drive long-term growth in the smoke-free category.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PEP reported $632 million in Fixed Income Commingled Funds as part of their International Plan Assets, which decreased to $526 million in 2023. This reduction was part of a broader trend where total International Plan Assets increased from $3,195 million in 2022 to $3,528 million in 2023, despite declines in fixed income exposure. The decrease in Fixed Income Commingled Funds was offset by increases in other asset categories, particularly Government Securities, which rose from $736 million in 2022 to $1,207 million in 2023. This reflects a strategic rebalancing of PEP's International Plan Assets away from fixed income commingled instruments toward other income-generating assets.",

      "question": "How did MO's 2022 retail share performance in oral nicotine pouches through Helix relate to the FDA's PMTA review process, and how did this impact MO's regulatory risk exposure in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MO's subsidiary Helix achieved unconstrained manufacturing capacity for on! nicotine pouches, which grew to a 3.9% U.S. retail share in Q4 2021, up from 1.1% in Q4 2020. However, Helix had submitted PMTAs for on! in May 2020, and as of February 2022, the FDA had not yet issued marketing decisions. This regulatory uncertainty carried into 2023, where MO noted that the FDA had still not issued marketing orders for any on! products as of February 2024, leaving them in a state of prolonged regulatory limbo. This lack of resolution increased MO's exposure to potential product removals or restrictions, especially as the FDA had already issued over 99% of decisions on similar 2016-regulated products, mostly denials. Thus, MO's 2022 market position through Helix became a liability in 2023 due to unresolved PMTAs and heightened regulatory risk.",

          "chunk_text": "\nNote: The oral tobacco products segment retail share results exclude international volume, which is currently not material. Retail share results for oral tobacco products are based on data from IRI InfoScan, a tracking service that uses a sample of stores to project market share and depict share trends. This service tracks sales in the food, drug, mass merchandisers, convenience, military, dollar store and club trade classes on the number of cans and packs sold. Oral tobacco products is defined by IRI as MST, snus and oral nicotine pouches. New types of oral tobacco products, as well as new packaging configurations of existing oral tobacco products, may or may not be equivalent to existing MST products on a can-for-can basis. For example, one pack of snus or one can of oral nicotine pouches, irrespective of the number of pouches in the pack or can, is assumed to be equivalent to one can of MST. Because this service represents retail share performance only in key trade channels, it should not be considered a precise measurement of actual retail share. It is IRI's standard practice to periodically refresh its InfoScan services, which could restate retail share results that were previously released in this service.\n\nFor a discussion of volume trends and factors that impact volume and retail share performance, see Tobacco Space - Business Environment above.\n\n## 2021 Compared with 2020\n\nThe oral tobacco products segment's reported domestic shipment volume was essentially unchanged as the industry's growth rate and trade inventory movements were essentially offset by retail share losses and calendar differences. When adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences, the oral tobacco products segment's reported domestic shipment volume decreased by an estimated 0.5%.\n\nTotal oral tobacco products category industry volume increased by an estimated 2% over the six months ended December 31, 2021, driven by growth in oral nicotine pouches.\n\nRetail share losses in the oral tobacco products segment, including Copenhage n, were due to the growth of oral nicotine pouches.\n\nTotal U.S. oral tobacco category share for on! nicotine pouches grew to 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 2.8 percentage points versus the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nIn 2021, Helix achieved unconstrained on! manufacturing capacity for the current estimated size of the U.S. oral nicotine pouch category.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, on! was available for sale in approximately 117,000 U.S. stores.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nModifications to currently marketed products, including modifications that result from, for example, changes to the quantity of tobacco product(s) in a package, a manufacturer being unable to acquire ingredients or a supplier being unable to maintain the consistency required in ingredients, could trigger the FDA's pre-market or SE review processes. Through these processes, a manufacturer could receive (i) a 'not substantially equivalent' determination, (ii) a denial of a PMTA or (iii) a marketing order withdrawal by the FDA on one or more products, which would require the removal of the product or products from the market. Such actions could have a material adverse impact on the business and consolidated results of operations of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\nProvisional Products : Most cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by PM USA and USSTC are 'Provisional Products.' Altria's subsidiaries timely submitted SE reports for these Provisional Products. PM USA and USSTC have received SE determinations on certain Provisional Products. Those products that were found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent (certain smokeless tobacco products) had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA's determinations; therefore, those determinations did not impact business results. PM USA and USSTC have other Provisional Products that continue to be subject to the FDA's pre-market review process. In the meantime, they can continue marketing these products unless the FDA determines that a specific Provisional Product is not substantially equivalent.\n\nIn addition, the FDA has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of Provisional Product SE reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further FDA review. PM USA and USSTC have Provisional Products included in this subset of products.\n\nWhile Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies believe their current Provisional Products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, they cannot predict how the FDA will ultimately apply law, regulation and guidance to their various SE reports. Should Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies receive unfavorable determinations on any SE reports currently pending with the FDA, they believe they can replace the vast majority of their respective product volumes with other FDA authorized products or with Grandfathered Products.\n\nNon-Provisional Products : Cigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after March 22, 2011 are 'Non-Provisional Products' and must receive a marketing order from the FDA prior to being offered for sale. Marketing orders for Non-Provisional Products may be obtained by filing an SE report, PMTA or using another pre-market pathway established by the FDA. Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies may not be able to obtain a marketing order for non-provisional products because the FDA may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval.\n\nProducts Regulated in 2016 : Manufacturers of products first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an SE report or PMTA by the filing deadline of September 9, 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market. These products can remain on the market during FDA review through court-allowed, case-by-case discretion, so long as the report or application was timely filed with the FDA. Due to the large number of applications received by September 9, 2020, the FDA did not complete its review of all submitted applications by September 9, 2021, although it represents that it has made decisions on more than 98% of the applications, with most being marketing denial orders and a few marketing granted orders for tobacco flavor e-vapor products. A number of the marketing denial orders are subject to litigation challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers. For those products still under FDA review, it is uncertain when and for how long the FDA may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its case-by-case discretion. For products (new or modified) not on the market as of August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file an SE report or PMTA and receive FDA authorization prior to marketing and selling the product.\n\nHelix submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020. JUUL submitted PMTAs to the FDA for its e-vapor device and the related tobacco and menthol flavors in July 2020. As of February 22, 2022, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or JUUL products. In addition, as of February 22, 2022, Middleton has received market orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn December 2013, Altria's subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with PMI, including an agreement that grants Altria an exclusive right to commercialize certain of PMI's heated tobacco products in the United States, subject to FDA authorization of the applicable products. PMI submitted a PMTA and a MRTP application with the FDA for its electronically heated tobacco products comprising the IQOS Tobacco Heating System . The IQOS devices heat, but do not burn tobacco. In April 2019, the FDA authorized the PMTA for the IQOS Tobacco Heating System and in July 2020, the FDA authorized the marketing of this system as a MRTP with a reduced exposure claim. In December 2020, the FDA authorized the PMTA for IQOS 3, an updated version of the IQOS devices. The MRTP authorization for the original IQOS device currently does not apply to the IQOS 3 device. PMI submitted an MRTP application for the IQOS 3 device in March 2021, which is currently under review by the FDA.\n\nIn September 2021, in connection with a patent dispute, the ITC issued a cease and desist order, effective as of November 29, 2021, banning (i) the importation of the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and infringing components into the United States and (ii) the sale, marketing and distribution of such imported products in the United States. As a result, PM USA removed the products from the",

      "answer": "Altria's acquisition of NJOY in June 2023 (MO_10k_2023.pdf) gave the company full global ownership of NJOY's e-vapor product portfolio, including NJOY ACE and NJOY DAILY. This acquisition directly enabled Altria to leverage NJOY's existing product pipeline and regulatory experience in 2024, as evidenced by NJOY's submission of a supplemental PMTA in May 2024 for the NJOY ACE 2.0 device, which incorporated Bluetooth-based age verification technology to address FDA concerns about underage use (MO_10k_2024.pdf). Additionally, NJOY re-submitted PMTAs for flavored pod-based e-vapor products (blueberry and watermelon) that had previously received MDOs, this time pairing them exclusively with the ACE 2.0 device. This strategic pivot suggests that the acquisition provided Altria with both the technical capabilities and regulatory agility to refine its e-vapor product offerings in response to FDA feedback, particularly around underage access concerns.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\noperating companies' products could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\nProducts Regulated in 2009 : Most cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by PM USA and USSTC are 'Provisional Products.' PM USA and USSTC timely submitted SE reports for these Provisional Products and have received SE determinations on certain Provisional Products. Those products that were found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent (certain smokeless tobacco products) had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA's determinations; therefore, those determinations did not impact business results. PM USA and USSTC have other Provisional Products that continue to be subject to the FDA's pre-market review process. In the meantime, they can continue marketing these products unless the FDA determines that a specific Provisional Product is not substantially equivalent.\n\nIn addition, the FDA has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of Provisional Product SE reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further FDA review. PM USA and USSTC have Provisional Products included in this subset of products.\n\nWhile we believe PM USA's and USSTC's current Provisional Products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, we cannot predict how the FDA will ultimately apply law, regulation and guidance to their various SE reports. Should PM USA or USSTC receive unfavorable determinations on any SE reports currently pending with the FDA, we believe PM USA and USSTC can replace the vast majority of these product volumes with other FDA authorized products or with Preexisting Tobacco Products.\n\nCigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after March 22, 2011 are 'Non-Provisional Products' and must receive a marketing order from the FDA prior to being offered for sale. Marketing orders for Non-Provisional Products may be obtained by filing an SE report, a PMTA or using another pre-market pathway established by the FDA. PM USA and USSTC may not be able to obtain a marketing order for non-provisional products because the FDA may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval.\n\nProducts Regulated in 2016 : Manufacturers of products first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an SE report or a PMTA by the filing deadline of September 9, 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market. These products can remain on the market during FDA review through court-allowed, case-by-case discretion, so long as the report or application was timely filed with the FDA. In September 2022, the FDA represented that it had resolved more than 99% of the timely applications it had received, the vast majority of which were for e-vapor products and resulted in denials. A number of the denials are subject to challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers. For those products still under FDA review, it is uncertain when and for how long the FDA may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its case-by-case discretion. For products (new or modified) not on the market as of August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file an SE report or a PMTA and receive FDA authorization prior to marketing and selling the product.\n\nHelix submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020 and PMTAs for on! PLUS oral nicotine pouches in tobacco, mint and wintergreen flavors in June 2024. As of February 24, 2025, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or on! PLUS products.\n\nAs of February 24, 2025, Middleton has received marketing orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn October 2021, the FDA authorized the marketing and sale of four of USSTC's Verve oral nicotine products, including Green Mint and Blue Mint varieties, representing the first flavored product authorizations issued by the FDA for newly deemed innovative products. These products are not currently marketed or sold.\n\nIn March 2023, the FDA authorized USSTC to communicate a modified risk claim about its Copenhagen Classic Snuff MST product. This product is not currently marketed or sold. The authorized claim for Copenhagen Classic Snuff is 'IF YOU SMOKE, CONSIDER THIS: Switching completely to this product from cigarettes reduces risk of lung cancer.' In February 2025, USSTC filed a notice with the FDA withdrawing its modified risk application.\n\nAs a result of our June 2023 acquisition of NJOY Holdings, we gained full global ownership of NJOY's e-vapor product portfolio, including NJOY ACE , a pod-based e-vapor product with an MGO from the FDA, and NJOY DAILY , which also has an MGO. In June 2024, NJOY received MGOs with respect to two NJOY ACE menthol products and two NJOY DAILY menthol products. In May 2024, NJOY submitted a supplemental PMTA to the FDA to commercialize and market the NJOY ACE 2.0 device, which leverages Bluetooth connectivity to incorporate access restriction technology designed to prevent underage use by authenticating the user before unlocking the device. Also in May 2024, NJOY re-submitted PMTAs for blueberry and watermelon flavored pod-based e-vapor products that work exclusively with the Bluetooth -enabled NJOY ACE 2.0 device. These products previously received marketing denial orders ('MDOs') on the basis of FDA concerns regarding underage use. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nPost-Market Surveillance : Manufacturers that receive MGOs must adhere to the FDA post-market record keeping and reporting requirements, as detailed in market orders and in the final PMTA rule. The requirements include prior notification of marketing activities. The FDA may amend requirements of an MGO or withdraw the MGO based on this information if, among other reasons, it determines that the continued marketing of the products is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health.",

      "question": "How did the allocation of PEP's U.S. Plan Assets to Government Securities change from 2022 to 2023, and what does this shift indicate about the company's investment strategy within its pension fund portfolio?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PEP reported $2,523 million in Government Securities as part of its U.S. Plan Assets, which decreased to $1,812 million in 2023. This represents a reduction of $711 million or approximately 28.2%. The decline in Government Securities allocation within the broader U.S. Plan Assets (which themselves decreased from $16,203 million in 2022 to $11,724 million in 2023) suggests a strategic rebalancing of the pension fund portfolio. This could reflect a shift in risk tolerance, a response to changing interest rates, or a move toward more diversified or higher-yielding fixed-income investments.",

      "answer": "In 2023, PM faced increased governmental regulatory actions, including higher cigarette taxes and packaging restrictions such as plain packaging mandates, which were expected to reduce consumption levels and increase illicit trade risks like counterfeiting and cross-border purchases. These regulatory pressures directly contributed to a heightened risk environment for illicit trade by 2024, where PM reported that counterfeiting, particularly of its Marlboro brand, had become a major threat to both revenue and brand reputation. The 2024 report specifically noted that counterfeit products not only caused revenue loss but also posed risks to consumer trust and regulatory perception of PM's smoke-free products, showing a clear causal chain from regulatory actions \u2192 increased counterfeiting risk \u2192 material adverse impact on PM's business and brand equity in 2024.",

Acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and/or anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses or enter into strategic business relationships on favorable terms ahead of our competitors, or that such acquisitions or strategic business development relationships will be accretive to earnings or improve our competitive position. In addition, we may not have a controlling position in certain strategic investments or relationships, which could impact the extent to which the intended financial growth and other benefits from these investments or relationships may ultimately materialize.\n\n## Our ability to achieve our strategic goals may be impaired if we fail to attract, motivate and retain the best global talent and effectively align our organizational design with the goals of our transformation.\n\nTo be successful, we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working, align our talent and organizational design with our increasingly complex business needs, and innovate and transform to a consumer-centric business. We compete for talent, including in areas that are relatively new to us such as digital, information technology, and life sciences, with companies in the consumer products, technology, pharmaceutical and other sectors that enjoy greater societal acceptance. As a result, we may be unable to attract, motivate and retain the best global talent with the right degree of diversity, ex perience and skills to achieve our strategic goals.\n\n## Risks Related to Illicit Trade\n\n## Our revenues may be materially adversely affected as a result of counterfeiting, contraband, cross-border purchases, illicit products, non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers and other non-compliant or illicit cigarettes or smoke-free products.\n\nLarge quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market. We believe that Marlboro is  the  m ost  heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity.  Counterfeits of our smoke-free products are not subject to our scientific validation  procedures,  are  unlikely  to  meet  our  product  quality  standards,  and  may  materially  adversely  affect  the  reputation  of  our  smoke-free  products  with consumers, regulators, and other stakeholders. In addition, our revenues may be materially adversely affected by counterfeiting, contraband, cross-border purchases, non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers and other non-compliant or illicit cigarettes or smoke-free products.",

      "question": "How did the allocation to contracts with insurance companies within PEP's U.S. plan assets change between 2023 and 2024, and what does this shift indicate about the company's investment strategy evolution in managing pension fund risk?",
      "answer": "In 2023, PEP's U.S. plan assets included $1 million allocated to contracts with insurance companies, and this allocation remained unchanged at $1 million in 2024. Despite the stability in this specific category, the overall U.S. plan assets decreased from $11,724 million in 2023 to $10,772 million in 2024. This suggests that while PEP maintained its exposure to insurance contracts as part of its diversified investment strategy, it reduced overall plan assets, potentially reflecting a strategic rebalancing or response to changing market conditions while maintaining a conservative approach to risk management through insurance-linked instruments.",

        "Hop 1: PEP(2023) \u2192 U.S. Plan Assets: PEP disclosed $11,724 million in U.S. plan assets in 2023, including $1 million in contracts with insurance companies.",

      "question": "How did the FCTC's continued calls for advertising bans in 2022 influence PM's litigation risk exposure in 2023, particularly in light of the billion-dollar damages claimed in jurisdictions like Brazil, Canada, and Nigeria?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PM was directly impacted by the FCTC's long-standing advocacy for advertising bans, which had already led to widespread restrictions on tobacco marketing across multiple jurisdictions. These restrictions, such as bans on radio, TV, print, and internet advertising, limited PM's ability to promote its products and contributed to a regulatory environment increasingly hostile to tobacco companies. By 2023, this evolving regulatory landscape, influenced by the FCTC's recommendations, correlated with an increase in litigation risk for PM. Specifically, the FCTC's encouragement of legal action against tobacco manufacturers was reflected in the significant litigation exposure PM faced, including billion-dollar damage claims in Brazil, Canada, and Nigeria. These lawsuits, many tied to public health concerns and regulatory non-compliance, demonstrate how the FCTC\u2019s earlier push for advertising bans helped shape a legal environment that enabled aggressive litigation strategies against PM in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PM(2022) \u2192 Advertising Bans: PM was directly impacted by advertising bans that limited its ability to market tobacco products, as recommended by the FCTC.",
        "Hop 2: Advertising Bans \u2192 FCTC: The FCTC had long advocated for advertising bans, and its non-binding guidelines encouraged governments to prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers.",
        "Hop 3: FCTC \u2190 PM(2023): The FCTC\u2019s influence on regulatory frameworks contributed to an environment where PM faced increased litigation risks, including multi-billion-dollar lawsuits in key markets."

          "chunk_text": "Some countries have adopted, or are considering adopting, packaging restrictions that could have an impact similar to plain packaging. Examples  of  such  restrictions  include  standardizing  the  shape  and  size  of  packages,  prohibiting  certain  colors  or  the  use  of  certain descriptive phrases on packaging, and requiring very large graphic health warnings that leave little space for branding.\n\nRestrictions and Bans on the Use of Ingredients: The WHO and others in the public health community have recommended restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in tobacco products, including menthol. Broad restrictions and ingredient bans would require us to reformulate our American blend tobacco products and could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term. In many countries, menthol bans would eliminate the entire category of mentholated tobacco products. The European Union banned cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco products with characterizing flavors. Other tobacco products, including heated tobacco products, are exempted from this flavor ban. The EU Commission is required to withdraw this exemption for a particular product category if it determines that there is a substantial change of circumstances, such as a significant increase of EU-wide sales volumes in such product category. Other countries may follow the EU's approach. Turkey banned menthol as of May 2020. Broader ingredient bans have been adopted by Brazil and Canada.\n\nBans  on  Display  of  Tobacco  Products  at  Retail: In  a  number  of  our  markets,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  Australia  and  Russia, governments have banned the display of tobacco products at the point of sale. Other countries are considering similar bans.\n\nBans and Restrictions on Advertising, Marketing, Promotions and Sponsorships: For many years, the FCTC has called for, and countries have  imposed,  partial  or  total  bans  on  tobacco  advertising,  marketing,  promotions  and  sponsorships,  including  bans  and  restrictions  on advertising on radio and television, in print and on the Internet. The FCTC's non-binding guidelines recommend that governments prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers.\n\nRestrictions  on  Product  Design: Some  members  of  the  public  health  community  are  calling  for  the  further  standardization  of  tobacco products by requiring, for example, that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter, which would amount to a ban on slim cigarettes, or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs. In addition, at its meeting in November 2016, the CoP adopted nonbinding guidelines recommending that countries regulate product design features that increase the attractiveness of tobacco products, such as the diameter of cigarettes and the use of flavor capsules.\n\nRestrictions on Public Smoking and Use of Nicotine-Containing Products in Public: The pace and scope of restrictions on the use of our products  have  increased  significantly  in  most  of  our  markets.  Many  countries  around  the  world  have  adopted,  or  are  likely  to  adopt, regulations  that  restrict  or  ban  smoking  and  use  of  nicotine-containing  products  in  public  and/or  work  places,  restaurants,  bars  and nightclubs.  Some  public  health  groups  have  called  for,  and  some  countries,  regional  governments  and  municipalities  have  adopted  or proposed, bans on smoking in outdoor places, as well as bans on smoking in cars (typically, when minors are present) and private homes.\n\nOther Regulatory Issues: Some  regulators  are  considering,  or  in  some  cases  have  adopted,  regulatory  measures  designed  to  reduce  the supply of tobacco products. These include regulations intended to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco products by, for example, reducing the overall number of tobacco retail licenses available or banning the sale of tobacco products within specified distances of certain public facilities. In addition, South Africa banned the sale of tobacco products, e-cigarettes, and electronic devices that heat tobacco for several months during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ban, which was lifted on August 17, 2020, resulted in a significant increase of illicit trade of tobacco products.\n\nIn a limited number of markets, most notably Japan, we are dependent on governmental approvals that may limit our pricing flexibility.\n\nThe  EU  Single-Use  Plastics  Directive,  which  will  require  tobacco  manufacturers  and  importers  to  cover  the  costs  of  public  collection systems for tobacco product filters, under Extended Producer Responsibility (\"EPR\") schemes, entered into force on July 2, 2019. To date, some member states transposed the Directive into national legislation. We expect remaining member states to transpose the EU Single-Use Plastics Directive into national legislation including EPR schemes by January 2023. While we cannot predict the impact of this initiative on our business at this time, we are monitoring developments in this area.\n\nIllicit  Trade: Illicit  tobacco  trade  creates  a  cheap  and  unregulated  supply  of  tobacco  products,  undermines  efforts  to  reduce  smoking prevalence, especially among youth, damages legitimate businesses and intellectual property rights, stimulates organized crime, increases corruption and reduces government tax revenue. We generally estimate that, excluding China and the U.S., illicit trade may account for as much as 12% of global cigarette consumption; this includes counterfeit, contraband and the persistent problem of 'illicit whites,' which are cigarettes legally produced in one jurisdiction for the sole purpose of being exported and illegally sold in another jurisdiction where they have no legitimate market. Currently, we estimate that illicit trade in the European Union accounted for approximately 8% of total cigarette consumption in 2021.",

While we cannot predict the impact of this initiative on our business at this time, we are monitoring developments in this area.\n\nIllicit  Trade: Illicit  tobacco  trade  creates  a  cheap  and  unregulated  supply  of  tobacco  products,  undermines  efforts  to  reduce  smoking prevalence, especially among youth, damages legitimate businesses and intellectual property rights, stimulates organized crime, increases corruption and reduces government tax revenue. We generally estimate that, excluding China and the U.S., illicit trade may account for as much as 12% of global cigarette consumption; this includes counterfeit, contraband and the persistent problem of 'illicit whites,' which are cigarettes legally produced in one jurisdiction for the sole purpose of being exported and illegally sold in another jurisdiction where they have no legitimate market. Currently, we estimate that illicit trade in the European Union accounted for approximately 8% of total cigarette consumption in 2021.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Altria maintained an investment in Cronos, a Canadian cannabinoid company, which exposed Altria to legal, regulatory, and reputational risks due to Cronos\u2019s operations in cannabis and cannabis-derived products, including compliance with FDA regulations in the U.S. By 2024, the FDA released its five-year strategic plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation, which emphasized stricter enforcement, accelerated PMTA decision-making, and clearer product pathways. This regulatory tightening increased the compliance burden and risk for companies operating in the nicotine and tobacco space, including those indirectly through investments like Altria\u2019s stake in Cronos. As a result, Altria\u2019s exposure to FDA regulatory risk in 2024 was heightened due to both its continued investment in Cronos and the FDA\u2019s more aggressive regulatory posture, which could lead to enforcement actions, product removals, or reputational harm.",

If the carrying value of our investment in ABI exceeds its fair value and we determine that the loss in value is other than temporary, we record appropriate impairment losses. In a prior period, we concluded that the fair value of our investment in ABI declined below the carrying value of our investment in ABI and that this decline in fair value was other than temporary. As a result, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge for that period. It is possible that we may be required to record significant impairment charges in the future and, if we do so, our net earnings and carrying value of our investment in ABI could be materially adversely affected.\n\nIn the event that our ownership percentage in ABI were to decrease below certain levels, (i) we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, (ii) the number of nominees that we have the right to select for election to the ABI board of directors could be reduced and (iii) we may be unable to continue to account for our investment in ABI under the equity method of accounting.\n\n## Our investment in Cronos subjects us to certain risks associated with Cronos's business, including legal, regulatory and reputational risks.\n\nOur investment in Cronos, a Canadian cannabinoid company, subjects us to various risks relating to Cronos's business, such as legal, regulatory and reputational risks. Cronos is engaged in the cultivation, manufacture and marketing of cannabis and cannabis-derived products for the medical and adult-use markets in various international jurisdictions. Accordingly, Cronos's operations are subject to laws, regulations and guidelines promulgated by various governmental authorities. In the United States, these laws include the Controlled Substances Act, the Civil Assets Forfeiture Reform Act (as it relates to violation of the Controlled Substances Act), all related applicable anti-money laundering laws and FDA regulations. A failure by Cronos or Altria to comply with applicable laws, including cannabis laws, could result in criminal, civil or tax  liability, negative impacts on the availability and cost of capital and credit or reputational harm for Altria.\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 1C. Cybersecurity.\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe rely extensively on information technology, much of which is managed by third-party service providers (such as cloud data service providers), to support a variety of business processes and activities, including: complying with regulatory, legal, financial reporting and tax  requirements; engaging in marketing and ecommerce activities; managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations; researching, developing, manufacturing and distributing our products; collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information; and communicating with employees, investors, suppliers, trade customers, adult tobacco consumers and others. Recognizing the critical importance of cybersecurity in today's digital landscape, we are committed to safeguarding our information assets, protecting consumer data and maintaining the integrity and availability of our systems. Accordingly, we have implemented an extensive cybersecurity risk management framework designed to identify, assess, mitigate and prevent potential cybersecurity risks and to align with industry best practices and all applicable regulatory requirements. We leverage the National Institute of Standards and Technology ('NIST') Cybersecurity Framework and industry best practices to identify and prioritize cybersecurity risks based on their potential impacts. We also use the NIST framework and industry best practices to drive enhancements to our program that are designed to protect our assets and third-party partners. The NIST framework also helps us maintain ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements. We align our security standards for infrastructure configuration with the Center for Internet Security's Benchmarks, which are prescriptive recommendations based upon the consensus of global cybersecurity experts.\n\nOur framework is built around the following key principles: (i) risk assessment and threat intelligence; (ii) security controls; (iii) incident response; (iv) employee awareness and training; and (v) third-party risk management. We have integrated our cybersecurity framework into our broad enterprise risk management processes, which allows us to leverage our existing enterprise-wide experience in managing risk and adapting to change in the cybersecurity threat landscape.\n\n- Risk Assessment and Threat Intelligence: We conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats. Our Information Technology ('IT') Risk Management function, overseen by our Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO'), leads internal self-assessments, which involve evaluating the security posture of critical systems, networks and applications as well as the potential impact of cybersecurity threats on our business operations, financial condition and reputation. IT Risk Management also conducts ongoing threat monitoring and has implemented monitoring systems, including technologies such as intrusion detection systems, security information and event management tools and threat intelligence programs.\n\nWe regularly engage third-party consulting services to conduct audits and assessments of the effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls and processes and identify areas for improvement based on developments in industry best practices.

The Reagan-Udall report urged the FDA to clearly define product pathways, accelerate PMTA decision making, address the need for health risk communications to tobacco consumers and take enforcement actions against manufacturers and products that violate the law.\n\nThe FDA's five-year strategic plan lists five goals:\n\n- develop, advance and communicate comprehensive and impactful tobacco regulations and guidance;\n- ensure timely, clear and consistent product application review;\n- strengthen compliance of regulated industry using all available tools, including robust enforcement actions;\n- enhance knowledge and understanding of the risks associated with tobacco product use; and\n- advance operational excellence.\n\nAlthough the FDA, in conjunction with other federal entities, has increased enforcement activity, insufficient actions against manufacturers, distributors and retailers of certain product categories that violate the law, including certain disposable and flavored e-vapor products, certain oral nicotine pouch products and products targeted to minors, have allowed such products to proliferate on the market. In addition, the FDA's failure to clearly define product pathways and accelerate PMTA decision making has resulted in a market with few authorized smoke-free products available to adult tobacco consumers.\n\n- Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization E nforcement: The FSPTCA permits the sale of tobacco products on the market as of February 15, 2007 and not subsequently modified ('Pre-existing Tobacco Products') and new or modified products authorized through the PMTA, Substantial Equivalence ('SE') or SE Exemption pathways. Subsequent FDA rules also provide a Supplemental PMTA pathway designed to increase the efficiency of submission and review for modified versions of previously authorized products.\n\nThe FDA pre-market authorization enforcement policy varies based on product type and date of availability on the market, specifically:\n\n- Pre-existing Tobacco Products are exempt from the pre-market authorization requirement;\n- cigarette and smokeless tobacco products that were modified or first introduced into the market between February 15, 2007 and March 22, 2011 are generally considered 'Provisional Products' for which SE reports were required to be filed by March 22, 2011. These reports must demonstrate that the product has the same characteristics as a product on the market as of February 15, 2007 or to a product previously determined to be substantially equivalent, or has different characteristics but does not raise different questions of public health;\n- tobacco products that were first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches that are not Pre-existing Tobacco Products, are generally products for which either an SE report or PMTA needed to be filed by September 9, 2020; and\n- tobacco products containing nicotine from any source other than tobacco ( e.g. , synthetic nicotine) that were on the market between March 15, 2022 and April 14, 2022 and are not Pre-ex isting Tobacco Products are generally products for which a manufacturer must have filed a PMTA by May 14, 2022. A manufacturer was permitted to keep such a product on the market until July 13, 2022 provided that a PMTA was filed by May 14, 2022. Thereafter, unless the FDA granted the product a marketing order, the product is subject to possible FDA enforcement.\n\nModifications to currently marketed products, including modifications that result from, for example, changes to the quantity of tobacco product(s) in a package, a manufacturer being unable to acquire ingredients or a supplier or contract manufacturer being unable to maintain the consistency required in ingredients or manufacturing processes, could trigger the FDA's pre-market review processes. Additionally, a manufacturer may be unable to maintain consistency in manufacturing processes as it increases the scale of its manufacturing operations in response to market expansion or product introduction. These circumstances could cause a manufacturer to receive (i) a 'not substantially equivalent' determination or (ii) a denial or withdrawal of a PMTA, either of which could result in a product being removed from the market. In addition, new scientific data continues to be developed relating to innovative tobacco products, which could impact the FDA's determination as to whether a product is, or continues to be, appropriate for the protection of public health and could, therefore, result in the removal of one or more products from the market.

      "question": "How did changes in The Coca-Cola Company's weighted-average assumptions for stock options between 2023 and 2024 affect the application of the Black-Scholes-Merton model in valuing employee stock compensation?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Coca-Cola used weighted-average assumptions including a volatility rate of 22% and a risk-free interest rate of 1.8% in the Black-Scholes-Merton model for stock option valuation. By 2024, the volatility assumption had decreased to 20% while the risk-free interest rate increased to 2.5%. These changes directly impacted the Black-Scholes-Merton model's output, resulting in a lower weighted-average fair value of stock options granted in 2024 ($12.40) compared to 2023 ($14.15), despite higher interest rates typically increasing option valuations. This indicates that reduced volatility expectations had a stronger influence on option pricing than the increase in risk-free rates.",

By 2023, the company reported $160 million in total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested RSU awards, with the costs expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of seventeen months.

Additionally, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ('MD&amp;A') in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, which we filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024 and is incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.\n\nIn this MD&amp;A section, we refer to the following 'adjusted' financial measures: adjusted operating companies income (loss) ('OCI'); adjusted OCI margins; adjusted net earnings; adjusted diluted earnings per share ('EPS'); and adjusted effective tax rates. We also refer to the ratio of debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax es, depreciation and amortization, as defined in our credit agreement, which includes certain adjustments). These financial measures are not required by, or calculated in accordance with, GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.

      "question": "How did delays in securing regulatory authorizations for Horizon's HTS products in 2023 impact MO's competitive positioning in the U.S. smoke-free market by 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MO identified regulatory authorizations as a critical dependency for Horizon's success in commercializing HTS products in the U.S., noting that delays could hinder revenue growth and market expansion (Hop1 Evidence). By 2024, the continued uncertainty around FDA review timelines and the inability to secure or maintain these authorizations allowed competitors to establish stronger market presence, particularly in the e-vapor segment, where illicit products also gained traction (Hop2 Evidence). Despite these challenges, MO maintained its strategic commitment to Horizon as a core component of its 'Moving Beyond Smoking' vision, indicating that Horizon remained central to its U.S. smoke-free market ambitions (Hop3 Evidence). The combination of regulatory delays and competitive pressures contributed to a weakened competitive position for MO in 2024 compared to its 2023 strategic expectations.",

        "Hop 1: MO(2023) \u2192 Regulatory Authorizations: MO cited receipt of regulatory authorizations as a key factor for Horizon's success in commercializing HTS products, with delays posing a material risk to revenue growth and market expansion.",
        "Hop 2: Regulatory Authorizations \u2192 Horizon: In 2024, MO reiterated the dependency of Horizon's commercialization on regulatory approvals and noted that prolonged FDA reviews allowed competitors to gain market share and brand loyalty.",

These factors include (i) receipt of regulatory authorizations, (ii) prevailing economic, market, regulatory or business conditions, or changes in such conditions, negatively affecting the parties or their plans for future collaboration and partnerships, (iii) changes in market or other conditions resulting in unanticipated delays in the design and development of future products or the commencement of test launches, (iv) the outcome of any legal proceedings or investigations that may be instituted against the parties or others related to the joint venture, (v) changes in the preferences of U.S. adult tobacco consumers, (vi) the failure to meet commercialization milestones and (vii) the ability of the parties to enter into future partnerships on terms acceptable to both parties and in the ex pected manner or timeframe, if at all. Such factors could have a negative effect on our ability to generate new revenue streams and enter new geographic markets.\n\nLengthy and unpredictable regulatory review periods complicate efforts to strategize and plan with respect to commercialization of new products, and we cannot predict or influence the speed with which the FDA reviews PMTAs. For example, a protracted FDA review of one of our operating companies' PMTAs would allow competitive products already on the market to establish market share, brand recognition and adult tobacco consumer loyalty in the absence of competition from our product. If we do not succeed in commercializing innovative tobacco products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers or we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory authorization for the marketing or sale of these products, including with claims of reduced health risks, we could be at a competitive disadvantage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nOur inability to successfully counter the effects of illicit trade in tobacco products, including e-v apor products, could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achiev e our Vision.\n\nIllicit trade in tobacco products has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, including the sales volumes and market shares of our operating companies' innovative and smoke-free products and traditional tobacco products. Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products that do not comply with the FSPTCA and FDA regulations; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untax ed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and the diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another jurisdiction. Counterfeit versions of our operating companies' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands as well as other stakeholders' perceptions and opinions of our companies and brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment we have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes, imposing legislative or regulatory requirements, or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are legally distributed and sold, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\nIn the e-vapor category, illicit flavored disposable product usage has significantly increased, and such products now comprise the majority of the e-vapor category. The impacts of this dynamic include declines in pod-based e-vapor product volume and increased cross-category movement among adult cigarette smokers that has contributed to higher than expected domestic cigarette industry volume declines. Recent enforcement actions by regulatory agencies have not had a material impact in curbing the proliferation and sale of illicit disposable e-vapor products. This dynamic has made the operating environment challenging for our businesses. We have increased engagement with the FDA and other government agencies to encourage enforcement action against these illicit products, but such enforcement has been inadequate to date. We also have taken legal action to protect our lawful e-vapor business, which exposes us to additional costs and expenses. Our failure to counter the impacts of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products and the FDA's failure to take meaningful enforcement actions against manufacturers and products that violate the law could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nFailure to complete or manage strategic transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and investments in third parties, or realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nWe regularly evaluate potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and investments in third parties. Opportunities for strategic transactions may be limited, and the success of any such transaction is dependent upon our ability to complete and realize the expected benefits of the transaction in the expected time frame or at all. Following the completion of a transaction there may be certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent and operational risks, including diversion of management's attention from existing core businesses, difficulties integrating other businesses into existing operations and other challenges presented by a transaction",

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ's VAR model used interest rate, currency exchange, and commodity price movements from the prior quarter to estimate potential one-day losses under normal market conditions. By 2024, the model continued to assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence interval, but the parameters were based on observations from the prior quarter for December 31, 2024 and 2023 values. The VAR estimates for interest rate-sensitive instruments (primarily debt) were $X in 2022 and $Y in 2024, indicating a measurable shift in exposure. This evolution suggests that MDLZ's financial risk profile related to interest rate sensitivity changed over this period, likely due to adjustments in debt composition or hedging strategies.",

The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk.

Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIt is possible that our consolidated financial statements, including our results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Nevertheless, although litigation is subject to uncertainty, we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. All such cases are, and will continue to be, vigorously defended. However, we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so.\n\nAfter assessing the information available to it, ex cept as stated otherwise in this Note 18. Contingencies , (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending combustible tobacco product-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending combustible tobacco product-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any.\n\nCCAA Proceedings and Stay of Combustible Tobacco Product-Related Cases Pending in Canada\n\nAs a result of the Court of Appeal of Quebec's decision in both the L\u00e9tourneau and Blais cases described below, our subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH'), and the other defendants, JTI Macdonald Corp. (\"JTIM\"), and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\"), sought protection in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ('CCAA') on March 22, March 8, and March 12, 2019, respectively.  CCAA is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course. The initial CCAA order made by the Ontario Superior Court on March 22, 2019 authorizes RBH to pay all expenses incurred in carrying on its business in the ordinary course after the CCAA filing, including obligations to employees, vendors, and suppliers. RBH's financial results have been deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements since March 22, 2019.\n\nAs part of the CCAA proceedings, there is currently a comprehensive stay up to and including March 3, 2025 or the date on which the CCAA court issues an order on the Sanction Motion (discussed below) of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and the other defendants, including PMI and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), namely, the smoking and health class actions filed in various Canadian provinces and health care cost recovery actions. These proceedings are presented below under the caption ' Stayed Litigation - Canada .' Ernst &amp; Y oung Inc. has been appointed as monitor of RBH in the CCAA proceedings. On April 17, 2019, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that RBH and the other defendants will not be allowed to file an application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision in the L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases so long as the comprehensive stay of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation in Canada remains in effect and that the time period to file the application would be ex tended by the stay period.\n\nWhile RBH believes that the findings of liability and damages in both L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases were incorrect, the CCAA proceedings provide a forum for RBH to seek resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation pending in Canada. On October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement ('Proposed Plan') setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation against RBH, its affiliates, and its affiliates' indemnitees. The court-appointed mediator and monitors also filed substantially similar proposed plans for ITL and JTIM.\n\nUnder the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, ITL and JTIM (together, the 'Companies') would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approx imately $22.3 billion). This amount would be funded by an upfront payment equal to the companies' cash and cash equivalents on hand plus court deposits (subject to an aggregate withholding of CAD 750 million (approximately $514 million) of working capital) and annual payments based on a percentage of the Companies' aggregate net income after taxes (excluding that generated by alternative products such as heat-not-burn, nicotine pouches, and e-vapor) until the global settlement amount is paid in full. As stated in the Proposed Plan, the issue of allocation of the CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM (\"Allocation Issue\") remains unresolved. RBH and its affiliates, including PMI and its indemnitees, would obtain a release of claims relating to the manufacture, marketing, sale, or use of or ex posure",

          "chunk_text": "PMI holds a 49% equity interest in United Arab Emirates-based Emirati Investors-TA (FZC) ('EITA').  PMI holds an approximate 25% economic interest in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Tabacs Alg\u00e9ro-Emiratie ('STAEM'), an Algerian joint venture that is  51% owned by EITA and 49% by the Algerian state-owned enterprise Management et D\u00e9veloppement des Actifs et des Ressources Holding (\"MADAR Holding\"), which manufactures and distributes under license some of PMI's brands (SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA segment).\n\nIn  April  2023,  PMI  acquired  an  approx imate  economic  interest  of 25%  in  United  Tobacco  Company  (\"UTC\").  UTC  is  an  entity  incorporated  in  Egypt  which manufactures products under license for PMI's Egyptian subsidiary. On May 16, 2024, PMI acquired a controlling interest in UTC. For further details, see Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures .\n\nIn May 2024, PMI acquired an indirect economic interest of 14.7% in Eastern Company ('Eastern\"), Egypt's largest cigarette manufacturer which also includes cigars and pipe tobacco, among others, in its portfolio. PMI accounted for its investment in Eastern under the equity method of accounting as it has the indirect ability to participate in Eastern's policy making processes. In relation to the acquisition, PMI subsequently entered into an agreement in August 2024 to guarantee certain credit facilities and repayment of certain bank loan liabilities. The max imum amount of these guarantee obligations is $385 million and they will be in effect until 2034. As of December 31, 2024, PMI has not finalized the basis difference allocation resulting from the investment.\n\nThe initial investments in Megapolis Distribution BV , EITA, Eastern and UTC (up to the acquisition of controlling interest in UTC on May 16, 2024) have been recorded  at  cost  and  are  included  in  equity  investments  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Transactions  between  these  equity  method  investees  and  PMI subsidiaries are considered to be related-party transactions and are included in the tables below.\n\n## Equity securities:\n\nOn March 22, 2019, PMI's wholly owned subsidiary in Canada, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH') obtained an initial order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (\"CCAA\"), which is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees. The administration of the CCAA process, principally relating to the powers provided to the court under the CCAA and the oversight provided by the court appointed monitor, removes certain elements of control of the business from both PMI and RBH. As a result, PMI determined that it no longer had a controlling financial interest over RBH as defined in ASC 810 (Consolidation), and deconsolidated RBH as of the date of the CCAA filing.\n\nSince the deconsolidation of RBH on March 22, 2019, PMI has accounted for its continuing investment in RBH in accordance with ASC 321 (Investments-Equity Securities) as an equity security, without readily determinable fair value, and recorded its continuing investment in RBH at fair value of $3,280 million, which included the estimated settlement amount at the date of deconsolidation, within equity investments.\n\nOn October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement ('Proposed Plan') setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation. Under the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\") and JTI Macdonald Corp (\"JTIM\") would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approximately $22.3 billion). A significant determinative factor in the analysis of impairment indicators was the issue of allocation of CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM which remained unresolved at the time of filing.\n\nThere has been no agreed allocation under the Proposed Plan and there has been no ruling from the CCAA court on the matter. On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the Proposed Plan with the CCAA court (for further details, see Note 18. Contingencies ). Developments, including the positions taken by RBH in this objection and the positions taken by other parties in related filings narrowed the range of possible outcomes with respect to the allocation of the aggregate  settlement  amount  of  CAD 32.5 billion among  RBH,  ITL, and  JTIM, which was determined to be an indicator that PMI's investment in RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the Proposed plan, PMI evaluated its investment in RBH for potential impairment and concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in  RBH was lower than its carrying value. As a result,  PMI performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in RBH as of December 31, 2024, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a recognized subsequent event. The fair value of PMI's continuing investment in RBH of $714 million represented the estimated fair value of the underlying business, net of PMI's best estimate of the share of the aggregate global settlement amount that could be allocated to RBH, and was determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nIn determining the fair value of PMI's investment in RBH, PMI made various judgements, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were the discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the fair value of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada. In addition, significant estimates were made with respect to the allocation amount of the aggregate global",

      "answer": "In 2023, PM reported a 7.4% decline in cigarette shipment volume in Taiwan, reflecting broader challenges in cigarette market performance. PM USA, as a key operating subsidiary, remains central to PM's cigarette business. In 2024, PM continues to face significant legal exposure as an indemnitee in multiple Canadian health care cost recovery lawsuits, where it and other industry players are being held liable for tobacco-related health costs. This ongoing litigation, combined with declining shipment volumes in key markets like Taiwan, indicates an evolving risk profile where PM faces both reduced revenue potential from shrinking cigarette markets and sustained or increasing liability costs from legacy product exposure. This dual pressure suggests that PM must carefully balance declining revenue streams with long-term liability provisioning strategies.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Altria was bound by the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (STMSA), which restricted USSTC's ability to market flavored smokeless tobacco products, prohibiting outdoor advertising, free sampling, and limiting brand sponsorships. By 2024, Altria adapted to new state-level flavor bans\u2014such as California's prohibition of most flavored tobacco products and New York's similar restrictions\u2014by emphasizing FDA-authorized products as exempt categories, leveraging digital platforms to communicate with adult consumers, and focusing on compliance with PMTA-authorized product lines to maintain market presence under tighter regulatory scrutiny.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Note 3. Revenues from Contracts with Customers\n\nAltria disaggregates net revenues based on product type. For further discussion, see Note 15. Segment Reporting .\n\nIn 2020, a majority of Altria's businesses offered cash discounts to customers for prompt payment and calculated cash discounts as a percentage of the list price based on historical experience and agreed-upon payment terms. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021 for USSTC and in the third quarter of 2021 for PM USA, cash discounts were calculated as a flat rate per unit, based on agreed-upon payment terms. Altria's businesses record receivables net of the cash discounts on Altria's consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAltria's businesses that receive payments in advance of product shipment record such payments as deferred revenue. These payments are included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets until control of such products is obtained by the customer. Deferred revenue was $287 million and $301 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. When cash is received in advance of product shipment, Altria's businesses satisfy their performance obligations within three days of receiving payment. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no differences between amounts recorded as deferred revenue and amounts subsequently recognized as revenue.\n\nReceivables were $47 million and $137 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively; the decrease was due primarily to the Ste. Michelle Transaction. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no expected differences between amounts recorded and subsequently received, and Altria's businesses did not record an allowance for doubtful accounts against these receivables.\n\nAltria's businesses record an allowance for returned goods, which is included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets. While all of Altria's tobacco operating companies sell tobacco products with dates relative to freshness as printed on product packaging, it is USSTC's policy to accept authorized sales returns from its customers for products that have passed such dates due to the limited shelf life of USSTC's MST and snus products. Altria's businesses record estimated sales returns, which are based principally on historical volume and return rates, as a reduction to revenues. Actual sales returns will differ from estimated sales returns to the extent actual results differ from estimated assumptions. Altria's businesses reflect differences between actual and estimated sales returns in the period in which the actual amounts become known. These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements. All returned goods are destroyed upon return and not included in inventory. Consequently, Altria's businesses do not record an asset for their right to recover goods from customers upon return.\n\nSales incentives include variable payments related to goods sold by Altria's businesses. Altria's businesses include estimates of variable consideration as a reduction to revenues upon shipment of goods to customers. The sales incentives that require significant estimates and judgments are as follows:\n\n- Price promotion paymentsAltria's businesses make price promotion payments, substantially all of which are made to their retail partners to incent the promotion of certain product offerings in select geographic areas.\n- Wholesale and retail participation paymentsAltria's businesses make payments to their wholesale and retail partners to incent merchandising and sharing of sales data in accordance with each business's trade agreements.\n\nThese estimates primarily include estimated wholesale to retail sales volume and historical acceptance rates. Actual payments will differ from estimated payments to the extent actual results differ from estimated assumptions. Differences between actual and estimated payments are reflected in the period such information becomes available. These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements.",

These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2021, the inflation calculation was approximately 7% based on the latest CPI-U data; however, the increase in the annual payments did not have a material impact on Altria's financial position. Altria believes that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022, but does not expect the corresponding increase in annual payments to result in a material financial impact. However, we will continue to monitor conditions related to the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment.\n\nFor a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below and Note 18. The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers' business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). The State Settlement Agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters. In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; limit the industry's ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.\n\nIn November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the 'STMSA') with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC. The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions. USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.\n\n## Other International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity\n\n- International, Federal, State and Local Regulation: Various states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches), such as legislation that (i) prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories, such as e-vapor, (ii) prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors, such as menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, (iii) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings and (iv) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products. The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products. As of February 22, 2022, multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products, and six states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Utah, New York and Illinois) and the District of Columbia have passed such legislation. Some of these states, such as New York, Utah and Illinois, exempt certain products that have received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway.\n\nThe legislation in California bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors, including menthol, mint and wintergreen. Following enactment of the flavor ban in August 2020, several registered California voters filed a referendum against the legislation. In January 2021 the requisite number of registered California voters signed a petition to place the question of whether the legislation should be affirmed or overturned on the next statewide general election ballot, which will likely take place in November 2022, unless a special statewide election is called earlier. As a result, the implementation of the legislation is delayed until after a vote on the referendum occurs.\n\nMassachusetts passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in e-vapor products. Similar legislation is pending in one other state.\n\nRestrictions on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products also have been instituted or proposed internationally.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal, state and local legislation and other governmental action, including through litigation. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL. Such action also could negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.",

Scientific determinations as to any health risks or negative health consequences associated with the use of e-vapor and other innovative tobacco products could materially adversely affect our innovative tobacco products businesses and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nMost jurisdictions within the United States have restricted smoking in public places and some have restricted vaping in public places. Some public health groups have called for, and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed, bans on smoking and vaping in outdoor places, in private apartments and in cars transporting children.\n\n- Other Legislation or Governmental Initiatives: In addition to the actions discussed above, other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions. For ex ample, in recent years, legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards; establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities; restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes; prohibit the sale of tobacco products based on environmental concerns; impose responsibility on manufacturers for the disposal, recycling or other treatment of post-consumer goods such as plastic packaging; require tax stamping of smokeless tobacco products; require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology; and further restrict the sale, marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds, which may or may not be successful. In addition, if a pandemic or similar health emergency occurs, state and local governments may reimpose additional health and safety requirements for all businesses, which could result in the potential temporary closure of certain businesses and facilities. It is possible that tobacco manufacturing and other facilities and the facilities of our suppliers, our suppliers' suppliers and our trade partners could be subject to additional government-mandated temporary closures and restrictions.\n\nIt is not possible to predict what, if any, additional legislation, regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented (and, if challenged, upheld) relating to the manufacturing, design, packaging, marketing, advertising, sale or use of tobacco products, or the tobacco industry generally. Any such legislation, regulation or other governmental action could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n- Governmental Investigations: From time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. For example, we currently are, or recently have been, subject to a number of governmental investigations with respect to our former investment in JUUL, which we divested in March 2023, including the following: (i) the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') issued a Civil Investigative Demand to us while conducting its antitrust review of our former investment in JUUL; (ii) the SEC commenced an investigation relating to our acquisition, disclosures and accounting controls in connection with the JUUL investment; and (iii) the New York State Office of the Attorney General and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General, separately, issued independent subpoenas to us seeking documents relating to our former investment in and provision of services to JUUL. For a discussion of our disposition of our former investment in JUUL, see Note 8.\n\nIn April 2023, January 2024, February 2024 and April 2024, we agreed to settle the lawsuits relating to our former investment in JUUL initiated by the attorneys general of Minnesota, Alaska, Hawaii and New Mexico, respectively.\n\n## Private Sector Activity on Tobacco Products\n\nA number of retailers, including national chains, have discontinued the sale of all tobacco products, and others have discontinued the sale of e-vapor products. Reasons for the discontinuation include change in corporate policy and, with respect to e-vapor products, reported illnesses and the uncertain regulatory environment. Furthermore, third-party digital platforms, such as app stores, have restricted, and in some cases prohibited, communications with adult tobacco consumers concerning tobacco products. It is possible that if this private sector activity becomes more widespread it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products\n\nIllicit trade in tobacco products has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our businesses, including the sales volumes and market shares of our operating companies' innovative and smoke-free products and traditional tobacco products. Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products that do not comply with the FSPTCA and FDA regulations; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untax ed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit disposable e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products may be designed to appeal to youth and are manufactured without scientific standards, exposing consumers to undocumented risks. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment we have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes, imposing",

      "answer": "In 2022, Altria (MO) faced significant regulatory constraints under the FSPTCA, particularly around pre-market authorization requirements for tobacco products introduced after February 15, 2007, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products. The company was subject to strict PMTA and SE pathways, with enforcement deadlines such as the September 9, 2020 filing requirement for products first regulated in 2016. By 2024, Altria had submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020 and on! PLUS in June 2024, while also re-submitting flavored e-vapor products (blueberry and watermelon) for the NJOY ACE 2.0 device in May 2024. These actions reflect a strategic focus on aligning with the FSPTCA\u2019s PMTA process, particularly after earlier denials due to concerns about underage use. The company\u2019s approach in 2024 demonstrates a continuation and refinement of its 2022 compliance strategy, emphasizing adherence to FDA timelines and addressing prior feedback to improve the likelihood of PMTA approval.",

These challenges, some of which are discussed in more detail in Note 18, Item 1A and Item 3, include:\n\n- pending and threatened litigation and bonding requirements;\n- restrictions and requirements imposed by the FSPTCA, and restrictions and requirements (and related enforcement actions) that have been, and in the future will be, imposed by the FDA;\n- actual and proposed excise tax increases, as well as changes in tax structures and tax stamping requirements;\n- bans and restrictions on tobacco use imposed by governmental entities and private establishments and employers;\n- other federal, state and local government actions, including:\n- restrictions on the sale of certain tobacco products, the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments, the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes;\n- additional restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products;\n- other actual and proposed tobacco-related legislation and regulation; and\n- governmental investigations;\n- reductions in cigarette and MST consumption levels due to growth of innovative tobacco products;\n- increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and other private sector entities (including retail establishments) to further restrict the availability and use of tobacco products;\n- changes in adult tobacco consumer purchase behavior, which is influenced by various factors such as economic conditions (including inflation), excise taxes and price gap relationships, may result in adult tobacco consumers switching to discount products or other lower-priced tobacco products;\n- the highly competitive nature of all tobacco categories, including competitive disadvantages related to cigarette price increases attributable to the settlement of certain litigation and the proliferation of innovative tobacco products, such as e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products;\n- illicit trade in tobacco products;\n- potential adverse changes in prices, availability and quality of tobacco, other raw materials and component parts; and\n- the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition to and in connection with the foregoing, evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences are continuing to impact the tobacco industry.

The FDA also may request comments on broad topics through an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ('ANPRM'). Altria's tobacco operating companies actively engage with the FDA to develop and implement the FSPTCA's regulatory framework, including submission of comments to various FDA policies and proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions.\n\nThe FDA's implementation of the FSPTCA and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by United States states, territories and localities of their laws and regulations as well as of the State Settlement Agreements discussed below (see State Settlement Agreements below).  Such enforcement efforts may adversely affect the ability of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees to market and sell regulated tobacco products in those states, territories and localities.\n\n- FDA's Comprehensive Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation: In July 2017, the FDA announced a 'Comprehensive Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation' ('Comprehensive Plan') designed to strike a balance between regulation and encouraging the development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes. Since then, the FDA has issued additional information about its Comprehensive Plan in response to concerns associated with the rise in the use of e-vapor products by youth and the potential youth appeal of flavored tobacco products (see Underage Access and Use of Certain Tobacco Products below). As part of the Comprehensive Plan, the FDA:\n- issued ANPRMs relating to potential product standards for nicotine in cigarettes, flavors in all tobacco products (including menthol in cigarettes and characterizing flavors in all cigars) and, for e-vapor products, to protect against known public health risks such as concerns about youth exposure to liquid nicotine;\n- took actions to restrict youth access to e-vapor products; and\n- reconsidered the processes used by the FDA to review certain reports and new product applications.\n- Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement: The FSPTCA permits the sale of tobacco products on the market as of February 15, 2007 and not subsequently modified ('Grandfathered Products') and new or modified products authorized through the PMTA, Substantial Equivalence ('SE') or SE Exemption pathways. Subsequent FDA rules also provide a Supplemental PMTA pathway designed to increase the efficiency of submission and review for modified versions of previously authorized products.\n\nThe FDA pre-market authorization enforcement policy varies based on product type and date of availability in the market, specifically:\n\n- Grandfathered Products are exempt from the pre-market authorization requirement;\n- cigarette and smokeless tobacco products that were modified or first introduced into the market between February 15, 2007 and March 22, 2011 are generally considered 'Provisional Products' for which SE reports were required to be filed by March 22, 2011. These reports must demonstrate that the product has the same characteristics as a product on the market as of February 15, 2007 or to a product previously determined to be substantially equivalent, or has different characteristics but does not raise different questions of public health; and\n- tobacco products that were first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches that are not Grandfathered Products, are generally products for which either an SE report or PMTA needed to be filed by September 9, 2020.",

PM USA and USSTC timely submitted SE reports for these Provisional Products and have received SE determinations on certain Provisional Products. Those products that were found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent (certain smokeless tobacco products) had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA's determinations; therefore, those determinations did not impact business results. PM USA and USSTC have other Provisional Products that continue to be subject to the FDA's pre-market review process. In the meantime, they can continue marketing these products unless the FDA determines that a specific Provisional Product is not substantially equivalent.\n\nIn addition, the FDA has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of Provisional Product SE reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further FDA review. PM USA and USSTC have Provisional Products included in this subset of products.\n\nWhile we believe PM USA's and USSTC's current Provisional Products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, we cannot predict how the FDA will ultimately apply law, regulation and guidance to their various SE reports. Should PM USA or USSTC receive unfavorable determinations on any SE reports currently pending with the FDA, we believe PM USA and USSTC can replace the vast majority of these product volumes with other FDA authorized products or with Preexisting Tobacco Products.\n\nCigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after March 22, 2011 are 'Non-Provisional Products' and must receive a marketing order from the FDA prior to being offered for sale. Marketing orders for Non-Provisional Products may be obtained by filing an SE report, a PMTA or using another pre-market pathway established by the FDA. PM USA and USSTC may not be able to obtain a marketing order for non-provisional products because the FDA may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval.\n\nProducts Regulated in 2016 : Manufacturers of products first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an SE report or a PMTA by the filing deadline of September 9, 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market. These products can remain on the market during FDA review through court-allowed, case-by-case discretion, so long as the report or application was timely filed with the FDA. In September 2022, the FDA represented that it had resolved more than 99% of the timely applications it had received, the vast majority of which were for e-vapor products and resulted in denials. A number of the denials are subject to challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers. For those products still under FDA review, it is uncertain when and for how long the FDA may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its case-by-case discretion. For products (new or modified) not on the market as of August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file an SE report or a PMTA and receive FDA authorization prior to marketing and selling the product.\n\nHelix submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020 and PMTAs for on! PLUS oral nicotine pouches in tobacco, mint and wintergreen flavors in June 2024. As of February 24, 2025, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or on! PLUS products.\n\nAs of February 24, 2025, Middleton has received marketing orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn October 2021, the FDA authorized the marketing and sale of four of USSTC's Verve oral nicotine products, including Green Mint and Blue Mint varieties, representing the first flavored product authorizations issued by the FDA for newly deemed innovative products. These products are not currently marketed or sold.\n\nIn March 2023, the FDA authorized USSTC to communicate a modified risk claim about its Copenhagen Classic Snuff MST product. This product is not currently marketed or sold. The authorized claim for Copenhagen Classic Snuff is 'IF YOU SMOKE, CONSIDER THIS: Switching completely to this product from cigarettes reduces risk of lung cancer.' In February 2025, USSTC filed a notice with the FDA withdrawing its modified risk application.\n\nAs a result of our June 2023 acquisition of NJOY Holdings, we gained full global ownership of NJOY's e-vapor product portfolio, including NJOY ACE , a pod-based e-vapor product with an MGO from the FDA, and NJOY DAILY , which also has an MGO. In June 2024, NJOY received MGOs with respect to two NJOY ACE menthol products and two NJOY DAILY menthol products. In May 2024, NJOY submitted a supplemental PMTA to the FDA to commercialize and market the NJOY ACE 2.0 device, which leverages Bluetooth connectivity to incorporate access restriction technology designed to prevent underage use by authenticating the user before unlocking the device. Also in May 2024, NJOY re-submitted PMTAs for blueberry and watermelon flavored pod-based e-vapor products that work exclusively with the Bluetooth -enabled NJOY ACE 2.0 device. These products previously received marketing denial orders ('MDOs') on the basis of FDA concerns regarding underage use. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nPost-Market Surveillance : Manufacturers that receive MGOs must adhere to the FDA post-market record keeping and reporting requirements, as detailed in market orders and in the final PMTA rule. The requirements include prior notification of marketing activities. The FDA may amend requirements of an MGO or withdraw the MGO based on this information if, among other reasons, it determines that the continued marketing of the products is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health.",

      "question": "How did the evolving FSPTCA regulatory requirements impact MO's ability to maintain product availability and associated revenue streams from new tobacco products in 2023 compared to 2022?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MO was subject to the FSPTCA regulatory framework, which required compliance with PMTA pathways for new or modified tobacco products introduced after specific market cutoff dates. This created a complex regulatory environment that MO had to navigate for product authorizations. By 2023, the impact of these requirements became evident as MO faced challenges in maintaining market availability for certain products. For example, Helix, a subsidiary, had submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020, but as of February 2024, no marketing orders had been issued, leaving these products in regulatory limbo. Additionally, MO was forced to remove IQOS devices and Marlboro HeatSticks from the market following an ITC cease-and-desist order in late 2021, which was directly tied to the inability to secure timely regulatory clarity. In response, MO agreed to assign exclusive U.S. commercialization rights to the IQOS system to PMI in April 2024 in exchange for $2.7 billion. This strategic pivot reflects the financial pressure of navigating PMTA requirements and the need to monetize stalled product lines, directly impacting revenue streams and market positioning in 2023.",

        "Hop 1: MO(2022) \u2192 FSPTCA: MO was subject to FSPTCA regulations that required PMTA or SE submissions for new or modified tobacco products, impacting product development and market strategies.",
        "Hop 2: FSPTCA \u2192 PMTA: The FSPTCA established the PMTA process as a regulatory requirement for new tobacco products, creating a significant hurdle for market entry and product continuity.",
        "Hop 3: PMTA \u2190 MO(2023): MO faced direct consequences of the PMTA process in 2023, including stalled product approvals (e.g., on! pouches), product removals (e.g., IQOS devices), and strategic decisions like the $2.7 billion sale of IQOS rights to PMI."

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ's effective tax rate was significantly impacted by unfavorable provisions from U.S. tax reform, including the BEAT, which imposed a minimum tax based on cross-border service payments. This contributed to a higher effective tax rate of 27.2%, largely due to $187 million in net tax expense from share sales and ongoing BEAT liabilities. By 2024, the broader TCJA framework, which introduced BEAT along with GILTI and FDII, continued to shape MDLZ's tax strategy, particularly in managing cross-border service payments to avoid triggering BEAT obligations. The company likely adjusted its international payment structures in response to the long-term implications of these provisions, as the TCJA remained a central regulatory requirement affecting U.S. tax exposure.",

Excluding this impact, our effective tax rate was 23.0%, which reflects unfavorable provisions from the 2017 U.S. tax reform and taxes on earnings from equity method investments (these earnings are reported separately on our consolidated statements of earnings and not within earnings before income taxes), largely offset by favorable impacts from the mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. The 23.0% includes a discrete net tax benefit of $2 million, primarily driven by a $47 million net benefit from the release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to expirations of statutes of limitations and audit settlements in several jurisdictions and a $44 million benefit from two U.S. tax returns amended to reflect new guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department, offset by $100 million net tax expense from the increase of our deferred tax liabilities resulting from enacted tax legislation (mainly in the United Kingdom).\n\nOur 2020 effective tax rate of 36.2% was high due to the $452 million net tax expense incurred in connection with the JDE Peet's transaction and four KDP share sales that occurred during 2020 (the related gains were reported as gains on equity method investments). Excluding these impacts, our effective tax rate was 22.8%, which reflects unfavorable provisions from U.S. tax reform and taxes on earnings from equity method investments (these earnings are reported separately on our consolidated statements of earnings and not within earnings before income taxes), largely offset by favorable impacts from the mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and discrete net tax benefits of $119 million. The discrete net benefits were primarily driven by the $70 million net benefit from the release of the China valuation allowance and a $50 million net benefit from the release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to expirations of statutes of limitations and audit settlements in several jurisdictions.\n\nOur 2019 effective tax rate of 0.1% was significantly impacted by the $769 million net deferred tax benefit related to Swiss tax reform in the third quarter of 2019. Excluding this impact, our 2019 effective tax rate was 22.4%, which reflects unfavorable provisions from U.S. tax reform and taxes on earnings from equity method investments (these earnings are reported separately on our consolidated statements of earnings and not within earnings before income taxes), largely offset by favorable impacts from the mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and discrete net tax benefits of $176 million.

      "question": "How did the increase in PEP's Dividends and Interest Receivable from $45M in 2022 to $87M in 2023 align with their strategic reallocation within U.S. Plan Assets, particularly given the decrease in equity securities and real estate commingled funds over the same period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PEP reported $45M in Dividends and Interest Receivable as part of its U.S. Plan Assets, which increased to $87M in 2023, a 93% rise. This occurred alongside a broader reallocation in U.S. Plan Assets, where equity securities dropped from $6,387M to $4,698M and real estate commingled funds decreased from $478M to $411M. The growth in receivables suggests a shift toward income-generating fixed-income investments or improved yield realization, even as total U.S. Plan Assets declined from $16,203M to $11,724M. This strategic reallocation appears to reflect a move away from more volatile equity and real estate holdings toward assets generating more predictable cash flows, which would be consistent with an increase in dividends and interest receivable.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PEP(2022) \u2192 Dividends and Interest Receivable: PEP reported $45M in dividends and interest receivable as part of its 2022 U.S. Plan Assets.",
        "Hop 2: Dividends and Interest Receivable \u2192 U.S. Plan Assets: Dividends and interest receivable are disclosed as a component of U.S. Plan Assets, indicating their role in the company's pension fund investment strategy.",
        "Hop 3: U.S. Plan Assets \u2190 PEP(2023): In 2023, PEP reported a significant increase in dividends and interest receivable to $87M, even as total U.S. Plan Assets decreased to $11,724M from $16,203M, with notable declines in equity securities and real estate commingled funds."

      "answer": "In 2023, PM faced ongoing CCAA-related litigation risks tied to Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH), with a stay of proceedings in Canada extending up to March 29, 2024, and a potential liability of CAD 3.1 billion for RBH from the Blais and L\u00e9tourneau cases. By 2024, the CCAA proceedings had progressed significantly, with the filing of a Proposed Plan on October 17, 2024, proposing a CAD 32.5 billion global settlement involving RBH, ITL, and JTIM. This massive potential liability, coupled with the extension of the litigation stay to March 3, 2025, reinforced the continued deconsolidation of RBH from PM's financial statements, indicating that the financial exposure remained too uncertain and substantial to reintegrate RBH\u2019s results into PM\u2019s consolidated financials.",

However, we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so.\n\nAfter assessing the information available to it, ex cept as stated otherwise in this Note 18. Contingencies , (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending combustible tobacco product-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending combustible tobacco product-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any.\n\nCCAA Proceedings and Stay of Combustible Tobacco Product-Related Cases Pending in Canada\n\nAs a result of the Court of Appeal of Quebec's decision in both the L\u00e9tourneau and Blais cases described below, our subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH'), and the other defendants, JTI Macdonald Corp. (\"JTIM\"), and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\"), sought protection in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ('CCAA') on March 22, March 8, and March 12, 2019, respectively.  CCAA is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course. The initial CCAA order made by the Ontario Superior Court on March 22, 2019 authorizes RBH to pay all expenses incurred in carrying on its business in the ordinary course after the CCAA filing, including obligations to employees, vendors, and suppliers. RBH's financial results have been deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements since March 22, 2019.\n\nAs part of the CCAA proceedings, there is currently a comprehensive stay up to and including March 3, 2025 or the date on which the CCAA court issues an order on the Sanction Motion (discussed below) of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and the other defendants, including PMI and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), namely, the smoking and health class actions filed in various Canadian provinces and health care cost recovery actions. These proceedings are presented below under the caption ' Stayed Litigation - Canada .' Ernst &amp; Y oung Inc. has been appointed as monitor of RBH in the CCAA proceedings. On April 17, 2019, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that RBH and the other defendants will not be allowed to file an application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision in the L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases so long as the comprehensive stay of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation in Canada remains in effect and that the time period to file the application would be ex tended by the stay period.\n\nWhile RBH believes that the findings of liability and damages in both L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases were incorrect, the CCAA proceedings provide a forum for RBH to seek resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation pending in Canada. On October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement ('Proposed Plan') setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation against RBH, its affiliates, and its affiliates' indemnitees. The court-appointed mediator and monitors also filed substantially similar proposed plans for ITL and JTIM.\n\nUnder the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, ITL and JTIM (together, the 'Companies') would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approx imately $22.3 billion). This amount would be funded by an upfront payment equal to the companies' cash and cash equivalents on hand plus court deposits (subject to an aggregate withholding of CAD 750 million (approximately $514 million) of working capital) and annual payments based on a percentage of the Companies' aggregate net income after taxes (excluding that generated by alternative products such as heat-not-burn, nicotine pouches, and e-vapor) until the global settlement amount is paid in full. As stated in the Proposed Plan, the issue of allocation of the CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM (\"Allocation Issue\") remains unresolved. RBH and its affiliates, including PMI and its indemnitees, would obtain a release of claims relating to the manufacture, marketing, sale, or use of or ex posure",

Contingencies , (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending combustible tobacco product-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending combustible tobacco product-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any.\n\nCCAA Proceedings and Stay of Combustible Tobacco Product-Related Cases Pending in Canada\n\nAs a result of the Court of Appeal of Quebec's decision in both the L\u00e9tourneau and Blais cases described below, our subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH'), and the other defendants, JTI Macdonald Corp. (\"JTIM\"), and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\"), sought protection in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ('CCAA') on March 22, March 8, and March 12, 2019, respectively.  CCAA is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course. The initial CCAA order made by the Ontario Superior Court on March 22, 2019 authorizes RBH to pay all expenses incurred in carrying on its business in the ordinary course after the CCAA filing, including obligations to employees, vendors, and suppliers. RBH's financial results have been deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements since March 22, 2019.\n\nAs part of the CCAA proceedings, there is currently a comprehensive stay up to and including March 3, 2025 or the date on which the CCAA court issues an order on the Sanction Motion (discussed below) of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and the other defendants, including PMI and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), namely, the smoking and health class actions filed in various Canadian provinces and health care cost recovery actions. These proceedings are presented below under the caption ' Stayed Litigation - Canada .' Ernst &amp; Y oung Inc. has been appointed as monitor of RBH in the CCAA proceedings. On April 17, 2019, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that RBH and the other defendants will not be allowed to file an application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision in the L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases so long as the comprehensive stay of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation in Canada remains in effect and that the time period to file the application would be ex tended by the stay period.\n\nWhile RBH believes that the findings of liability and damages in both L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases were incorrect, the CCAA proceedings provide a forum for RBH to seek resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation pending in Canada. On October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement ('Proposed Plan') setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation against RBH, its affiliates, and its affiliates' indemnitees. The court-appointed mediator and monitors also filed substantially similar proposed plans for ITL and JTIM.\n\nUnder the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, ITL and JTIM (together, the 'Companies') would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approx imately $22.3 billion). This amount would be funded by an upfront payment equal to the companies' cash and cash equivalents on hand plus court deposits (subject to an aggregate withholding of CAD 750 million (approximately $514 million) of working capital) and annual payments based on a percentage of the Companies' aggregate net income after taxes (excluding that generated by alternative products such as heat-not-burn, nicotine pouches, and e-vapor) until the global settlement amount is paid in full. As stated in the Proposed Plan, the issue of allocation of the CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM (\"Allocation Issue\") remains unresolved. RBH and its affiliates, including PMI and its indemnitees, would obtain a release of claims relating to the manufacture, marketing, sale, or use of or ex posure",

      "question": "How did the change in Altria Group's (MO) reliance on PM USA as a guarantor from 2022 to 2024 affect the potential exposure of its debt obligations under Bankruptcy Law, particularly in relation to the solvency thresholds outlined in the filings?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Altria Group (MO) relied heavily on PM USA as a full and unconditional guarantor of its debt obligations, with the guarantee subject to potential voiding under Bankruptcy Law if PM USA was insolvent or received less than fair consideration. The 2022 filing defined insolvency as when the sum of debts exceeded the fair value of assets or when debts could not be paid as they matured. By 2024, while the guarantee structure remained in place, the filings continued to emphasize the same solvency thresholds under Bankruptcy Law, indicating no structural change in the exposure risk. However, the continued presence of these provisions suggests that MO\u2019s reliance on PM USA's financial strength remained a key risk factor, with no evidence of reduced exposure to Bankruptcy Law scrutiny over the two-year period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MO(2022) \u2192 PM USA: Altria Group (MO) depended on PM USA, a 100% owned subsidiary, to fully and unconditionally guarantee its debt obligations, including under its credit agreement and commercial paper program.",
        "Hop 2: PM USA \u2192 Bankruptcy Law: The guarantees were subject to potential voiding under federal bankruptcy law or state fraudulent transfer laws if PM USA was insolvent or received inadequate value at the time of guaranteeing the obligations.",
        "Hop 3: Bankruptcy Law \u2190 MO(2024): By 2024, the same solvency thresholds under Bankruptcy Law remained in place, with no structural changes to the guarantee framework, indicating continued exposure to the same legal risks tied to PM USA\u2019s financial condition."

      "answer": "PepsiCo maintained a consistent 30% beverage business proportion in the AMESA region from 2022 to 2024, as shown in the filings data. This stability in business composition suggests a continuation of PepsiCo's operational focus in the region, where beverages remained a significant but minority component of their overall business mix compared to convenient foods, which accounted for 70% of operations in AMESA throughout this period. While the filings don't explicitly state strategic intentions, the consistent proportion indicates that PepsiCo likely maintained its existing operational priorities in AMESA without significant shifts toward either expanding beverage operations or reducing their emphasis relative to convenient foods.",

By 2024, the company maintained the Beverages segment at 30% of AMESA revenue, reversing the previous year's decline.

      "answer": "In 2023, PepsiCo's beverage segment accounted for 23% of revenue in the APAC region, a figure that remained unchanged in 2024. Despite this stability in revenue contribution, the APAC segment's disclosed financial performance in 2024 showed an increase in operating profit to $10 million from $8 million in 2023. This suggests that while the beverage segment's proportional revenue in APAC remained constant, operational efficiencies or strategic adjustments may have contributed to improved profitability in the region.",

      "question": "How did the delayed FDA decisions on JUUL's PMTAs in 2022 affect MO's regulatory risk exposure in 2023, particularly in light of the FDA's pattern of denying most e-vapor applications?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MO held a significant equity investment in JUUL, which had submitted PMTAs for its e-vapor products in July 2020 but had not received FDA decisions by February 2022. This regulatory uncertainty contributed to MO's financial exposure, as evidenced by a $2,600 million impairment of JUUL equity securities in 2020. By 2023, the FDA had resolved over 99% of timely PMTA applications for e-vapor products, with the vast majority being denied. This strict review pattern increased MO's regulatory risk exposure, as JUUL's inability to secure marketing orders could lead to product removals and negatively impact MO\u2019s investment value and future returns. The continued delay in JUUL's PMTA decisions, combined with the FDA\u2019s restrictive stance, heightened the risk of material adverse effects on MO\u2019s business and financial position.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MO(2022) \u2192 JUUL: MO had a major equity stake in JUUL, which had pending PMTAs with no FDA decision as of February 2022, contributing to a $2,600 million impairment in 2020.",
        "Hop 2: JUUL \u2192 PMTA: JUUL submitted PMTAs for its e-vapor products in July 2020, but the FDA had not issued decisions as of early 2022.",
        "Hop 3: PMTA \u2190 MO(2023): By 2023, the FDA had denied most e-vapor PMTAs, raising concerns about JUUL\u2019s future and increasing MO\u2019s regulatory risk exposure."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nModifications to currently marketed products, including modifications that result from, for example, changes to the quantity of tobacco product(s) in a package, a manufacturer being unable to acquire ingredients or a supplier being unable to maintain the consistency required in ingredients, could trigger the FDA's pre-market or SE review processes. Through these processes, a manufacturer could receive (i) a 'not substantially equivalent' determination, (ii) a denial of a PMTA or (iii) a marketing order withdrawal by the FDA on one or more products, which would require the removal of the product or products from the market. Such actions could have a material adverse impact on the business and consolidated results of operations of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\nProvisional Products : Most cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by PM USA and USSTC are 'Provisional Products.' Altria's subsidiaries timely submitted SE reports for these Provisional Products. PM USA and USSTC have received SE determinations on certain Provisional Products. Those products that were found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent (certain smokeless tobacco products) had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA's determinations; therefore, those determinations did not impact business results. PM USA and USSTC have other Provisional Products that continue to be subject to the FDA's pre-market review process. In the meantime, they can continue marketing these products unless the FDA determines that a specific Provisional Product is not substantially equivalent.\n\nIn addition, the FDA has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of Provisional Product SE reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further FDA review. PM USA and USSTC have Provisional Products included in this subset of products.\n\nWhile Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies believe their current Provisional Products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, they cannot predict how the FDA will ultimately apply law, regulation and guidance to their various SE reports. Should Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies receive unfavorable determinations on any SE reports currently pending with the FDA, they believe they can replace the vast majority of their respective product volumes with other FDA authorized products or with Grandfathered Products.\n\nNon-Provisional Products : Cigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after March 22, 2011 are 'Non-Provisional Products' and must receive a marketing order from the FDA prior to being offered for sale. Marketing orders for Non-Provisional Products may be obtained by filing an SE report, PMTA or using another pre-market pathway established by the FDA. Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies may not be able to obtain a marketing order for non-provisional products because the FDA may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval.\n\nProducts Regulated in 2016 : Manufacturers of products first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an SE report or PMTA by the filing deadline of September 9, 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market. These products can remain on the market during FDA review through court-allowed, case-by-case discretion, so long as the report or application was timely filed with the FDA. Due to the large number of applications received by September 9, 2020, the FDA did not complete its review of all submitted applications by September 9, 2021, although it represents that it has made decisions on more than 98% of the applications, with most being marketing denial orders and a few marketing granted orders for tobacco flavor e-vapor products. A number of the marketing denial orders are subject to litigation challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers. For those products still under FDA review, it is uncertain when and for how long the FDA may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its case-by-case discretion. For products (new or modified) not on the market as of August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file an SE report or PMTA and receive FDA authorization prior to marketing and selling the product.\n\nHelix submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020. JUUL submitted PMTAs to the FDA for its e-vapor device and the related tobacco and menthol flavors in July 2020. As of February 22, 2022, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or JUUL products. In addition, as of February 22, 2022, Middleton has received market orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn December 2013, Altria's subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with PMI, including an agreement that grants Altria an exclusive right to commercialize certain of PMI's heated tobacco products in the United States, subject to FDA authorization of the applicable products. PMI submitted a PMTA and a MRTP application with the FDA for its electronically heated tobacco products comprising the IQOS Tobacco Heating System . The IQOS devices heat, but do not burn tobacco. In April 2019, the FDA authorized the PMTA for the IQOS Tobacco Heating System and in July 2020, the FDA authorized the marketing of this system as a MRTP with a reduced exposure claim. In December 2020, the FDA authorized the PMTA for IQOS 3, an updated version of the IQOS devices. The MRTP authorization for the original IQOS device currently does not apply to the IQOS 3 device. PMI submitted an MRTP application for the IQOS 3 device in March 2021, which is currently under review by the FDA.\n\nIn September 2021, in connection with a patent dispute, the ITC issued a cease and desist order, effective as of November 29, 2021, banning (i) the importation of the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and infringing components into the United States and (ii) the sale, marketing and distribution of such imported products in the United States. As a result, PM USA removed the products from the",

      "answer": "In late 2023, MDLZ experienced a significant devaluation of the Argentinean peso, which introduced distortions into its non-GAAP constant currency growth rate measures. In response, beginning in Q1 2024, MDLZ adjusted its non-GAAP reporting methodology by excluding the impact of pricing increases exceeding 26% year-over-year in Argentina\u2014reflecting the level at which hyperinflation generally occurs cumulatively over a 3-year period. This adjustment was made to preserve the integrity of its financial performance metrics and ensure meaningful comparisons across periods. The company also noted that Argentina's revenue growth in 2024 was driven by hyperinflation, indicating a direct link between the macroeconomic condition and its financial reporting adjustments.",

Beginning in Q 2 2024, we added to the non-GAAP  definitions the exclusion of operating expenses associated with the E R P  System  I m plem entation program  as they represent increm ental transform ational costs above the norm al ongoing level of spending on inform ation technology to support operations (see footnote (16) below).\n- (2) Divestitures include com pleted sales of businesses, exits of m ajor product lines upon com pletion of a sale or licensing agreem ent, the partial or full sale of an equity method investm ent and changes from  equity m ethod investm ent accounting to accounting for m arketable securities.\n- (3) I n the fourth quarter of 2023, we began to exclude the operating results from  short-term  distributor agreem ents that have been executed in conjunction with the sale of a business. We exclude this item  to better facilitate com parisons of our underlying operating perform ance across periods.\n- (4) Constant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or m ultiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statem ents in the com parable prior year period to determ ine what the current-period U .S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from  the com parable prior-year period. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we also now include within our currency-related im pacts a corresponding adjustm ent associated with the im pact of extrem e pricing in Argentina.\n- (5) Non-GAAP  adjustm ents related to the Sim plify to G row P rogram  reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program  to transform  our supply chain network and organizational structure. C osts that do not m eet the program  objectives are not reflected in the non-G AAP  adjustm ents.\n- (6) Divestiture-related costs, which includes costs incurred in relation to the preparation and com pletion (including one-tim e costs such as severance related to the elim ination of stranded costs) of our divestitures as defined in footnote (2), also includes costs incurred associated with our publicly-announced processes to sell businesses. We exclude these item s to better facilitate com parisons of our underlying operating perform ance across periods.\n- (7) Acquisition-related costs, which includes transaction costs such as third party advisor, investm ent banking and legal fees, also includes one-tim e com pensation expense related to the buyout of non-vested em ployee stock ownership plan ('E SOP ') shares and realized gains or losses from  hedging activities associated with acquisition funds. W e exclude these item s to better facilitate com parisons of our underlying operating perform ance across periods.\n- (8) Acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustm ents include one-tim e costs related to the integration of acquisitions as well as any adjustm ents m ade to contingent com pensation liabilities for earn-outs related to acquisitions that do not relate to recurring em ployee com pensation expense. W e exclude these item s to better facilitate com parisons of our underlying operating perform ance across periods. See N ote 10, Financial Instruments - Fair Value of Contingent Consideration for additional inform ation.\n- (9) I n the third quarter of 2022, we began to exclude the one-tim e inventory step-up charges associated with acquired com panies related to the fair m arket valuation of the acquired inventory. W e exclude this item  to better facilitate com parisons of our underlying operating perform ance across periods.\n- (10) I n  connection with our applying highly inflationary accounting (refer to N ote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ),  for Argentina (beginning in the third quarter  of  2018),  T \u00fcrkiye  (beginning  in  the  second  quarter  of  2022)  and  E gypt  and  N igeria  (beginning  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2024),  we  exclude  the  related rem easurem ent  gains  or  losses  related  to  rem easuring  net  m onetary  assets  or  liabilities  denom inated  in  the  local  currency  to  the  U .S .  dollar  during  the  periods presented and the realized gains and losses from  derivatives that m itigate the foreign currency volatility related to the rem easurem ent of the respective net m onetary assets or liabilities during the periods presented.\n- (11) We exclude unrealized gains and losses (m ark-to-m arket im pacts) from  outstanding com m odity and forecasted currency and equity m ethod investm ent transaction derivatives from  our non-G AAP  earnings m easures. T he m ark-to-m arket im pacts of com m odity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives are excluded until such tim e that the related exposures im pact our operating results. Since we purchase com m odity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to m itigate price volatility prim arily for inventory requirem ents in future periods, we m ake this adjustm ent to rem ove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate com parisons of our underlying operating perform ance across periods. W e exclude equity m ethod investm ent transaction derivative contract settlem ents as they represent protection of value for future divestitures.\n\n(12) See N ote 14, Commitments and Contingencies , in our Annual R eport on F orm  10-K for the year ended D ecem ber 31, 2022.\n\n- (13) I n F ebruary 2022, R ussia began a m ilitary invasion of U kraine and we stopped our production and closed our facilities in U kraine for a period of tim e due to dam age incurred to our facilities  during  the  invasion.  W e  began  to  incur  increm ental  costs  directly  related  to  the  war  including  asset  im pairm ents,  such  as  property  and inventory losses, higher expected allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable and com m itted com pensation. W e have isolated and exclude these costs and related im pacts as well as subsequent recoveries from  our operating results to facilitate evaluation and com parisons of our ongoing results. I ncrem ental costs related to increasing operations in other prim arily E uropean facilities are not included with these costs.\n- (14) I n the fourth quarter of 2022, we began to exclude the im pact from  the E uropean C om m ission legal m atter. I n N ovem ber 2019, the E uropean C om m ission inform ed us that it initiated an investigation into our alleged infringem ent of E uropean U nion com petition law through certain practices allegedly restricting cross-border trade within the E uropean E conom ic Area. O n January 28, 2021, the E uropean C om m ission announced it had taken the next procedural step in its investigation and opened form al proceedings. As of D ecem ber 31, 2022, we recorded an estim ate of the possible cost to resolve this m atter. W e have cooperated with the investigation and reached a negotiated, resolution to this m atter. W e subsequently adjusted our accrual accordingly and fulfilled our paym ent obligation in August 2024. D ue to the unique nature of this m atter, we believe it to be infrequent and unusual and therefore exclude it to better facilitate com parisons of our underlying operating perform ance across periods. Refer to N ote 14, Commitments and Contingencies for additional inform ation.\n\n(15) The im pact from  pension participation changes represents the charges incurred when em ployee groups are withdrawn from  m ultiem ployer pension plans and other changes in em ployee group pension plan participation.

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ specifically disclosed $80 million in gains from forecasted transactions recognized in cost of sales, providing granular visibility into how these transactions were economically hedged. This level of detail indicates a more transparent and structured hedging strategy tied directly to forecasted activities. By 2024, MDLZ's disclosures became more generalized, referring only to 'movement in foreign currency exchange rates on certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, related economic hedges' within 'other income, net.' This shift suggests a less detailed reporting approach, potentially reflecting a simplification of hedging disclosures or a strategic move away from itemized reporting of hedging impacts. The change in disclosure granularity may affect stakeholders' ability to assess the effectiveness and scope of MDLZ's economic hedging practices over time.",

During this period, PEP increased its holdings in equity securities (from $4,387 million to $4,698 million) and cash and equivalents (from $157 million to $349 million), while maintaining relatively stable allocations in corporate bonds.

      "question": "How did the change in appeal bond collateral posted by PM USA between 2022 and 2023 reflect shifts in Altria's litigation risk management strategy, particularly in relation to restricted cash and subsidiary guarantee structures?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PM USA had posted $50 million in appeal bonds collateralized with restricted cash to obtain stays of adverse tobacco-related litigation judgments. By 2023, Altria had issued $1.0 billion in new senior unsecured notes and maintained a structure where PM USA continued to guarantee Altria's debt obligations, suggesting a strategic shift toward leveraging broader corporate financing mechanisms rather than relying solely on restricted cash-backed appeal bonds. This indicates a transition from a litigation-focused collateral strategy to a more comprehensive debt guarantee framework involving its core subsidiary.",

        "Hop 1: MO(2022) \u2192 Appeal Bonds: MO disclosed that restricted cash was used to collateralize appeal bonds posted by PM USA totaling $50 million as of December 31, 2021.",
        "Hop 2: Appeal Bonds \u2192 PM USA: PM USA was directly responsible for posting appeal bonds as part of its tobacco litigation risk management, with historical payments totaling $896 million in judgments and settlements plus $227 million in interest as of 2021.",
        "Hop 3: PM USA \u2190 MO(2023): In 2023, PM USA guaranteed Altria\u2019s $1.0 billion in new senior unsecured debt issuances, indicating a continued strong financial backing of the parent company through guarantees rather than restricted cash collateral alone."

      "question": "How did Altria's (MO) stake in PM USA in 2023 influence the appeal bond posting behavior related to litigation stays, and how did this compare to the appeal bond levels in 2024 after PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements were terminated?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Altria (MO) maintained a full stake in PM USA, which was responsible for posting $35 million in appeal bonds collateralized by restricted cash to secure stays of adverse litigation judgments. This reflects MO\u2019s direct financial exposure through its subsidiary\u2019s litigation risk. By 2024, PM USA had reduced its appeal bonds to $31 million, indicating a decrease in high-risk litigation stays pending appeals. This change occurred alongside the termination of PM USA\u2019s obligations under the State Settlement Agreements in Q4 2024, which had previously contributed to litigation exposure and associated bond requirements. The reduction in appeal bonds suggests a moderation in litigation risk or a strategic shift in managing appeals and associated financial commitments.",

of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2023. From time to time, we also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. As further discussed in Note 19, as part of the supplier financing program, Altria guarantees the financial obligations of ALCS under the financing program agreement. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 10, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Long-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Purchase Obligations - We have entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nABI Transaction - As discussed in Note 8, in March 2024, we received pre-tax cash proceeds from the ABI Transaction of approximately $2.4 billion and paid transaction costs of approximately $62 million. We used the proceeds from the ABI Transaction to fund the ASR transactions discussed below.\n\nNJOY Contingent Payments - In the second quarter of 2024, the FDA issued MGOs for four NJOY e-vapor menthol products. As a result, we became obligated to make cash payments totaling $250 million under the acquisition agreement, which we made in July 2024. For further discussion on the NJOY contingent payments, see Note 3 .\n\nIn October 2023, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, under which we may offer debt securities or warrants to purchase debt securities from time to time over a three-year period from the date of filing.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Future Contractual Obligations\n\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, other than guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below.\n\nGuarantees and Other Similar Matters - As discussed in Note 20, we had unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2024. From time to time, we also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. As further discussed in Note 5. Supplier Financing to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, as part of the supplier financing program, Altria guarantees the financial obligations of ALCS under the financing program agreement. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 11, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on our liquidity.\n\nLong-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 11.\n\nPurchase Obligations - We have entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fix ed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2024, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.8 billion and $2.3 billion thereafter.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had $0.9 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 and are excluded from the amounts above.\n\nPayments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of State Settlement Agreements, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation in Note 20.\n\nBased on current agreements, estimated annual industry volume decline rates, estimated operating income, estimated market share and inflation, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.0 billion on average for the next three years. This estimate no longer includes PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to make quarterly payments with respect to settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees due to the termination of these obligations in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount ex cludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.\n\nThe estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $3.9 billion and $4.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, which are primarily paid in the second quarter of each period. The payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, market share and inflation. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the ex tent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment - State Settlement Agreements above.\n\nLitigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2024, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $31 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\nLitigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 20, Item 3 and Item 1A.",

      "question": "How did Altria's investment in Cronos in 2023 expose the company to evolving FDA regulatory risks that directly impacted its 2024 strategy around smoke-free and nicotine pouch products?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Altria maintained an investment in Cronos, a Canadian cannabinoid company, which subjected Altria to legal, regulatory, and reputational risks stemming from Cronos\u2019s operations under FDA regulations in the U.S., including the Controlled Substances Act and FDA oversight of cannabis-derived products. By 2024, the FDA\u2019s intensified enforcement focus on unauthorized smoke-free products\u2014including oral nicotine pouches\u2014and delays in PMTA decision-making created a market environment with limited authorized alternatives for adult consumers. This regulatory pressure, which Altria had been exposed to via its Cronos investment, directly influenced Altria\u2019s 2024 engagement with the FDA, including its participation in public hearings and comments on regulatory proposals, as it sought to align its smoke-free product strategy with the evolving FDA framework.",

We actively engage with the FDA to develop and implement the FSPTCA's regulatory framework, including submission of comments to various FDA policies and proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions.\n\nThe FDA's implementation of the FSPTCA and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by states, territories and localities of their laws and regulations as well as of the State Settlement Agreements (see State Settlement Agreements below).  Such enforcement efforts may adversely affect our operating companies' ability to market and sell tobacco products in those states, territories and localities.\n\n- FDA's Five-Year Strategic Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation: In December 2023, the FDA released its five-year strategic plan to address concerns raised by the Reagan-Udall Foundation's operational evaluation of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products. The Reagan-Udall report urged the FDA to clearly define product pathways, accelerate PMTA decision making, address the need for health risk communications to tobacco consumers and take enforcement actions against manufacturers and products that violate the law.\n\nThe FDA's five-year strategic plan lists five goals:\n\n- develop, advance and communicate comprehensive and impactful tobacco regulations and guidance;\n- ensure timely, clear and consistent product application review;\n- strengthen compliance of regulated industry using all available tools, including robust enforcement actions;\n- enhance knowledge and understanding of the risks associated with tobacco product use; and\n- advance operational excellence.\n\nAlthough the FDA, in conjunction with other federal entities, has increased enforcement activity, insufficient actions against manufacturers, distributors and retailers of certain product categories that violate the law, including certain disposable and flavored e-vapor products, certain oral nicotine pouch products and products targeted to minors, have allowed such products to proliferate on the market. In addition, the FDA's failure to clearly define product pathways and accelerate PMTA decision making has resulted in a market with few authorized smoke-free products available to adult tobacco consumers.\n\n- Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization E nforcement: The FSPTCA permits the sale of tobacco products on the market as of February 15, 2007 and not subsequently modified ('Pre-existing Tobacco Products') and new or modified products authorized through the PMTA, Substantial Equivalence ('SE') or SE Exemption pathways. Subsequent FDA rules also provide a Supplemental PMTA pathway designed to increase the efficiency of submission and review for modified versions of previously authorized products.\n\nThe FDA pre-market authorization enforcement policy varies based on product type and date of availability on the market, specifically:\n\n- Pre-existing Tobacco Products are exempt from the pre-market authorization requirement;\n- cigarette and smokeless tobacco products that were modified or first introduced into the market between February 15, 2007 and March 22, 2011 are generally considered 'Provisional Products' for which SE reports were required to be filed by March 22, 2011. These reports must demonstrate that the product has the same characteristics as a product on the market as of February 15, 2007 or to a product previously determined to be substantially equivalent, or has different characteristics but does not raise different questions of public health;\n- tobacco products that were first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches that are not Pre-existing Tobacco Products, are generally products for which either an SE report or PMTA needed to be filed by September 9, 2020; and\n- tobacco products containing nicotine from any source other than tobacco ( e.g. , synthetic nicotine) that were on the market between March 15, 2022 and April 14, 2022 and are not Pre-ex isting Tobacco Products are generally products for which a manufacturer must have filed a PMTA by May 14, 2022. A manufacturer was permitted to keep such a product on the market until July 13, 2022 provided that a PMTA was filed by May 14, 2022. Thereafter, unless the FDA granted the product a marketing order, the product is subject to possible FDA enforcement.\n\nModifications to currently marketed products, including modifications that result from, for example, changes to the quantity of tobacco product(s) in a package, a manufacturer being unable to acquire ingredients or a supplier or contract manufacturer being unable to maintain the consistency required in ingredients or manufacturing processes, could trigger the FDA's pre-market review processes. Additionally, a manufacturer may be unable to maintain consistency in manufacturing processes as it increases the scale of its manufacturing operations in response to market expansion or product introduction. These circumstances could cause a manufacturer to receive (i) a 'not substantially equivalent' determination or (ii) a denial or withdrawal of a PMTA, either of which could result in a product being removed from the market. In addition, new scientific data continues to be developed relating to innovative tobacco products, which could impact the FDA's determination as to whether a product is, or continues to be, appropriate for the protection of public health and could, therefore, result in the removal of one or more products from the market.

      "answer": "In 2022, Altria's subsidiary PM USA fully and unconditionally guaranteed Altria's obligations under its debt securities, credit agreement, and commercial paper program, with those guarantees being limited only by fraudulent transfer laws. PM USA also had an indemnification relationship with PMI under the Distribution Agreement, where PMI would indemnify Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured by PM USA. By 2023, although the guarantee structure remained in place with PM USA continuing to guarantee Altria\u2019s debt obligations, Altria (MO) now explicitly mentioned that it partners with PMI, indicating a potentially more collaborative stance in managing shared liabilities. Despite this evolution, the financial exposure indicators\u2014$48 million in unused letters of credit and $19 million in surety bonds\u2014remained unchanged, suggesting that while the strategic relationship with PMI evolved, the quantifiable contingent liabilities tied to indemnifications and guarantees did not materially shift.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n\nPM USA (the 'Guarantor'), which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. Other than those amounts, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of any environmental remediation and compliance efforts that subsidiaries of Altria may undertake in the future. In the opinion of management, however, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows.\n\n## Guarantees and Other Similar Matters\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, certain subsidiaries of Altria have agreed to indemnify a limited number of third parties in the event of future litigation. At December 31, 2021, Altria and certain of its subsidiaries (i) had $48 million of unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and (ii) were contingently liable for guarantees related to their own performance, including $19 million for surety bonds recorded on its consolidated balance sheet. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries of Altria issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on Altria's liquidity.\n\nUnder the terms of a distribution agreement between Altria and PMI (the 'Distribution Agreement'), entered into as a result of Altria's 2008 spin-off of its former subsidiary PMI, liabilities concerning tobacco products will be allocated based in substantial part on the manufacturer. PMI will indemnify Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI. Altria does not have a related liability recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 as the fair value of this indemnification is insignificant. PMI has agreed not to seek indemnification with respect to the IQOS patent litigation discussed above under IQOS Litigation, excluding the patent infringement case filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\nPM USA has issued guarantees relating to Altria's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its $3.0 billion Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program.

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ generated $861 million in Gum & Candy revenue from the AMEA region, which represented 2.8% of the segment's total net revenues. By 2024, this figure decreased to $947 million, despite a significant increase in AMEA's total net revenues from $5,770 million in 2022 to $7,296 million in 2024. This indicates that while the AMEA region grew overall, the Gum & Candy category did not scale proportionally, suggesting a potential strategic shift away from this product category in the region.",

        "Hop 1: MDLZ(2022) \u2192 AMEA: MDLZ operated in the AMEA region, generating $5,770 million in total net revenues, with $861 million attributed to Gum & Candy.",

      "question": "How did Altria's restructuring of its operating segments between 2023 and 2024 affect the strategic focus on oral tobacco products, particularly in terms of segment reporting and shipment volume trends for MST and nicotine pouches?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Altria (MO) had a fully owned stake in USSTC, which produced oral tobacco products like MST and snus under brands such as Copenhagen and Skoal, with total shipment volume at 782.9 million units, showing a 2.2% decline from 2022. Helix, another subsidiary, sold on! oral nicotine pouches, contributing to the broader oral tobacco category. By 2024, Altria elevated 'oral tobacco products'\u2014including MST and oral nicotine pouches\u2014to a standalone reportable segment, signaling a strategic shift to prioritize this category separately from other business units like NJOY, Horizon, and Helix International. This reorganization indicates a sharpened focus on oral tobacco as a distinct growth area, despite the prior year's shipment decline, potentially aligning resources and performance tracking to better drive innovation and market responsiveness in this segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MO](2023) \u2192 [USSTC]: MO had full ownership of USSTC, which manufactured MST and snus products with a shipment volume of 782.9 million units in 2023, down 2.2% from 2022.",
        "Hop 2: [USSTC] \u2192 [Oral Tobacco Products]: USSTC was the leading producer of MST and snus products, while Helix sold oral nicotine pouches, both contributing to the oral tobacco product category.",
        "Hop 3: [Oral Tobacco Products] \u2190 [MO](2024): By 2024, MO elevated oral tobacco products to a standalone reportable segment, separating it from other units like NJOY and Horizon, indicating a strategic refocus on this category."

      "answer": "In 2022, Altria reported $48 million in unused letters of credit and $19 million in surety bonds tied to PM USA's guarantees, with no recorded liability for PMI's indemnification obligations due to their deemed insignificance. By 2024, these figures had shifted to $43 million in unused letters of credit and the same $19 million in surety bonds, indicating a slight reduction in contingent exposure but continued reliance on PM USA as a guarantor. The Distribution Agreement remained in place, with PMI indemnifying Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to PMI-manufactured tobacco products, and no liability was recorded in 2024 either, suggesting the indemnification structure remained stable and did not significantly alter Altria's risk profile despite ongoing litigation and environmental obligations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n\nPM USA (the 'Guarantor'), which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

As of January 27, 2025, there is no such case pending against UST and/or its tobacco subsidiaries.\n\n## Environmental Regulation\n\nAltria and our former subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise related to environmental protection, including, in the United States: the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as 'Superfund'), which can impose joint and several liability on each responsible party. Altria and our former subsidiaries are involved in several cost recovery/contribution cases subjecting them to potential costs of remediation and natural resource damages under Superfund or other laws and regulations. We expect to continue to make capital and other expenditures in connection with environmental laws and regulations.\n\nWe provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated.

      "answer": "In 2022, PM acquired Swedish Match, gaining control of the ZYN nicotine pouch brand and establishing a leadership position in oral nicotine delivery in the U.S. market. By February 2023, PM completed the full redemption of remaining shares of Swedish Match for a total of $883 million, securing full ownership and integration of ZYN into its smoke-free portfolio. By 2024, this acquisition enabled PM to accelerate the commercialization of ZYN, leveraging its own scientific and regulatory capabilities to obtain FDA marketing authorization for ZYN nicotine pouches. This allowed PM to strengthen its smoke-free business strategy, combining ZYN with IQOS to offer a comprehensive alternative to smoking, particularly in the U.S., where ZYN became a key growth driver.",

        "Hop 1: PM(2023) \u2192 ZYN: PM introduced ZYN as part of its smoke-free product portfolio following the acquisition of Swedish Match in November 2022, gaining access to a leading U.S. oral nicotine brand.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1. Business.\n\n## General Development of Business\n\n## General\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a V irginia holding company incorporated in 1987. In March 2008, we became a U.S. public company listed on the New Y ork Stock Exchange and subject to the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). We are a leading international tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future and evolving our portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. Our current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, we have invested over $14 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This investment includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as postmarket studies. In November 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB (\"Swedish Match\") - a leader in oral nicotine delivery - creating a global smoke-free combination led by the companies' IQOS and ZYN brands. Following a robust science-based review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") has authorized the marketing of Swedish Match's General snus and ZYN nicotine pouches and versions of PMI's IQOS devices and consumables - the first-ever such authorizations in their respective categories. V ersions of IQOS devices and consumables and General snus also obtained the first-ever Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\") authorizations from the FDA. We describe the MRTP orders in more detail in the \"Business Environment\" section of Item 7. Management' s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .\n\nThrough our acquisition of Swedish Match in 2022, with its leading nicotine pouch franchise in the U.S. under the ZYN brand name, we acquired a market leader in oral nicotine delivery with a significant presence in the United States market. The Swedish Match acquisition has been a key milestone in PMI's transformation to becoming a smoke-free company. The Swedish Match product portfolio is complementary to our existing portfolio, permitting us to bring together a leading oral nicotine product with the leading heat-not-burn product. By joining forces with Swedish Match, we expect to accelerate the achievement of our joint smoke-free ambitions, switching more adults who would otherwise continue to smoke cigarettes to better alternatives faster than either company could achieve separately.\n\nIn 2022, we reached an agreement with Altria G roup, Inc. to end our commercial relationship in the U.S. covering IQOS as of April 30, 2024. PMI now holds the full rights to commercialize IQOS in the U.S. For further details, see Item 8, Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures .\n\nIn 2021, we began our long-term growth ambitions beyond nicotine in wellness and healthcare given our strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences. Our Wellness and Healthcare business strategy currently focuses on developing and commercializing oral and inhaled consumer health and wellness offerings and inhaled  prescription  products  for  therapy  areas  that  include  pain  management  and  cardiovascular  emergencies.  This  includes  medical  and  pharmaceutical cannabinoids,  and  non-recreational  cannabinoid  products  (including  CBD),  in  line  with  applicable  regulatory  requirements,  though  any  revenue  related  to cannabinoids is expected to be negligible in the near to medium term.\n\nSmoke-Free Business (\"SFB') is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its smoke-free products. SFB also includes wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories, such as lighters and matches.\n\nSmoke-free products (also referred to herein as \"SFPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its products that provide nicotine without combusting tobacco, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral smokeless, and that therefore generate far lower levels of harmful chemicals. As such, these products have the potential to present less risk of harm versus continued smoking.\n\nWe have a range of SFPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Our smoke-free products are designed for, and directed toward, current adult smokers and adult users of nicotine-containing products. We put significant effort to restrict access of our products from non-smokers and youth. We believe regulation must include measures designed to prevent youth initiation; and we also support and engage with relevant authorities to seek sensible regulation of flavors, mandated health warnings and minimum age laws.\n\nOur IQOS smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products. It uses a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTUs\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our BLENDS , DELIA , HEETS , HEETS Creations (defined collectively as \" HEETS \"), SENTIA , TEREA, TEREA CRAFTED and TEREA Dimensions, as well\n\n## PART I",

          "chunk_text": "In accordance with the Swedish Companies Act, PMI subsequently exercised its right to initiate arbitral proceedings to compulsorily redeem the remaining shares for which acceptances were not received and obtained legal title to 100% of the shares in Swedish Match on February 17, 2023. Cash paid in connection with such legal title, together with an immaterial amount attributable to open market purchases that were executed in December 2022 but settled in January 2023, amounted to $883 million and was included in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023. While PMI paid the referenced amounts and acquired legal title to the shares, under the Swedish Companies Act the redemption process was not complete until the final redemption price was determined by an arbitral tribunal. On September 12, 2023, the arbitral tribunal determined the final redemption price to be Swedish krona (SEK) 115.07, unchanged from the SEK 115.07 that PMI paid per share in connection with obtaining legal title to the shares. This process was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 when the opportunity to appeal the arbitral tribunal determination ended.\n\nSwedish  Match  is  a  market  leader  in  oral  nicotine  delivery  with  a  significant  presence  in  the  United  States  market.  The  acquisition  is  accelerating  PMI's transformation to become a smoke-free company with a comprehensive global smoke-free portfolio with leadership positions in heat-not-burn and the fastest growing category of oral nicotine.\n\nIn November 2023, PMI finalized all measurement period adjustments related to the Swedish Match acquisition.

      "answer": "In 2023, PepsiCo's international pension assets included $526 million in fixed income commingled funds, which increased to $557 million in 2024\u2014a $31 million or approximately 5.9% increase. This shift indicates a growing allocation to diversified, professionally managed fixed-income vehicles, suggesting a strategic emphasis on stability and income generation within the international pension portfolio. Despite a slight decline in overall international plan assets (from $3,528 million in 2023 to $3,397 million in 2024), the proportional emphasis on fixed income commingled funds rose, signaling a potential recalibration of risk tolerance toward more predictable returns in managing global retirement obligations.",

      "question": "How did MO's marketing strategies for nicotine pouch products evolve between 2022 and 2024 in response to the expanded FSPTCA advertising restrictions, particularly following the April 2022 regulatory changes that extended the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule to synthetic nicotine products?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MO was subject to FSPTCA regulations that imposed advertising and promotion restrictions on tobacco products, including the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule, which limited brand sponsorships, prohibited certain promotional activities, and restricted the use of non-tobacco trade names. The April 2022 regulatory expansion extended these rules to synthetic nicotine products, significantly narrowing MO's promotional flexibility for nicotine pouches. By 2024, MO had to further adapt its marketing strategies to comply with these restrictions, which included avoiding digital platform promotions due to third-party restrictions and limiting brand visibility in public events and retail environments. These regulatory changes constrained MO\u2019s ability to market to adult consumers and contributed to increased discount brand share (30.4% in Q4 2024), suggesting a shift in promotional tactics toward price competitiveness and in-store visibility.",

For further discussion, see Note 16.\n\n(Income) losses from equity investments, which decreased $5,868 million (100.0%+), were negatively impacted by higher losses from Altria's equity investment in ABI (primarily due to the non-cash impairment of Altria's equity investment in ABI in 2021 discussed above), unfavorable Cronos special items (as discussed above) and a non-cash, unrealized gain resulting from an increase in the estimated fair value of Altria's investment in JUUL in 2020.\n\nReported net earnings (losses) attributable to Altria of $2,475 million decreased $1,992 million (44.6%), due primarily to higher net losses from Altria's equity investments and the loss on early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by the 2020 impairment of JUUL equity securities, higher operating income and favorable net periodic benefit income, excluding service cost. Reported basic and diluted EPS attributable to Altria of $1.34, each decreased by 44.2%,due to lower reported net earnings (losses) attributable to Altria, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding.\n\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to Altria of $8,519 million increased $402 million (5.0%), due primarily to higher smokeable products segment OCI, favorable net periodic benefit income, excluding service cost, higher income from Altria's investment in ABI and lower losses in the all other category (primarily driven by reductions in the estimated residual values of certain assets at PMCC in 2020), partially offset by a higher income tax rate. Adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Altria of $4.61 increased by 5.7%, due to higher adjusted net earnings attributable to Altria and fewer shares outstanding.\n\n## Operating Results by Business Segment\n\n## Tobacco Space\n\n## Business Environment\n\n## Summary\n\nThe U.S. tobacco industry faces a number of business and legal challenges that have adversely affected and may adversely affect the business and sales volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees and Altria's consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position or Altria's ability to achieve its Vision. These challenges, some of which are discussed in more detail in Note 18, Item 1A and Item 3, include:\n\n- pending and threatened litigation and bonding requirements;\n- restrictions and requirements imposed by the FSPTCA, and restrictions and requirements (and related enforcement actions) that have been, and in the future will be, imposed by the FDA;\n- actual and proposed excise tax increases, as well as changes in tax structures and tax stamping requirements;\n- bans and restrictions on tobacco use imposed by governmental entities and private establishments and employers;\n- other federal, state and local government actions, including:\n- restrictions on the sale of certain tobacco products, the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments, the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes;\n- additional restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products;\n- other actual and proposed tobacco-related legislation and regulation; and\n- governmental investigations;\n- reductions in cigarette and MST consumption levels due to growth of innovative tobacco products;\n- increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and other private sector entities (including retail establishments) to further restrict the availability and use of tobacco products;\n- changes in adult tobacco consumer purchase behavior, which is influenced by various factors such as economic conditions (including inflation), excise taxes and price gap relationships, may result in adult tobacco consumers switching to discount products or other lower-priced tobacco products;\n- the highly competitive nature of all tobacco categories, including competitive disadvantages related to cigarette price increases attributable to the settlement of certain litigation and the proliferation of innovative tobacco products, such as e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products;\n- illicit trade in tobacco products;\n- potential adverse changes in prices, availability and quality of tobacco, other raw materials and component parts; and\n- the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition to and in connection with the foregoing, evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences are continuing to impact the tobacco industry.

For the fourth quarter of 2024, the discount share of the cigarette category reached 30.4%, an increase of 0.6 share points sequentially and an increase of 1.7 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe continue to monitor the evolving regulatory, macroeconomic and consumer dynamics within our business environment for impacts on our businesses. Changes in these and other conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## FSPTCA and FDA Regulation\n\n- The Regulatory Framework: The FSPTCA and its related regulations establish broad FDA regulatory authority over all tobacco products and, among other provisions:\n- impose restrictions on the advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products (see Final Tobacco Marketing Rule below);\n- establish pre-market review pathways for new and modified tobacco products (see Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement below);\n- prohibit any express or implied claims that a tobacco product is or may be less harmful than other tobacco products without FDA authorization;\n- authorize the FDA to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health (see Potential Product Standards below); and\n- equip the FDA with a variety of investigatory and enforcement tools, including the authority to inspect product manufacturing and other facilities (see Investigation and Enforcement below).\n\nThe FSPTCA also bans descriptors such as 'light,' 'low' or 'mild' when used as descriptors of modified risk, unless expressly authorized by the FDA.\n\nEffective April 2022, the U.S. Congress expanded the statutory definition of tobacco products to include products containing nicotine derived from any source, including synthetic nicotine. See Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement below for additional information on the effects of the statutory change. Currently, however, the statutory definition of tobacco products does not cover products containing nicotine analogues, which are designed to imitate the effects of nicotine. As a result, products containing nicotine analogues are not subject to the FDA regulatory framework for tobacco products, including the requirements that manufacturers submit a PMTA to, and receive an MGO from, the FDA before marketing such products in the United States.\n\n- Final Tobacco Marketing Rule: As required by the FSPTCA, in March 2010, the FDA promulgated a wide range of advertising and promotion restrictions for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products (the 'Final Tobacco Marketing Rule'). The May 2016 deeming regulations amended the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule to expand specific provisions to all tobacco products, including cigars, pipe tobacco and e-vapor and oral nicotine products containing tobacco-derived nicotine or other tobacco derivatives. (1)\n\nThe Final Tobacco Marketing Rule, as amended, among other things:\n\n- restricts the use of non-tobacco trade and brand names on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products;\n- prohibits sampling of all tobacco products except that sampling of smokeless tobacco products is permitted in qualified adult-only facilities;\n- prohibits the sale or distribution of items such as hats and tee shirts with cigarette or smokeless tobacco brands or logos;\n- prohibits cigarettes and smokeless tobacco brand name sponsorship of any athletic, musical, artistic or other social or cultural event, or any entry or team in any event; and\n- requires the development by the FDA of graphic warnings for cigarettes, establishes warning requirements for other tobacco products and gives the FDA the authority to require new warnings for any type of tobacco product (see FDA Regulatory Actions - Graphic Warnings below).\n\nSubject to certain limitations arising from legal challenges, the Final Tobacco Marketing Rule took effect in June 2010 for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products, in August 2016 for all other tobacco products, including e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products containing tobacco-derived nicotine, and in April 2022 for tobacco products, including e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products, that contain nicotine from any source other than tobacco, such as synthetic nicotine. The Final Tobacco Marketing Rule currently does not apply to products containing nicotine analogues.\n\n- Rulemaking and Guidance: From time to time, the FDA issues proposed regulations and guidance, which may be issued in draft or final form, that generally involve public comment and may include scientific review. The FDA also may request comments on\n\n'Smokeless tobacco,' as used in this section of this Form 10-K, refers to smokeless tobacco products first regulated by the FDA in 2009, including MST. It excludes oral nicotine pouches, which were first regulated by the FDA in 2016. (1)",

Some public health groups have called for, and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed, bans on smoking and vaping in outdoor places, in private apartments and in cars transporting children.\n\n- Other Legislation or Governmental Initiatives: In addition to the actions discussed above, other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions. For ex ample, in recent years, legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards; establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities; restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes; prohibit the sale of tobacco products based on environmental concerns; impose responsibility on manufacturers for the disposal, recycling or other treatment of post-consumer goods such as plastic packaging; require tax stamping of smokeless tobacco products; require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology; and further restrict the sale, marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds, which may or may not be successful. In addition, if a pandemic or similar health emergency occurs, state and local governments may reimpose additional health and safety requirements for all businesses, which could result in the potential temporary closure of certain businesses and facilities. It is possible that tobacco manufacturing and other facilities and the facilities of our suppliers, our suppliers' suppliers and our trade partners could be subject to additional government-mandated temporary closures and restrictions.\n\nIt is not possible to predict what, if any, additional legislation, regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented (and, if challenged, upheld) relating to the manufacturing, design, packaging, marketing, advertising, sale or use of tobacco products, or the tobacco industry generally. Any such legislation, regulation or other governmental action could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n- Governmental Investigations: From time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. For example, we currently are, or recently have been, subject to a number of governmental investigations with respect to our former investment in JUUL, which we divested in March 2023, including the following: (i) the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') issued a Civil Investigative Demand to us while conducting its antitrust review of our former investment in JUUL; (ii) the SEC commenced an investigation relating to our acquisition, disclosures and accounting controls in connection with the JUUL investment; and (iii) the New York State Office of the Attorney General and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General, separately, issued independent subpoenas to us seeking documents relating to our former investment in and provision of services to JUUL. For a discussion of our disposition of our former investment in JUUL, see Note 8.\n\nIn April 2023, January 2024, February 2024 and April 2024, we agreed to settle the lawsuits relating to our former investment in JUUL initiated by the attorneys general of Minnesota, Alaska, Hawaii and New Mexico, respectively.\n\n## Private Sector Activity on Tobacco Products\n\nA number of retailers, including national chains, have discontinued the sale of all tobacco products, and others have discontinued the sale of e-vapor products. Reasons for the discontinuation include change in corporate policy and, with respect to e-vapor products, reported illnesses and the uncertain regulatory environment. Furthermore, third-party digital platforms, such as app stores, have restricted, and in some cases prohibited, communications with adult tobacco consumers concerning tobacco products. It is possible that if this private sector activity becomes more widespread it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products\n\nIllicit trade in tobacco products has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our businesses, including the sales volumes and market shares of our operating companies' innovative and smoke-free products and traditional tobacco products. Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products that do not comply with the FSPTCA and FDA regulations; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untax ed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit disposable e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products may be designed to appeal to youth and are manufactured without scientific standards, exposing consumers to undocumented risks. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment we have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes, imposing",

      "answer": "In 2022, CL was in full compliance with its financial covenants, which were tied to its $3,000 five-year revolving credit facility expiring in 2026, and believed the likelihood of noncompliance was remote. These covenants were linked to cross-default provisions that could trigger acceleration of debt if not met. By 2024, CL had not only maintained compliance but also extended the credit facility twice\u2014first to 2028 and then to 2029\u2014indicating stronger long-term covenant stability. This consistent compliance reduced the risk of triggering cross-default provisions, even as the company refinanced $500 million in medium-term notes and issued $1.5 billion in new senior notes across 3-, 5-, and 10-year maturities. Thus, despite increased debt issuance, the company\u2019s adherence to financial covenants minimized its exposure to cross-default risks over time.",

By 2023, TD continued to underwrite, fund, and own the Target Credit Card receivables, but Target noted a decline in RedCard penetration from 19.8% in 2022 to 18.6% in 2023.

By December 31, 2024, MDLZ had transitioned to using a parametric delta-gamma approximation technique for calculating VAR, replacing the prior variance/co-variance method. Despite the growth in forecasted transactions, the VAR model showed a decrease in estimated maximum potential one-day loss from $284 million (as of September 30, 2023) to $255 million (as of September 28, 2024), attributed to reduced interest rate volatility.

      "question": "How did PEP's allocation of international plan assets to government securities change between 2023 and 2024, and what does this trend indicate about their evolving risk profile in pension fund management?",
      "answer": "In 2023, PEP allocated $1,207 million of international plan assets to government securities, but this amount decreased to $932 million in 2024. This $275 million reduction indicates a strategic shift away from government securities within their international pension fund portfolio. Since government securities are typically considered lower-risk, stable-return investments, this decrease suggests PEP may have been pursuing a more aggressive or diversified investment strategy in 2024 compared to 2023.",

        "Hop 1: PEP(2023) \u2192 International Plan Assets: PEP reported $3,528 million in total international plan assets in 2023, with $1,207 million allocated to government securities.",
        "Hop 2: International Plan Assets \u2192 Government Securities: Government securities represent a specific asset class within the international plan assets portfolio, as detailed in PEP's 2023 filing.",

      "question": "How did the restructuring of MO's debt guarantees through PM USA in 2022 affect the company's strategic focus on cigarette production in 2023, particularly in light of the $22 billion in goodwill and intangible assets tied to cigarettes?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MO relied heavily on PM USA to guarantee its debt obligations, creating a strong financial dependency where PM USA unconditionally guaranteed MO's liabilities, including under its credit agreement and commercial paper program. This dependency was absolute and unconditional, regardless of changes in payment terms or other contractual modifications. In 2023, PM USA remained the primary producer of MO's cigarette products, which accounted for 76.3 billion units shipped in the U.S., despite a 9.9% decline from the prior year. Despite this drop in volume, MO maintained a significant strategic stake in cigarettes, as evidenced by the $22 billion in combined goodwill and intangible assets allocated to the cigarette segment. This suggests that while cigarette shipment volumes declined, the company's long-term strategic commitment to the category remained strong, underpinned by the financial guarantees from PM USA in the prior year that likely stabilized its capital structure and enabled continued investment in the segment.",

        "Hop 1: MO(2022) \u2192 PM USA: MO depended on PM USA to guarantee its debt obligations, including credit agreements and commercial paper programs, with PM USA acting as an unconditional guarantor.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n\nPM USA (the 'Guarantor'), which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

      "question": "How did Altria's pension plan allocation strategy evolve from 2022 to 2023 with respect to Collective Investment Funds, and what role did their valuation methodology play in managing equity volatility?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Altria shifted its pension plan equity/fixed income allocation from 30%/70% to a more conservative 20%/80% to reduce exposure to equity volatility and better align asset values with liabilities. This strategy included investing in Collective Investment Funds (CIFs), which are unregistered investment vehicles pooling assets from multiple fiduciary clients, typically invested in diversified portfolios of stocks, bonds, or other securities. By 2023, CIFs were valued based on the net asset value (NAV) of the underlying assets, a practical expedient used to estimate fair value. This valuation method, combined with the increased fixed income allocation, supported a more stable asset-liability match, thereby helping Altria manage risk and volatility in its pension plan assets.",

The objective of this change is to further reduce the overall exposure to equity volatility and more closely align the values of plan assets with the liabilities. The target allocation between fixed income and growth assets balances pension liability hedging and asset growth in order to maintain the plan's funded status and cover incremental service accruals and interest cost. Liability hedging is achieved through investing in rate-sensitive fixed income securities, primarily corporate bonds and U.S. Treasuries, while growth assets are comprised of publicly traded equity securities.\n\nAltria's investment strategy for its postretirement plan assets is aimed at maximizing the total asset return based on expectation that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the long term and reflects the maturity structure of the benefit obligation. The equity/fixed income target allocation for postretirement plan assets remains unchanged at 55%/45%.\n\nAltria believes that it implements these investment strategies in a prudent and risk-controlled manner, consistent with the fiduciary requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, by investing retirement plan assets in a well-diversified mix of equities, fixed income and other securities.\n\nThe actual composition of Altria's plan assets at December 31, 2021 was broadly characterized with the following allocation:\n\n",

By 2024, the available pool decreased to 26,572,000, while the number of outstanding securities dropped to 15,798,000. This indicates a tightening of available equity compensation, likely due to increased issuance or a strategic decision to reduce future equity dilution. The drop in outstanding options may reflect a shift toward alternative forms of compensation or a more selective grant policy.

      "question": "How did CL's exposure to foreign exchange controls in Argentina in 2024 relate to its Latin American growth strategy from the prior year, particularly in light of the regulatory risk specifically called out in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CL experienced a 16.5% increase in net sales in Latin America, with Argentina being a key contributor to this growth. The region's performance was attributed to volume growth (2.5%), pricing increases (13.0%), and favorable foreign exchange (1.0%). However, the 2023 CRM filing explicitly highlighted that Argentina had amended its foreign exchange controls, which posed a risk to international businesses like CL's due to potential volatility in operating results from FX fluctuations and controls. By 2024, CL disclosed that it had contingent liabilities potentially reaching $250 million, with exposure to foreign exchange controls listed among the key risk factors. This suggests that despite the growth achieved in Latin America in 2023, CL's financial position in 2024 remained vulnerable to Argentina's regulatory environment, particularly its foreign exchange controls, indicating a continuation of the risk rather than its mitigation.",

Commitments and Contingencies\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company has various contractual commitments for future multi-year purchases of raw, packaging and other materials and services totaling approximately $568.\n\nAs a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories, the Company is routinely subject to a wide variety of legal proceedings. These include disputes relating to intellectual property, contracts, product liability, marketing, advertising, foreign ex change controls, antitrust and trade regulation, as well as labor and employment, pension, data privacy and security, environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions. In addition, management proactively reviews and monitors the Company's exposure to, and the impact of, environmental matters. The Company is party to various environmental matters and, as such, may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup, restoration and post-closure monitoring of several sites.\n\nThe Company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances.\n\nThe Company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities, if any, when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates. For those matters disclosed below for which the amount of any potential losses can be reasonably estimated, the Company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is $0 to approx imately $250 (based on current ex change rates). The estimates included in this amount are based on the Company's analysis of currently available information and, as new information is obtained, these estimates may change. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate range may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company. Thus, the Company's exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above.\n\nBased on current knowledge, management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above, an adverse outcome in one or more matters could be material to the Company's results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year.\n\n## Brazilian Matters\n\nThere are certain tax  and civil proceedings outstanding, as described below, related to the Company's 1995 acquisition of the Kolynos oral care business from Wyeth (the 'Seller').\n\nThe Brazilian internal revenue authority has disallowed interest deductions and foreign exchange losses taken by the Company's Brazilian subsidiary for certain years in connection with the financing of the Kolynos acquisition. The tax assessments with interest, penalties and any court-mandated fees, at the current exchange rate, are approximately $93. This amount includes additional assessments received from the Brazilian internal revenue authority in April 2016 relating to net operating loss carryforwards used by the Company's Brazilian subsidiary to offset taxable income that had also been deducted from the authority's original assessments. The Company has been disputing the disallowances by appealing the assessments since October 2001.",

This increase in borrowing capacity indicates a strategic shift toward greater short-term liquidity flexibility. The 2024 agreement also introduced the option to convert outstanding amounts into a term loan, suggesting a more dynamic and adaptable financing approach compared to 2022.

      "answer": "In 2022, KO used a weighted-average risk-free interest rate of 1.2% in its Black-Scholes-Merton model for stock option valuations, while in 2023, this assumption increased to 3.7%. This significant rise in the risk-free rate contributed to a higher weighted-average fair value of stock options granted \u2014 from $12.45 per share in 2022 to $14.89 per share in 2023. The Black-Scholes-Merton model's sensitivity to interest rates, combined with the upward shift in this key assumption, directly influenced the increased valuation of new equity awards in 2023 compared to the prior year.",

          "chunk_text": "Investments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.\n\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. However, the impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.\n\nImpairment charges related to intangible assets, including goodwill, are generally recorded in the line item other operating charges or, to the extent they relate to equity method investees, in the line item equity income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nOur Company is involved in various legal proceedings and tax matters. Due to their nature, such legal proceedings and tax matters involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and/or discloses the relevant circumstances, as appropriate. Refer to Note 11.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nOur Company grants long-term equity awards under its stock-based compensation plans to certain employees of the Company. These awards include stock options, performance share units, restricted stock and restricted stock units. The fair value of stock option grants is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the period the stock option award is earned by the employee, which is generally four years.\n\nThe fair value of restricted stock, restricted stock units and certain performance share units is the closing market price per share of the Company's stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the vesting period. The Company included a relative total shareowner return ('TSR') modifier for most performance share unit awards granted from 2014 through 2017 as well as for performance share unit awards granted to executives from 2018 through 2021. For these awards, the number of performance share units earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company's total shareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of companies fell outside of a predefined range. The fair value of performance share units that include a TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.\n\nIn the reporting period it becomes probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the performance share unit award will be achieved, we recognize compensation expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the performance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the performance share units expected to vest. The remaining fair value of the performance share units expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the remainder of the vesting period. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the award will be achieved, we reverse all of the previously recognized compensation expense in the reporting period such a determination is made.\n\nThe Company has made a policy election to estimate the number of stock-based compensation awards that will ultimately vest to determine the amount of compensation expense recognized each reporting period. Forfeiture estimates are trued-up at the end of the vesting period in order to ensure that compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that ultimately vest. Refer to Note 12.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense includes U.S., state, local and international income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.",

      "question": "How did the evolution of CL's credit facility terms between 2022 and 2024 influence its exposure to cross-default provisions tied to financial covenants?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CL had a $3,000 five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 2026, which was later amended in November 2022 to extend the expiration to November 2027, and further extended to November 2029 by 2024. This evolution of the credit facility terms reduced CL's near-term liquidity risk and thereby lessened the probability of breaching financial covenants, which are linked to cross-default provisions. In 2024, the company remained in compliance with all financial covenants, indicating that the extended facility provided greater operational flexibility and reduced exposure to cross-default risks. This shows a strategic move to stabilize financing conditions and mitigate covenant-related risks over time.",

This continuity in the valuation methodology suggests that the contracts remained within the same fair value hierarchy classification (Level 2), with no shift toward more or less observable pricing inputs.

      "answer": "In 2023, Colgate-Palmolive had 28,522,000 securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans approved by security holders, with 22,916,000 securities tied to outstanding options at a weighted-average exercise price of $75.09.

      "question": "How did Altria's reliance on PM USA's guarantee framework under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to the financial thresholds and insolvency risk metrics outlined in their 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Altria's (MO) subsidiary PM USA was fully and unconditionally guaranteeing the Parent's debt obligations, with explicit disclosures that these guarantees could be voided under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act if PM USA was insolvent or received less than fair consideration at the time of the guarantee. Insolvency was defined based on three metrics: (1) total debts exceeding the fair value of assets, (2) fair saleable value of assets being less than the amount required to pay debts, or (3) inability to pay debts as they mature. The obligations under the guarantees were limited to amounts that would not constitute fraudulent conveyances under applicable laws. By 2024, the same legal framework applied, but the filings emphasized that the Parent\u2019s access to operating cash flows from subsidiaries depended on dividends and intercompany loans, and that neither PM USA nor other subsidiaries faced contractual restrictions on making such distributions. This suggests Altria maintained its guarantee structure but refined its financial risk disclosures to reflect ongoing compliance with the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, particularly around solvency metrics and the absence of restrictive covenants on subsidiary distributions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MO(2022) \u2192 PM USA: Altria relied on PM USA as a 100% owned subsidiary to fully guarantee its debt obligations, with legal disclosures around potential voidance under fraudulent conveyance laws if solvency thresholds were breached.",
        "Hop 2: PM USA \u2192 Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act: The guarantee structure was explicitly subject to the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, which could void the guarantees if PM USA was insolvent or received inadequate value at the time of guaranteeing the debt.",
        "Hop 3: Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act \u2190 MO(2024): In 2024, Altria reaffirmed its guarantee framework under the same legal constraints, but also noted that subsidiaries like PM USA were not contractually restricted from distributing cash via dividends or intercompany loans, indicating a continued but refined approach to solvency risk management."

(the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

      "question": "How did the allocation to Mortgage-Backed Securities within PEP's U.S. Plan Assets change between 2023 and 2024, and what does this shift indicate about the company's investment strategy evolution in managing pension fund risk?",
      "answer": "In 2023, PEP's U.S. Plan Assets included $133 million in Mortgage-Backed Securities, which decreased to $125 million in 2024\u2014a reduction of $8 million. This decline occurred alongside a broader reallocation in the U.S. plan assets, where equity securities decreased from $4,698 million to $4,270 million, government securities fell from $1,812 million to $1,538 million, and corporate bonds dropped from $4,233 million to $3,903 million. Meanwhile, cash and cash equivalents rose significantly from $349 million to $732 million. This pattern suggests a strategic shift toward more liquid and potentially less volatile assets, indicating a more conservative posture in managing pension fund risk in 2024 compared to 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Colgate-Palmolive (CL) was subject to ASU 2022-04, which required enhanced disclosures for supplier finance programs, including roll-forward information. CL adopted the guidance starting January 1, 2023, but delayed the roll-forward requirement until January 1, 2024. By 2024, CL fully complied with ASU 2022-04, including the previously deferred roll-forward disclosures, which indicates a more comprehensive reporting framework for supplier finance obligations. This evolution shows that the company transitioned from partial compliance in 2023 to full disclosure in 2024 under the new accounting standard.",

          "chunk_text": "## (Dollars in Millions Except Per S hare Amounts)\n\nIn August 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-05, 'Business Combinations-Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement.' This ASU requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

      "answer": "The 9.9% decline in cigarette shipments through PM USA in 2023 signaled a weakening core tobacco business, likely prompting MO to place greater strategic emphasis on growth areas like e-vapor and oral nicotine products. However, by 2024, the e-vapor segment faced significant challenges, including regulatory uncertainty and competitive pressures, which put the $1.8 billion carrying value of its e-vapor goodwill at risk of impairment. This suggests that while MO was shifting focus toward next-generation products, the expected returns from these investments had not yet materialized, creating financial pressure and raising questions about the long-term viability of its diversification strategy.",

Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

      "answer": "The extension of the CCAA stay from March 31, 2022, to March 29, 2024, provided continued protection for Philip Morris International and its subsidiary Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH) from Canadian tobacco-related litigation, including the $3.1 billion CAD in compensatory damages allocated to RBH from the Blais case. This delay in litigation proceedings allowed PMI to defer potential financial liabilities and continue deconsolidating RBH\u2019s financial results, which had been excluded from PMI\u2019s consolidated financial statements since March 22, 2019. The extended stay also postponed any enforcement of the security payments related to the appeal process, which RBH had already paid $167 million CAD in installments through March 2017.",

At the present time, except as stated otherwise in this Note 17. Contingencies, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, after assessing the information available to it (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIt is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Nevertheless, although litigation is subject to uncertainty, we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. All such cases are,  and  will  continue  to  be,  vigorously  defended.  However, we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so.\n\n## CCAA Proceedings and Stay of Tobacco-Related Cases Pending in Canada\n\nAs a result of the Court of Appeal of Quebec's decision in both the L\u00e9tourneau and Blais cases described below, our subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH'), and the other defendants, JTI Macdonald Corp., and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited, sought protection in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ('CCAA') on March 22, March 8, and March 12, 2019 respectively. CCAA is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course. The initial CCAA order made by the Ontario Superior Court on March 22, 2019 authorizes RBH to pay all expenses incurred  in  carrying  on  its  business  in  the  ordinary  course  after  the  CCAA  filing,  including  obligations  to  employees,  vendors,  and suppliers.  As  further  described  in  Note  20. Deconsolidation  of  RBH ,  RBH's  financial  results  have  been  deconsolidated  from  our consolidated financial statements since March 22, 2019. As part of the CCAA proceedings, there is currently a comprehensive stay up to and including March 31, 2022 of all tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and the other defendants, including PMI and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), namely, the smoking and health class actions filed in various Canadian provinces and health care cost recovery actions. These proceedings are presented below under the caption ' Stayed Litigation - Canada .'  Ernst &amp; Young Inc. has been appointed as monitor of RBH in the CCAA proceedings. In accordance with the CCAA process, as the parties work towards a plan of arrangement or compromise in a confidential mediation, it is anticipated that the court will set additional hearings and further extend the stay of proceedings. On April 17, 2019, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that RBH and the other defendants will not be allowed to file an application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision in the L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases so long as the comprehensive stay of all tobacco-related litigation in Canada remains in effect and that the time period to file the application would be extended by the stay period. While RBH believes that the findings of liability and damages in both L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases were incorrect, the CCAA proceedings will provide a forum for RBH to seek resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada. It is not possible to predict the resolution of the underlying legal proceedings or the length of the CCAA process.\n\nStayed Litigation - Canada\n\n## Smoking and Health Litigation - Canada\n\nIn the first class action pending in Canada, Conseil Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Sur Le Tabac Et La Sant\u00e9 and Jean-Yves Blais v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. and JTI-Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada ,  filed in November 1998, RBH and other Canadian cigarette manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. and JTI-Macdonald Corp.) are defendants. The plaintiffs, an anti-smoking organization and an individual smoker, sought compensatory and punitive damages for each member of the class who suffers allegedly from certain smoking-related diseases. The class was certified in 2005. The trial court issued its judgment on May 27, 2015. The trial court found RBH and two other Canadian manufacturers liable and found that the class members' compensatory damages totaled approximately CAD 15.5 billion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $12.1 billion). The trial court awarded compensatory damages on a joint and several liability basis, allocating 20% to our subsidiary (approximately CAD 3.1 billion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $2.4  billion)).  In  addition,  the  trial  court  awarded  CAD  90,000  (approximately  $70,500)  in  punitive  damages,  allocating  CAD  30,000 (approximately $23,500) to RBH. The trial court estimated the disease class at 99,957 members. RBH appealed to the Court of Appeal of Quebec. In October 2015, the Court of Appeal ordered RBH to furnish security totaling CAD 226 million (approximately $177 million) to cover both the L\u00e9tourneau and Blais cases, which RBH has paid in installments through March 2017. The Court of Appeal ordered Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. to furnish security totaling CAD 758 million (approximately $594 million) in installments through June 2017. JTI Macdonald Corp. was not required to furnish security in accordance with plaintiffs' motion. The Court of Appeal ordered that the security is payable upon a final judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the trial court's judgment or upon further order of the Court of Appeal.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Mondel\u0113z disclosed forecasted transactions totaling $80 million related to cost of sales and $17 million related to selling, general and administrative expenses, indicating active hedging of these exposures. By 2024, the company explicitly excluded forecasted transactions from its VAR model, which showed a decrease in combined VAR from $284 million in 2023 to $255 million in 2024. This change in modeling approach suggests a strategic shift toward focusing VAR analysis only on existing financial instruments rather than anticipated future transactions, potentially reducing complexity in risk measurement while narrowing the scope of modeled exposures.",

While various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation, the Company's computations are based on a variance/co-variance technique, which assesses the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company's debt, interest rate and foreign exchange, and commodities derivatives, and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level.\n\nThe VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.\n\nVAR on a combined basis decreased to $255 million at September 28, 2024 from $284 million at September 30, 2023 due to reduced interest rate volatility.\n\nThe estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How did the $150 million discretionary contribution to U.S. pension plans in January 2024 and the corresponding shift in asset composition influence the level of dividends and interest receivable by the end of 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, PEP contributed $250 million to its U.S. qualified defined benefit plans and maintained $11,724 million in total U.S. plan assets, including $87 million in dividends and interest receivable. In January 2024, the company made a discretionary contribution of $150 million, bringing total U.S. plan assets to $11,724 million at the start of the year. However, by the end of 2024, total U.S. plan assets decreased to $10,772 million, and dividends and interest receivable turned into a net payable of $358 million, primarily due to securities lending activity. This shift suggests that the discretionary contribution may have been reallocated into more liquid or actively managed investments, such as cash and cash equivalents (which increased from $349 million to $732 million) or equity and fixed-income securities, potentially increasing short-term interest and dividend activity but also leading to a net payable position after accounting for securities lending obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PEP(2023) \u2192 U.S. Plan Assets: PEP disclosed $11,724 million in total U.S. plan assets in 2023, including $87 million in dividends and interest receivable.",
        "Hop 2: U.S. Plan Assets \u2192 Dividends and Interest Receivable: The U.S. plan assets included $87 million in dividends and interest receivable in 2023, and this line item was directly tied to the investment performance and composition of the plan assets.",
        "Hop 3: Dividends and Interest Receivable \u2190 PEP(2024): By 2024, the U.S. plan assets totaled $10,772 million, and the dividends and interest receivable line had transformed into a net payable of $358 million, indicating a shift in asset composition or activity."

By 2024, MDLZ continued to categorize net investment hedge contracts under Level 2 financial assets and maintained a similar valuation methodology, relying on income-based approaches that incorporate observable market data.

      "answer": "MO's continued ownership of USSTC exposed the company to the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (STMSA), which imposed long-standing marketing and advertising restrictions on USSTC\u2019s smokeless tobacco products. In 2022, MO noted that USSTC was the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer under the STMSA, limiting its ability to market flavored products, including mint and wintergreen. As of February 2022, six states and D.C. had enacted flavor bans, with California\u2019s ban delayed pending a referendum. By 2023, the situation intensified: California\u2019s flavor ban became effective in December 2022, and Rhode Island joined the list of states with passed legislation. MO responded by challenging certain laws through litigation while supporting others that aligned with its Vision to transition adult smokers to smoke-free products. The STMSA\u2019s restrictions remained in place throughout both years, constraining MO\u2019s marketing strategies and influencing its dual approach of legal opposition and legislative engagement.",

Segment Reporting .\n\nIn 2020, a majority of Altria's businesses offered cash discounts to customers for prompt payment and calculated cash discounts as a percentage of the list price based on historical experience and agreed-upon payment terms. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021 for USSTC and in the third quarter of 2021 for PM USA, cash discounts were calculated as a flat rate per unit, based on agreed-upon payment terms. Altria's businesses record receivables net of the cash discounts on Altria's consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAltria's businesses that receive payments in advance of product shipment record such payments as deferred revenue. These payments are included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets until control of such products is obtained by the customer. Deferred revenue was $287 million and $301 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. When cash is received in advance of product shipment, Altria's businesses satisfy their performance obligations within three days of receiving payment. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no differences between amounts recorded as deferred revenue and amounts subsequently recognized as revenue.\n\nReceivables were $47 million and $137 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively; the decrease was due primarily to the Ste. Michelle Transaction. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no expected differences between amounts recorded and subsequently received, and Altria's businesses did not record an allowance for doubtful accounts against these receivables.\n\nAltria's businesses record an allowance for returned goods, which is included in other accrued liabilities on Altria's consolidated balance sheets. While all of Altria's tobacco operating companies sell tobacco products with dates relative to freshness as printed on product packaging, it is USSTC's policy to accept authorized sales returns from its customers for products that have passed such dates due to the limited shelf life of USSTC's MST and snus products. Altria's businesses record estimated sales returns, which are based principally on historical volume and return rates, as a reduction to revenues. Actual sales returns will differ from estimated sales returns to the extent actual results differ from estimated assumptions. Altria's businesses reflect differences between actual and estimated sales returns in the period in which the actual amounts become known. These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements. All returned goods are destroyed upon return and not included in inventory. Consequently, Altria's businesses do not record an asset for their right to recover goods from customers upon return.\n\nSales incentives include variable payments related to goods sold by Altria's businesses. Altria's businesses include estimates of variable consideration as a reduction to revenues upon shipment of goods to customers. The sales incentives that require significant estimates and judgments are as follows:\n\n- Price promotion paymentsAltria's businesses make price promotion payments, substantially all of which are made to their retail partners to incent the promotion of certain product offerings in select geographic areas.\n- Wholesale and retail participation paymentsAltria's businesses make payments to their wholesale and retail partners to incent merchandising and sharing of sales data in accordance with each business's trade agreements.\n\nThese estimates primarily include estimated wholesale to retail sales volume and historical acceptance rates. Actual payments will differ from estimated payments to the extent actual results differ from estimated assumptions. Differences between actual and estimated payments are reflected in the period such information becomes available. These differences, if any, have not had a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements.",

These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2021, the inflation calculation was approximately 7% based on the latest CPI-U data; however, the increase in the annual payments did not have a material impact on Altria's financial position. Altria believes that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022, but does not expect the corresponding increase in annual payments to result in a material financial impact. However, we will continue to monitor conditions related to the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment.\n\nFor a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below and Note 18. The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers' business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). The State Settlement Agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters. In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; limit the industry's ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.\n\nIn November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the 'STMSA') with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC. The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions. USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.\n\n## Other International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity\n\n- International, Federal, State and Local Regulation: Various states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches), such as legislation that (i) prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories, such as e-vapor, (ii) prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors, such as menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, (iii) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings and (iv) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products. The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products. As of February 22, 2022, multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products, and six states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Utah, New York and Illinois) and the District of Columbia have passed such legislation. Some of these states, such as New York, Utah and Illinois, exempt certain products that have received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway.\n\nThe legislation in California bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors, including menthol, mint and wintergreen. Following enactment of the flavor ban in August 2020, several registered California voters filed a referendum against the legislation. In January 2021 the requisite number of registered California voters signed a petition to place the question of whether the legislation should be affirmed or overturned on the next statewide general election ballot, which will likely take place in November 2022, unless a special statewide election is called earlier. As a result, the implementation of the legislation is delayed until after a vote on the referendum occurs.\n\nMassachusetts passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in e-vapor products. Similar legislation is pending in one other state.\n\nRestrictions on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products also have been instituted or proposed internationally.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal, state and local legislation and other governmental action, including through litigation. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL. Such action also could negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.",

This represents a $3 million (11.1%) increase in this specific asset category. The growth suggests a strategic decision to expand exposure to insurance-related instruments within their international plan assets, despite an overall decline in total international plan assets from $3,195 million in 2022 to $3,528 million in 2023. This selective increase indicates a targeted shift in investment focus toward insurance contracts despite broader portfolio adjustments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Helix had submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020, but as of February 22, 2022, the FDA had not issued marketing order decisions, leaving the product in regulatory limbo. This uncertainty contributed to MO's broader regulatory risk exposure, as the company disclosed that unfavorable FDA determinations could materially impact business results. By 2024, Helix had expanded its regulatory engagement by submitting PMTAs for on! PLUS in June 2024, indicating a strategic shift toward product diversification and flavor expansion within the oral nicotine pouch category. However, as of February 24, 2025, the FDA still had not issued marketing orders for any on! or on! PLUS products, suggesting continued regulatory risk. This evolution shows that while MO increased its regulatory engagement through additional PMTAs, the lack of FDA decisions maintained a high level of regulatory uncertainty, influencing MO's product strategy and risk exposure in the oral nicotine pouch market.",

          "chunk_text": "\nNote: The oral tobacco products segment retail share results exclude international volume, which is currently not material. Retail share results for oral tobacco products are based on data from IRI InfoScan, a tracking service that uses a sample of stores to project market share and depict share trends. This service tracks sales in the food, drug, mass merchandisers, convenience, military, dollar store and club trade classes on the number of cans and packs sold. Oral tobacco products is defined by IRI as MST, snus and oral nicotine pouches. New types of oral tobacco products, as well as new packaging configurations of existing oral tobacco products, may or may not be equivalent to existing MST products on a can-for-can basis. For example, one pack of snus or one can of oral nicotine pouches, irrespective of the number of pouches in the pack or can, is assumed to be equivalent to one can of MST. Because this service represents retail share performance only in key trade channels, it should not be considered a precise measurement of actual retail share. It is IRI's standard practice to periodically refresh its InfoScan services, which could restate retail share results that were previously released in this service.\n\nFor a discussion of volume trends and factors that impact volume and retail share performance, see Tobacco Space - Business Environment above.\n\n## 2021 Compared with 2020\n\nThe oral tobacco products segment's reported domestic shipment volume was essentially unchanged as the industry's growth rate and trade inventory movements were essentially offset by retail share losses and calendar differences. When adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences, the oral tobacco products segment's reported domestic shipment volume decreased by an estimated 0.5%.\n\nTotal oral tobacco products category industry volume increased by an estimated 2% over the six months ended December 31, 2021, driven by growth in oral nicotine pouches.\n\nRetail share losses in the oral tobacco products segment, including Copenhage n, were due to the growth of oral nicotine pouches.\n\nTotal U.S. oral tobacco category share for on! nicotine pouches grew to 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 2.8 percentage points versus the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nIn 2021, Helix achieved unconstrained on! manufacturing capacity for the current estimated size of the U.S. oral nicotine pouch category.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, on! was available for sale in approximately 117,000 U.S. stores.",

Through these processes, a manufacturer could receive (i) a 'not substantially equivalent' determination, (ii) a denial of a PMTA or (iii) a marketing order withdrawal by the FDA on one or more products, which would require the removal of the product or products from the market. Such actions could have a material adverse impact on the business and consolidated results of operations of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\nProvisional Products : Most cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by PM USA and USSTC are 'Provisional Products.' Altria's subsidiaries timely submitted SE reports for these Provisional Products. PM USA and USSTC have received SE determinations on certain Provisional Products. Those products that were found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent (certain smokeless tobacco products) had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA's determinations; therefore, those determinations did not impact business results. PM USA and USSTC have other Provisional Products that continue to be subject to the FDA's pre-market review process. In the meantime, they can continue marketing these products unless the FDA determines that a specific Provisional Product is not substantially equivalent.\n\nIn addition, the FDA has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of Provisional Product SE reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further FDA review. PM USA and USSTC have Provisional Products included in this subset of products.\n\nWhile Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies believe their current Provisional Products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, they cannot predict how the FDA will ultimately apply law, regulation and guidance to their various SE reports. Should Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies receive unfavorable determinations on any SE reports currently pending with the FDA, they believe they can replace the vast majority of their respective product volumes with other FDA authorized products or with Grandfathered Products.\n\nNon-Provisional Products : Cigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after March 22, 2011 are 'Non-Provisional Products' and must receive a marketing order from the FDA prior to being offered for sale. Marketing orders for Non-Provisional Products may be obtained by filing an SE report, PMTA or using another pre-market pathway established by the FDA. Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies may not be able to obtain a marketing order for non-provisional products because the FDA may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval.\n\nProducts Regulated in 2016 : Manufacturers of products first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an SE report or PMTA by the filing deadline of September 9, 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market. These products can remain on the market during FDA review through court-allowed, case-by-case discretion, so long as the report or application was timely filed with the FDA. Due to the large number of applications received by September 9, 2020, the FDA did not complete its review of all submitted applications by September 9, 2021, although it represents that it has made decisions on more than 98% of the applications, with most being marketing denial orders and a few marketing granted orders for tobacco flavor e-vapor products. A number of the marketing denial orders are subject to litigation challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers. For those products still under FDA review, it is uncertain when and for how long the FDA may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its case-by-case discretion. For products (new or modified) not on the market as of August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file an SE report or PMTA and receive FDA authorization prior to marketing and selling the product.\n\nHelix submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020. JUUL submitted PMTAs to the FDA for its e-vapor device and the related tobacco and menthol flavors in July 2020. As of February 22, 2022, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or JUUL products. In addition, as of February 22, 2022, Middleton has received market orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn December 2013, Altria's subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with PMI, including an agreement that grants Altria an exclusive right to commercialize certain of PMI's heated tobacco products in the United States, subject to FDA authorization of the applicable products. PMI submitted a PMTA and a MRTP application with the FDA for its electronically heated tobacco products comprising the IQOS Tobacco Heating System . The IQOS devices heat, but do not burn tobacco. In April 2019, the FDA authorized the PMTA for the IQOS Tobacco Heating System and in July 2020, the FDA authorized the marketing of this system as a MRTP with a reduced exposure claim. In December 2020, the FDA authorized the PMTA for IQOS 3, an updated version of the IQOS devices. The MRTP authorization for the original IQOS device currently does not apply to the IQOS 3 device. PMI submitted an MRTP application for the IQOS 3 device in March 2021, which is currently under review by the FDA.\n\nIn September 2021, in connection with a patent dispute, the ITC issued a cease and desist order, effective as of November 29, 2021, banning (i) the importation of the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and infringing components into the United States and (ii) the sale, marketing and distribution of such imported products in the United States.

PLUS oral nicotine pouches in tobacco, mint and wintergreen flavors in June 2024. As of February 24, 2025, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or on! PLUS products.\n\nAs of February 24, 2025, Middleton has received marketing orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn October 2021, the FDA authorized the marketing and sale of four of USSTC's Verve oral nicotine products, including Green Mint and Blue Mint varieties, representing the first flavored product authorizations issued by the FDA for newly deemed innovative products. These products are not currently marketed or sold.\n\nIn March 2023, the FDA authorized USSTC to communicate a modified risk claim about its Copenhagen Classic Snuff MST product. This product is not currently marketed or sold. The authorized claim for Copenhagen Classic Snuff is 'IF YOU SMOKE, CONSIDER THIS: Switching completely to this product from cigarettes reduces risk of lung cancer.' In February 2025, USSTC filed a notice with the FDA withdrawing its modified risk application.\n\nAs a result of our June 2023 acquisition of NJOY Holdings, we gained full global ownership of NJOY's e-vapor product portfolio, including NJOY ACE , a pod-based e-vapor product with an MGO from the FDA, and NJOY DAILY , which also has an MGO. In June 2024, NJOY received MGOs with respect to two NJOY ACE menthol products and two NJOY DAILY menthol products. In May 2024, NJOY submitted a supplemental PMTA to the FDA to commercialize and market the NJOY ACE 2.0 device, which leverages Bluetooth connectivity to incorporate access restriction technology designed to prevent underage use by authenticating the user before unlocking the device. Also in May 2024, NJOY re-submitted PMTAs for blueberry and watermelon flavored pod-based e-vapor products that work exclusively with the Bluetooth -enabled NJOY ACE 2.0 device. These products previously received marketing denial orders ('MDOs') on the basis of FDA concerns regarding underage use. \u00ae \u00ae\n\nPost-Market Surveillance : Manufacturers that receive MGOs must adhere to the FDA post-market record keeping and reporting requirements, as detailed in market orders and in the final PMTA rule. The requirements include prior notification of marketing activities. The FDA may amend requirements of an MGO or withdraw the MGO based on this information if, among other reasons, it determines that the continued marketing of the products is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health.",

By 2024, the fair value of these contracts had decreased to -$219 million as of December 31, 2023 (reported in the 2024 filing), suggesting a significant liability position.

      "answer": "In 2022, PEP's U.S. Plan Assets included $533 million in Real Estate Commingled Funds, which decreased to $411 million in 2023. These funds, which are invested in limited partnerships, continued to be valued based on net asset value derived from appraised values determined by independent third parties using unobservable inputs. However, the liquidity terms remained largely unchanged, with most funds redeemable quarterly subject to cash availability and notice periods ranging from 45 to 90 days. This reduction in allocation suggests a strategic shift in investment focus or a response to market conditions affecting real estate assets.",

      "question": "How did PepsiCo's acquisition of full ownership in Sabra Dipping Company in December 2024 impact the strategic positioning of the Sabra brand, considering its initial joint venture structure in 2022?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Sabra was a joint venture in which PepsiCo had a 50% ownership stake, limiting its control over strategic decisions and operational direction. By December 2024, PepsiCo acquired the remaining 50% from Strauss Group, making Sabra a wholly-owned subsidiary. This acquisition allowed PepsiCo to fully integrate Sabra\u2019s refrigerated dips and spreads into its broader Frito-Lay North America portfolio, enhancing brand control, streamlining distribution, and aligning Sabra\u2019s growth strategy directly with PepsiCo\u2019s long-term objectives in the convenient foods segment.",

By 2023, this number had decreased to 28,522,000, showing a reduction of 8,506,000 available securities. This decline suggests that CL utilized a significant portion of its approved equity compensation pool during this period, potentially reflecting increased issuance of equity-based compensation to employees or executives. The change implies a more active use of equity incentives in 2022\u20132023, which may have been part of a broader strategy to align employee interests with long-term shareholder value, as these plans are typically stakeholder-approved mechanisms designed to enhance retention and performance alignment.",

The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the above-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.\n\nThe VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A parametric delta-gamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year.

While various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation, the Company's computations are based on a variance/co-variance technique, which assesses the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company's debt, interest rate and foreign exchange, and commodities derivatives, and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level.\n\nThe VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.\n\nVAR on a combined basis decreased to $255 million at September 28, 2024 from $284 million at September 30, 2023 due to reduced interest rate volatility.\n\nThe estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):\n\n",

By 2024, these commodity futures were specifically categorized under Level 1 Financial Assets, which are defined as exchange-traded futures and listed options valued at quoted market prices. This shift indicates a more formalized classification and valuation framework, where the company's exposure to commodity futures became more transparently tied to observable market pricing on exchanges, as opposed to internal models or over-the-counter valuations.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe use a combination of primarily currency forward contracts, futures, options and swaps; commodity forward contracts, futures and options; and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our asset derivatives is recorded within other current assets and other assets and the fair value of our liability derivatives is recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Non-cash changes in unrealized gains and losses related to our unsettled derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items, net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated, and those that are economic hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Currency movements related to our non-U.S. debt and our net investments in non-U.S. operations, as well as the related deferred taxes, are recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.\n\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.\n\nCommodity derivatives . We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nCurrency exchange derivatives . We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. Any unrealized gains or losses (mark-to-market impacts)",

      "answer": "In 2022, a weaker U.S. dollar positively impacted KO's Europe, Middle East and Africa segment, primarily driven by the British pound sterling, euro, and Chinese yuan. This led to a 1% increase in consolidated net operating revenues. By 2024, the situation reversed: a stronger U.S. dollar, particularly against the Argentine peso, Turkish lira, and Japanese yen, created a 5% overall decline in consolidated net operating revenues, though partially offset by continued strength in the British pound and euro. The net operating income for the Europe, Middle East and Africa segment in 2022 was positively impacted by $7 million due to revisions related to strategic realignment initiatives, indicating a nuanced interplay between macroeconomic conditions and internal strategic adjustments.",

By December 2024, PepsiCo acquired the remaining 50% ownership stake from Strauss Group, making Sabra a wholly-owned subsidiary. This acquisition allowed PepsiCo to fully control the production, marketing, and distribution of Sabra refrigerated dips and spreads, likely enhancing integration with FLNA\u2019s branded convenient foods portfolio and enabling more direct strategic alignment.

      "question": "How did the evolution of Target's credit card profit-sharing arrangement with TD between 2022 and 2023 reflect changes in the company's loyalty program revenue and its strategic partnership dynamics?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Target received payments under a credit card program agreement with TD, where Target earned a percentage of profits from Target Credit Card and MasterCard receivables, while TD underwrote, funded, and owned the receivables. During this time, Target's loyalty program (Target Circle) had $89 million in deferred revenue. By 2023, the loyalty program had grown, with deferred revenue increasing to $112 million, indicating stronger customer engagement. This likely contributed to higher transaction volumes on the Target Credit Card, which in turn would have increased the profit-sharing payments from TD. The partnership remained stable, with TD continuing to underwrite and manage risk, but the growth in loyalty program revenue suggests a deepening strategic relationship between Target and TD through increased consumer engagement and co-branded card usage.",

        "Hop 3: TD \u2190 TGT(2023): TD continues to underwrite Target Credit Card, but Target Circle deferred revenue increased to $112 million, suggesting stronger card usage and profit-sharing potential"

Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any additional outside basis differences in these entities is not practicable.\n\nThe Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ('GILTI') provisions of the Tax Reform Act require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return each foreign subsidiary's earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary's tangible assets. An accounting policy election is available to either account for the tax effects of GILTI in the period that is subject to such taxes or to provide deferred taxes for book and tax basis differences that upon reversal may be subject to such taxes. We have elected to account for the tax effects of these provisions in the period that is subject to such tax and the impact is reflected in our full year provision.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in all applicable jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal jurisdiction, U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions. U.S. tax authorities have completed their federal income tax examinations for all years prior to 2007. With respect to U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions, with limited exceptions, the Company and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to 2006. For U.S. federal and state tax purposes, the net operating losses and tax credit carryovers acquired in connection with our acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.'s former North America business that were generated from the years of 1990 through 2010 are subject to adjustments until the year in which they are actually utilized is no longer subject to examination. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company believes that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been provided for in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance.",

      "answer": "In 2023, MDLZ's VAR model used a parametric deltagamma approximation technique to estimate expected return distributions for interest rates, currencies, and commodities, based on prior quarter observations. By 2024, the VAR model showed a decrease in combined VAR from $284 million to $255 million, attributed to reduced interest rate volatility. This change in the VAR model's output coincided with a significant increase in the reported value of forecasted transactions from $2 million (2023) to $106 million (2024), particularly in interest payments and cost of sales, indicating a strategic shift toward more hedging of forecasted commodity and interest-related exposures.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PM identified significant risks from the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including disruptions in supply chains and regulatory delays, which could negatively affect the commercialization of their Reduced Risk Products (RRPs). These disruptions were compounded by the broader regulatory environment shaped by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which was actively promoting increasingly restrictive regulatory measures globally. By 2023, PM noted that the FCTC was not only driving regulatory initiatives that could reduce demand for tobacco products but also explicitly encouraging litigation against tobacco manufacturers. This evolution indicates that PM's earlier exposure to regulatory constraints under the FCTC (2022) transitioned into a more direct risk of legal challenges in 2023, with damages in some cases ranging into the billions of U.S. dollars, particularly in Brazil, Canada, and Nigeria.",

          "chunk_text": "## Risks Related to the Impact of COVID-19 on our Business\n\n## Our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position may be adversely impacted during the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created significant societal and economic disruption, and resulted in closures of stores, factories and offices, and restrictions on manufacturing, distribution and travel, all of which have and will continue to adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Our business continuity plans and other safeguards may not be effective to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.\n\nAn adequate supply chain for our RRP portfolio, including the supply of electronic devices, is important to our business. We work with four electronics manufacturing service providers for the supply of our Platform 1 and Platform 4 devices, and a small number of other providers for other products in our RRP portfolio and related accessories. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the operations of our two main electronic manufacturing service providers were temporarily suspended at different times. Even though these suspensions did not materially affect our operations, if one or more of these service providers were significantly constrained at the same time, the supply of the devices could be disrupted. Although we work closely with these service providers on monitoring their production capability and financial health, we cannot guarantee that they will remain capable of meeting their commitments, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; if they will not, the commercialization of our RRPs could be adversely affected. The production of our RRP portfolio requires various metals, and we believe that  there  is  an  adequate  supply  of  such  metals  in  the  world  markets  to  satisfy  our  current  and  anticipated  production  requirements. However, some components and materials necessary for the production of our RRPs, including those for the electronic devices, are obtained from  single  or  limited  sources,  and  can  be  subject  to  industry-wide  shortages  and  price  fluctuations.  While  we  were  successful  in maintaining adequate supply of such components and materials so far, we may not be able to secure such supply going forward, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; this could negatively impact the commercialization of our RRPs.\n\nSignificant risks to our business during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic also include our diminished ability to convert adult smokers to our RRPs, significant volume declines in our duty-free business and certain other key markets, disruptions or delays in our manufacturing and supply chain, including delays and increased costs in the shipment of parts to manufacture our products or for the products themselves, increased  currency  volatility,  and  delays  in  certain  cost  saving,  transformation  and  restructuring  initiatives.  Our  business  could  also  be adversely impacted if key personnel or a significant number of employees or business partners become unavailable due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The significant adverse impact of COVID-19 on the economic or political conditions in markets in which we operate could result in changes to the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for our mid-price or premium-price brands.\n\nContinuation of the pandemic could disrupt our access to the credit markets or increase our borrowing costs. Governments may temporarily be unable to focus on the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business. In addition, messaging about the potential negative impacts of the use of our products on COVID-19 risks may lead to increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the sale and use of our products, negatively impact demand for our products and the willingness of adult consumers to switch to our RRPs, and adversely impact our efforts to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs. All of the aforementioned impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, results of operations, revenues, cash flow and profitability.\n\nThe impact of these risks also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in general and specifically in the jurisdictions in which we operate, its recurrence in our key markets, actions taken to contain its spread and to mitigate its public health effects, and the ultimate economic consequences thereof.\n\n## Risks Related to Illicit Trade\n\n## We lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband, cross-border purchases, \"illicit whites,\" non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers, and counterfeiting of our Platform 1 device and heated tobacco units.\n\nLarge quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market. We believe that Marlboro is  the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity. In addition, our revenues are reduced  by  contraband,  legal  cross-border  purchases,  \"illicit  whites\"  and  non-tax-paid  volume  produced  by  local  manufacturers.  Our revenues and consumer satisfaction with our Platform 1 device and heated tobacco units may be adversely affected by counterfeit products that do not meet our product quality standards and scientific validation procedures.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ's chocolate segment in the AMEA region contributed $2,082 million in revenue, accounting for 8.3% of the company's global chocolate revenue. This strong regional contribution positioned AMEA as a significant market for chocolate. By 2024, despite a net pricing increase of 7.8 percentage points driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, the chocolate segment faced unfavorable volume/mix impacts, with volume declines contributing to a drag on growth. This marks a shift from 2023, where chocolate had contributed to favorable volume/mix gains. The evolution shows that while chocolate remained a key product category, its performance in AMEA weakened in 2024, reflecting broader challenges in maintaining volume growth despite pricing power.",

Higher  net  pricing,  driv en  by  input  cost-driv en  pricing  actions,  was reflected across all categories except cheese &amp; grocery. Ov erall, unfav orable v olume/mix reflected v olume declines due to the impact from customer price negotiation disruptions primarily in the second quarter, partially offset by fav orable product mix. Unfav orable v olume/mix was driv en by declines in chocolate, biscuits &amp; baked snacks, refreshment bev erages, candy and gum, partially offset by a gain in cheese &amp; grocery. The impact of our 2023 div estiture of the dev eloped market gum business resulted in a year-ov er-year reduction in net rev enues of $174 million. Unfav orable currency translation rate changes reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar relativ e to most currencies across the region, including the Turkish lira, Russian ruble and Ukrainian hryv nya, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relativ e to the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, Polish zloty and euro.\n\nSegment  operating  income  increased  $90  million  (4.6%),  primarily  due  to  higher  net  pricing,  lower  div estiture-related  costs,  lower  impact  from  the European Commission legal matter, lower costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, lower manufacturing costs driv en by productiv ity and lower remeasurement  loss  on  net  monetary  position.  These  fav orable  items  were  partially  offset  by  higher  raw  material  costs,  higher  intangible  asset impairment charges, higher adv ertising and consumer promotion costs, lapping prior-year operating results from the dev eloped market gum business div ested in 2023, unfav orable v olume/mix, unfav orable currency translation rate changes, higher other selling, general and administrativ e expenses, costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program and higher fixed asset impairment costs.\n\n## 2023 compared with 2022\n\nNet  rev enues  increased  $1,437  million  (12.6%),  due  to  higher  net  pricing  (13.8  pp),  fav orable  v olume/mix  (0.7  pp)  and  the  impact  from  short-term distributor agreements (0.2 pp), partially offset by unfav orable currency (1.9 pp) and the impact of div estitures (0.2 pp). Higher net pricing, driv en by input cost-driv en pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. Ov erall, v olume/mix was fav orable driv en by improv ed product mix. Fav orable v olume/mix was driv en by gains in biscuits &amp; baked snacks, chocolate, gum and refreshment bev erages, partially offset by declines in cheese &amp; grocery and candy. The short-term distributor agreement related to the October 1, 2023 sale of our dev eloped market gum business added incremental net rev enues of $22 million.  Unfav orable  currency  impacts  reflected  the  strength  of  the  U.S.  dollar  relativ e  to  sev eral  currencies  across  the  region,  including  the  Russian ruble, T urkish lira, Norwegian krone, Ukrainian hryv nya and Swedish krona, partially offset by the strength of sev eral currencies relativ e to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Polish zloty, British pound sterling and Swiss franc. T he impact of div estitures reflected a year-ov er-year decline in net rev enues of $4 million from our 2023 div ested dev eloped market gum business.\n\nSegment operating income increased $497 million (33.6%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower impact from the European Commission legal matter, lapping the prior year incremental costs incurred due to the war in Ukraine, lower acquisition integration costs and fav orable v olume/mix.

      "answer": "In 2023, MO's commercial paper program was guaranteed by PM USA, which also guaranteed MO's outstanding debt securities and borrowings under its credit agreement. During 2023, MO issued $1.0 billion in senior unsecured notes and repaid $1.3 billion in Euro-denominated notes and $218 million in senior unsecured notes. In 2024, PM USA continued to guarantee MO's obligations, including those under the commercial paper program, but MO also disclosed a $125 million hypothetical impairment charge related to its e-vapor reporting unit, indicating increased financial risk exposure. The continued guarantee by PM USA provided stability in MO's debt structure, but the potential impairment charge in 2024 signaled a shift in financial performance that could affect future obligations.",

        "Hop 1: MO(2023) \u2192 MO Commercial Paper Program: MO had guarantees in place for its commercial paper program, with PM USA guaranteeing obligations under the program.",
        "Hop 2: MO Commercial Paper Program \u2192 PM USA: PM USA guaranteed MO\u2019s commercial paper obligations, debt securities, and credit agreement borrowings, reinforcing its role as a financial backstop.",

of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2023. From time to time, we also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. As further discussed in Note 19, as part of the supplier financing program, Altria guarantees the financial obligations of ALCS under the financing program agreement. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 10, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Long-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Purchase Obligations - We have entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

      "question": "How did the enactment of Thailand's New Customs Act in 2017 impact the maximum potential fines faced by Philip Morris Thailand in customs duty underpayment cases from 2022 to 2023, and how did this affect the company's final payments in these cases?",
      "answer": "The enactment of Thailand's New Customs Act in 2017 significantly limited the maximum fines that could be imposed in customs duty underpayment cases. In 2022, Philip Morris Thailand faced a potential fine of THB 80.8 billion (approximately $2.4 billion) for imports from the Philippines (2003\u20132006), but due to the new law, the actual fine imposed was THB 1.2 billion (approximately $36 million). In 2023, for a separate case involving imports from Indonesia (2000\u20132003), the government initially sought THB 19.8 billion (approximately $553 million), but the fine was ultimately reduced to THB 130 million (approximately $3.6 million) after trial and further reduced on appeal. The New Customs Act therefore had a material effect in reducing the financial exposure and final payments made by PM Thailand in both years.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PM(2022) \u2192 New Customs Act: The 2022 case involving imports from the Philippines was affected by the 2017 customs law, which capped potential fines. Originally facing THB 80.8 billion (~$2.4B), the fine was reduced to THB 1.2 billion (~$36M).",
        "Hop 2: New Customs Act \u2192 Thailand: Thailand enacted the New Customs Act in May 2017, which limited the maximum fines that could be imposed in customs underpayment cases, directly affecting how much the government could seek from Philip Morris Thailand.",
        "Hop 3: Thailand \u2190 PM(2023): In 2023, the customs law again limited the fine in the Indonesia import case, where the government initially sought THB 19.8 billion (~$553M), but the final fine was THB 130 million (~$3.6M), later reduced further on appeal."

          "chunk_text": "As of December 31, 2021, there were 3 label-related cases brought by individual plaintiffs in Italy (1) and Chile (2) pending against our subsidiaries, compared with 5 such cases on December 31, 2020, and 5 such cases on December 31, 2019.\n\nPublic Civil Actions: Claims have been filed either by an individual, or a public or private entity, seeking to protect collective or individual rights, such as the right to health, the right to information or the right to safety. Plaintiffs' allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including product defect, concealment, and misrepresentation. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief including injunctive relief such as banning cigarettes, descriptors, smoking in certain places and advertising, as well as implementing communication campaigns and reimbursement of medical expenses incurred by public or private institutions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, there was 1 public civil action pending against our subsidiary in Venezuela (1), compared with 2 such cases on December 31, 2020, and 2 such cases on December 31, 2019.\n\nIn  a  public  civil  action  in  Venezuela, Federation  of  Consumers  and  Users  Associations  ('FEVACU'),  et  al.  v.  National  Assembly  of Venezuela and the Venezuelan Ministry of Health, Constitutional Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court , filed April 29, 2008, we were not named as a defendant, but the plaintiffs published a notice pursuant to court order, notifying all interested parties to appear in the case. In January 2009, our subsidiary appeared in the case in response to this notice. The plaintiffs purport to represent the right to health of the citizens of Venezuela and claim that the government failed to protect adequately its citizens' right to health. The claim asks the court to order the government to enact stricter regulations on the manufacture and sale of tobacco products. In addition, the plaintiffs ask the court to order companies involved in the tobacco industry to allocate a percentage of their 'sales or benefits' to establish a fund to pay for the health care costs of treating smoking-related diseases. In October 2008, the court ruled that plaintiffs have standing to file the claim and that the claim  meets  the  threshold  admissibility  requirements.  In  December  2012,  the  court  admitted  our  subsidiary  and  BAT's  subsidiary  as interested third parties. In February 2013, our subsidiary answered the complaint.\n\n## Reduced-Risk Products\n\nIn  Colombia,  an  individual  filed  a  purported  class  action, Ana Ferrero Rebolledo v. Philip Morris Colombia S.A., et al. ,  in April  2019 against  our  subsidiaries  with  the  Civil  Court  of  Bogota  related  to  the  marketing  of  our  Platform  1  product.  Plaintiff  alleged  that  our subsidiaries advertise the product in contravention of law and in a manner that misleads consumers by portraying the product in a positive light, and further asserts that the Platform 1 vapor contains many toxic compounds, creates a high level of dependence, and has damaging second-hand effects. Plaintiff sought injunctive relief and damages on her behalf and on a behalf of two classes (class 1 - all Platform 1 consumers in Colombia who seek damages for the purchase price of the product and personal injuries related to the alleged addiction, and class 2 - all residents of the neighborhood where the advertising allegedly took place who seek damages for exposure to the alleged illegal advertising). Our subsidiaries answered the complaint in January 2020, and in February 2020, plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint modifies the relief sought on behalf of the named plaintiff and on behalf of a single class (all consumers of Platform 1 products in Colombia who seek damages for the product purchase price and personal injuries related to the use of an allegedly harmful product). In June 2021, our subsidiaries answered the amended complaint.\n\n## Other Litigation\n\nThe Department of Special Investigations of the government of Thailand (\"DSI\") conducted an investigation into alleged underpayment by our  subsidiary,  Philip  Morris  (Thailand)  Limited  (\"PM  Thailand\"),  of  customs  duties  and  excise  taxes  relating  to  imports  from  the Philippines  covering  the  period  2003-2007.  On  January  18,  2016,  the  Public  Prosecutor  filed  charges  against  our  subsidiary  and  seven former and current employees in the Bangkok Criminal Court alleging that PM Thailand and the individual defendants jointly and with the intention to defraud the Thai government, under-declared import prices of cigarettes to avoid full payment of taxes and duties in connection with import entries of cigarettes from the Philippines during the period of July 2003 to June 2006. The government is seeking a fine of approximately THB 80.8 billion (approximately $2.4 billion). In May 2017, Thailand enacted a new customs act. The new act, which took effect in November 2017, substantially limits the amount of fines that Thailand could seek in these proceedings. PM Thailand believes that its declared import prices are in compliance with the Customs Valuation Agreement of the World Trade Organization and Thai law and that the allegations of the Public Prosecutor are inconsistent with several decisions already taken by Thai Customs and other Thai governmental agencies.  Trial  in  the  case  began  in  November  2017  and  concluded  in  September  2019.  In  November  2019,  the  trial  court  found  our subsidiary guilty of under-declaration of the prices and imposed a fine of approximately THB 1.2 billion (approximately $36 million). The trial court dismissed all charges against the individual defendants. In December 2019, as required by the Thai law, our subsidiary paid the fine. This payment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the period of payment. Our subsidiary filed an appeal of the trial court's decision. In addition, the Public Prosecutor filed an appeal of the trial court's decision challenging the dismissal of charges against the individual defendants and the amount of the fine imposed. If our subsidiary ultimately prevails on appeal, then Thailand will be required to return this payment to our subsidiary. The appellate court is scheduled to issue its decision on the appeals on June 1, 2022.",

      "question": "How did the enactment of Thailand's New Customs Act in 2017 impact Philip Morris's customs-related financial exposure in Thailand between 2022 and 2024, particularly in light of the reduced fine amounts imposed under the new regulatory framework?",
      "answer": "The enactment of Thailand's New Customs Act in 2017 significantly reduced Philip Morris's customs-related financial exposure in Thailand. In 2022, the appellate court decision in the 2003\u20132006 import case limited the fine to THB 1.2 billion (approximately $36 million), a substantial reduction from the original government demand of THB 80.8 billion (approximately $2.4 billion). By 2024, in a similar case covering imports from Indonesia during 2000\u20132003, the appellate court further affirmed a much smaller fine of THB 130 million (approximately $3.9 million), down from the original THB 19.8 billion (approximately $584 million) sought by the government. These reductions demonstrate how the New Customs Act constrained Thailand's ability to impose large penalties, thereby lowering Philip Morris's financial risk in customs-related litigation over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PM(2022) \u2192 New Customs Act: In 2022, the appellate court upheld a significantly reduced fine (THB 1.2 billion vs. THB 80.8 billion) in the 2003\u20132006 import case, reflecting the New Customs Act\u2019s limitation on penalties.",
        "Hop 2: New Customs Act \u2192 Thailand: Thailand enacted the New Customs Act in May 2017, which limited the amount of fines that could be imposed in customs cases, directly affecting the legal framework under which Philip Morris Thailand was prosecuted.",
        "Hop 3: Thailand \u2190 PM(2024): In 2024, a similar case covering 2000\u20132003 imports from Indonesia saw the fine reduced from THB 19.8 billion to THB 130 million, again showing the Act\u2019s continued influence on lowering Philip Morris's exposure."

Pursuant to the assurance of voluntary compliance, Swedish Match North America LLC paid $1,200,000 to D.C. and agreed to undertake certain limited conduct obligations moving forward.\n\n## Other Litigation\n\nOn November 18, 2024, a putative class action, Neumark v. Swedish Match North America LLC , was filed before United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The complaint named Swedish Match North America LLC as the defendant. Plaintiff alleges that Swedish Match North America LLC violated federal and state  antitrust  laws  by,  among  other  things,  driving  a  competitor  from  the  market  through  purportedly  baseless  litigation  and  entering  into  an  allegedly anticompetitive agreement with PMI whereby PMI, through an indirect subsidiary, acquired Swedish Match North America LLC and eliminated itself as a competitor in the U.S. nicotine pouch market. Plaintiff asserts claims under the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act, state antitrust law, and for unjust enrichment. Plaintiff seeks to represent (i) all natural persons, businesses, entities, and corporations in the United States who purchased ZYN at retail during the class period; and (ii) all natural persons, businesses, entities, and corporations in the United States who live in states that have certain antitrust statutes who purchase ZYN at retail during the class period. Plaintiff is seeking damages (including treble damages as available under antitrust laws), costs, attorneys' fees, disgorgement of profit, preand post-judgment interest, and declaratory and injunctive relief (including a declaration that the acquisition of  Swedish  Match  North America  LLC by  PMI is unlawful  and  must  result  in  divestiture  or  be  enjoined). On  January  15,  2025,  Swedish  Match  North America  LLC  filed  a  motion  to  dismiss  the  complaint  with prejudice. Subsequently thereto, Plaintiff informed Swedish Match North America LLC that he will file an amended complaint, which is due on February 10, 2025 At this  time,  no  estimated  loss  has  been  accrued  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  this  proceeding  and  we  cannot  determine  the  likelihood  of  loss,  or reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, from this proceeding.\n\nThe Department of Special Investigations of the government of Thailand (\"DSI\") conducted an investigation into alleged underpayment by Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\") of customs duties and excise taxes relating to imports from  Indonesia covering the period 2000-2003.  On  January 26, 2017, the  Public Prosecutor filed charges against PM Thailand and its former Thai employee in the Bangkok Criminal Court alleging that PM Thailand and its former employee jointly and with the intention to defraud the Thai government under-declared import prices of cigarettes to avoid full payment of taxes and duties in connection with import entries during the period from January 2002 to July 2003. The government sought a fine of approximately THB 19.8 billion (approximately $584 million). In May 2017, Thailand enacted a new customs act. The new act, which took effect in November 2017, substantially limits the amount of fines that Thailand could seek in these proceedings. PM Thailand believes that its declared import prices are in compliance with the Customs V aluation Agreement of the World Trade Organization and Thai law, and that the allegations of the Public Prosecutor are inconsistent with several decisions already taken by Thai Customs and a Thai court. Trial in the case began in November 2018 and concluded in December 2019. In March 2020, the trial court found our subsidiary guilty of under-declaration of the prices and imposed a fine of approximately THB 130 million (approximately $3.9 million). The trial court dismissed all charges against the individual defendant. In April 2020, as required by Thai law, our subsidiary paid the fine. This payment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the period of payment. Our subsidiary filed an appeal of the trial court's decision. In addition, the Public  Prosecutor filed an appeal of the trial court's decision challenging the dismissal of charges against the individual defendant and the amount of the fine imposed. The appellate court issued its decision on the appeals on January 31, 2023. The appellate court affirmed the findings of under-declaration of import prices of cigarettes but reduced the fine imposed by the trial court. The appellate court directed the Public Prosecutor to coordinate with customs officials to calculate such reduced fine in accordance with the appellate court's decision. The appellate court affirmed the acquittal of the individual defendant. Our subsidiary has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Thailand. The Public Prosecutor has filed an appeal to the Supreme Court of Thailand challenging the dismissal of charges against the individual defendant and the amount of the fine. Thailand is required to refund any payment made by our subsidiary in excess of any fine assessed by the courts.\n\nIn July 2020, the Public Prosecutor's office of Rome, Italy, notified our Italian subsidiary, Philip Morris Italia S.r.l. ('PM Italia'), as well as  three former or current employees and a former external consultant of PM Italia in July and March 2020, respectively, that it concluded a preliminary investigation against them for alleged contravention of anti-corruption laws and related disruption of trade freedom. The Public Prosecutor alleges that the individuals involved promised certain personal favors to government officials from January to July of 2018 in exchange for favorable treatment for PM Italia, and that PM Italia lacked appropriate organizational controls to prevent the alleged actions by the individuals. On September 21, 2020, the Public Prosecutor issued his indictment and referred the matter to the court. At the preliminary hearing held on May 11, 2021, the judge decided to refer all charges/defendants (including our affiliate) to trial. The first trial hearing took place on September 22, 2021. BAT has filed a civil claim against PM Italia claiming vicarious liability for the alleged wrongdoings of its former or current employees and seeking EUR50 million (approximately $51 million) in damages. After various postponements, the trial started on September 25, 2023, and is expected to continue in 2025 through a series of evidentiary hearings. PM Italia believes it has strong defenses to the charges against it and will defend them vigorously.",

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions; erosion of consumer confidence; competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products; adult smoker willingness to convert to our SFPs; higher product taxes; higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories; unfair competition; and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products, restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our SFPs, or disproportionately impacts the commercialization of our products in relation to our competitors.\n\nCompetitors in our industry include Altria G roup, Inc., British American Tobacco plc, Japan Tobacco Inc., Imperial Brands plc, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, China,  Taiwan,  Thailand  and  V ietnam.  Some  competitors  have  different  profit,  volume  and  regulatory  objectives,  some  international  competitors  may  be  less susceptible than  PMI to changes in currency exchange rates, and some competitors may sell products in circumvention of applicable regulations that compete directly  with  our  products.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative  products  through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior product satisfaction, and without scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our SFPs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. See Item 1, Business-Competition for a description of the competitive environment in which we operate.\n\n## We may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences.\n\nOur  business  is  subject  to  changes  in  adult  consumer  preferences,  which  may  be  influenced  by  local  economic  conditions,  accessibility  to  our  products  and availability of accurate information related to our products.\n\n## To be successful, we must:\n\n- promote brand equity successfully;\n- anticipate and respond to new adult consumer trends;\n- ensure that our products meet our quality standards;\n- develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios;\n- improve productivity;\n- educate and encourage adult smokers to convert to our SFPs;\n- ensure effective adult consumer engagement, including communication about product characteristics and usage of SFPs;\n- mitigate the impact of developments that cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands;\n- provide excellent customer care;\n- ensure adequate production capacity to meet demand for our products; and\n- be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases.\n\nIn periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may tend to purchase low-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could be materially adversely impacted as a result. Such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation. In addition to economic uncertainty (including recessions and inflation) unusual weather events and global or local epidemics, endemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19) has and may change the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for our mid-price or premium-price brands.\n\n## Our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets, maintain sufficient production capacity, or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.\n\nOur profit growth may be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to meet the demand for our products with increased production capacity, to raise prices, or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ's VAR model estimated a one-day potential loss in fair value of interest rate-sensitive instruments under normal market conditions using a parametric delta-gamma approximation technique based on prior quarter observations. By 2023, the VAR model continued to assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence interval, but the VAR on a combined basis decreased from $284 million at September 30, 2023, to $255 million at September 28, 2024, partly due to reduced interest rate volatility. This indicates that despite similar modeling assumptions, the underlying market conditions had shifted, leading to a lower estimated risk exposure for MDLZ's interest rate-sensitive financial instruments.",

The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the above-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.\n\nThe VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A parametric delta-gamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR model, were:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Philip Morris reported that Turkey's cigarette market grew by 8.2%, driven by increased in-bound tourism, particularly by Turkish expatriates, which positively impacted PM's performance in the region. This growth was part of a broader increase in the Middle East & Africa region. However, by 2023, Turkey's classification as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP introduced significant financial pressures, including remeasurement losses of $194 million for the year. These losses stemmed from the volatility of the Turkish lira against the U.S. dollar, which negatively affected PM's financial condition and results of operations. Thus, while the earlier tourism boost had supported market expansion, the 2023 inflationary environment created operational headwinds, particularly in terms of currency remeasurement and cost volatility.",

Excluding  the  unfavorable  impact  of  the  Saudi  Arabia  customs  assessments, unfavorable  currency  and  acquisitions,  net  revenues  increased  by  18.3%,  reflecting:  favorable  volume/mix,  primarily  driven  by  higher cigarette volume (predominantly in PMI Duty Free and Turkey, partly offset by the GCC and North Africa), higher heated tobacco unit volume (mainly in Egypt, Jordan and PMI Duty Free) and favorable cigarette mix (mainly in the GCC, PMI Duty Free and Turkey); and a favorable pricing variance, mainly driven by combustible pricing (primarily in Egypt and Turkey); partially offset by lower fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets, shown in \"Cost/Other\".\n\nOperating  income,  excluding  currency  and  acquisitions,  increased  by  23.8%,  mainly  reflecting:  a  favorable  pricing  variance;  favorable volume/mix, driven by the same factors and geographies as for net revenues noted above; and lower manufacturing costs (primarily related to combustible products); partly offset by the unfavorable impact of the Saudi Arabia customs assessments, as noted above for net revenues; higher marketing, administration and research costs; and lower fees for certain distribution rights, as noted above for net revenues.\n\nMiddle East &amp; Africa - Total Market, PMI Shipment Volume and Market Share Commentaries\n\nThe estimated total market in the Middle East &amp; Africa increased by 2.9% to 560.5 billion units, mainly driven by:\n\n- Algeria, up by 6.2%, primarily reflecting the impact on adult smoker average daily consumption of the easing of pandemic-related measures, partly offset by the impact of price increases;\n- Egypt, up by 8.8%, mainly reflecting a favorable comparison due to pandemic-related supply chain shortages for competitors' products in 2020, as well as the favorable impact of adult smoker in-switching to cigarettes (mainly in the low-tax tier) from other combustible tobacco products;\n- South Africa, up by 13.2%, primarily reflecting a favorable comparison versus the second and third quarters of 2020, in which the total market was impacted by the pandemic-related ban on all tobacco sales from March 27th through August 17th, partly offset by a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade stemming from the ban; and\n- Turkey,  up  by  8.2%,  mainly  reflecting  the  impact  on  adult  smoker  average  daily  consumption  of  the  easing  of  pandemic-related measures,  coupled  with  increased  in-bound  tourism  (particularly  by  Turkish  expatriates),  partially  offset  by  a  higher  estimated prevalence of illicit trade;\n\n## partly offset by\n\n- International Duty Free, down by 10.6%, primarily reflecting the impact of government travel restrictions and reduced passenger traffic since the start of the pandemic in March 2020; and\n- Tunisia, down by 15.6%, mainly reflecting higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade (primarily due to market disruptions impacting product availability and the impact of price increases in July 2021).\n\nOur Regional market share increased by 1.1 points to 23.1%.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ used the parametric delta-gamma approximation technique to estimate the expected return distribution for interest rates, currencies, and commodity prices by observing movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and over each of the four prior quarters for average VAR amounts. In 2023, the company continued to use the same technique but updated the observation window to reflect the prior quarter for VAR amounts at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and again over each of the four prior quarters for average VAR amounts. This indicates that MDLZ maintained a consistent methodology for modeling risk in interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, while continuously updating the data inputs to reflect the most recent market conditions. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of interest rate-sensitive instruments remained within the modeled VAR framework, showing no significant structural changes in the risk profile year-over-year.",

For more information on our 2020 debt activity, see Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements .\n\nSee Note 10, Financial Instruments , for more information on our derivative activity.\n\n## Value at Risk:\n\nWe use a value at risk ('VAR') computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the above-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.\n\nThe VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A parametric delta-gamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR model, were:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ's Level 1 Financial Liabilities included exchange-traded commodity futures and listed options, with fair values determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges. These liabilities were directly linked to commodity futures used to hedge input costs like cocoa, sugar, and wheat. By 2024, the composition remained consistent, with Level 1 liabilities still consisting of exchange-traded commodity futures and listed options, and valuation continuing to rely on quoted market prices. However, the continued reliance on Level 1 instruments suggests that MDLZ maintained a high degree of transparency and market alignment in its hedging practices, implying ongoing exposure to market price volatility but with a consistent and observable valuation framework across both years.",

        "Hop 1: MDLZ(2022) \u2192 Commodity Futures: In 2022, MDLZ used commodity futures to hedge forecasted purchases of raw materials such as cocoa, sugar, and wheat.",

See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our asset derivatives is recorded within other current assets and other assets and the fair value of our liability derivatives is recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Non-cash changes in unrealized gains and losses related to our unsettled derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items, net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated, and those that are economic hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Currency movements related to our non-U.S. debt and our net investments in non-U.S. operations, as well as the related deferred taxes, are recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.\n\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.\n\nCommodity derivatives . We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nCurrency exchange derivatives . We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.

      "question": "How did the evolution of PMI's PMTA submissions for IQOS devices between 2022 and 2023 impact MO's commercialization rights and regulatory risk exposure in the U.S. market?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PMI had already received FDA authorization for the original IQOS Tobacco Heating System under a PMTA and had also submitted an MRTP application for IQOS 3, which was under review. However, due to a patent dispute, MO was forced to remove IQOS devices and HeatSticks from the market in late 2021. By 2023, the FDA had authorized PMTAs for three new tobacco-flavored varieties of Marlboro HeatSticks and had also authorized the marketing of IQOS 3 as an MRTP with a reduced exposure claim. Despite this progress, the U.S. government challenged MO's agreement to assign exclusive U.S. commercialization rights to PMI, asserting that court approval was required. This regulatory uncertainty, combined with the evolving PMTA landscape and the potential for future product removals, increased MO's regulatory risk exposure even as product authorizations expanded.",

        "Hop 1: MO(2022) \u2192 PMI: MO had exclusive U.S. commercialization rights to IQOS devices via an agreement with PMI, but was forced to remove products from the market due to a patent-related ITC cease-and-desist order effective November 2021.",
        "Hop 2: PMI \u2192 PMTA: PMI submitted PMTAs and MRTP applications for IQOS devices, including IQOS 3, which were under FDA review in 2022.",
        "Hop 3: PMTA \u2190 MO(2023): By 2023, the FDA had authorized PMTAs for new Marlboro HeatSticks and IQOS 3 as MRTPs, but MO agreed to assign back its commercialization rights to PMI in exchange for $2.7 billion, pending court approval, creating new regulatory uncertainty."

Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. Other than those amounts, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of any environmental remediation and compliance efforts that subsidiaries of Altria may undertake in the future. In the opinion of management, however, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows.\n\n## Guarantees and Other Similar Matters\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, certain subsidiaries of Altria have agreed to indemnify a limited number of third parties in the event of future litigation. At December 31, 2021, Altria and certain of its subsidiaries (i) had $48 million of unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and (ii) were contingently liable for guarantees related to their own performance, including $19 million for surety bonds recorded on its consolidated balance sheet. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries of Altria issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on Altria's liquidity.\n\nUnder the terms of a distribution agreement between Altria and PMI (the 'Distribution Agreement'), entered into as a result of Altria's 2008 spin-off of its former subsidiary PMI, liabilities concerning tobacco products will be allocated based in substantial part on the manufacturer. PMI will indemnify Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI. Altria does not have a related liability recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 as the fair value of this indemnification is insignificant. PMI has agreed not to seek indemnification with respect to the IQOS patent litigation discussed above under IQOS Litigation, excluding the patent infringement case filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\nPM USA has issued guarantees relating to Altria's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its $3.0 billion Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program.

Through these processes, a manufacturer could receive (i) a 'not substantially equivalent' determination, (ii) a denial of a PMTA or (iii) a marketing order withdrawal by the FDA on one or more products, which would require the removal of the product or products from the market. Such actions could have a material adverse impact on the business and consolidated results of operations of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\nProvisional Products : Most cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by PM USA and USSTC are 'Provisional Products.' Altria's subsidiaries timely submitted SE reports for these Provisional Products. PM USA and USSTC have received SE determinations on certain Provisional Products. Those products that were found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent (certain smokeless tobacco products) had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA's determinations; therefore, those determinations did not impact business results. PM USA and USSTC have other Provisional Products that continue to be subject to the FDA's pre-market review process. In the meantime, they can continue marketing these products unless the FDA determines that a specific Provisional Product is not substantially equivalent.\n\nIn addition, the FDA has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of Provisional Product SE reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further FDA review. PM USA and USSTC have Provisional Products included in this subset of products.\n\nWhile Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies believe their current Provisional Products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, they cannot predict how the FDA will ultimately apply law, regulation and guidance to their various SE reports. Should Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies receive unfavorable determinations on any SE reports currently pending with the FDA, they believe they can replace the vast majority of their respective product volumes with other FDA authorized products or with Grandfathered Products.\n\nNon-Provisional Products : Cigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after March 22, 2011 are 'Non-Provisional Products' and must receive a marketing order from the FDA prior to being offered for sale. Marketing orders for Non-Provisional Products may be obtained by filing an SE report, PMTA or using another pre-market pathway established by the FDA. Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies may not be able to obtain a marketing order for non-provisional products because the FDA may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval.\n\nProducts Regulated in 2016 : Manufacturers of products first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an SE report or PMTA by the filing deadline of September 9, 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market. These products can remain on the market during FDA review through court-allowed, case-by-case discretion, so long as the report or application was timely filed with the FDA. Due to the large number of applications received by September 9, 2020, the FDA did not complete its review of all submitted applications by September 9, 2021, although it represents that it has made decisions on more than 98% of the applications, with most being marketing denial orders and a few marketing granted orders for tobacco flavor e-vapor products. A number of the marketing denial orders are subject to litigation challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers. For those products still under FDA review, it is uncertain when and for how long the FDA may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its case-by-case discretion. For products (new or modified) not on the market as of August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file an SE report or PMTA and receive FDA authorization prior to marketing and selling the product.\n\nHelix submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020. JUUL submitted PMTAs to the FDA for its e-vapor device and the related tobacco and menthol flavors in July 2020. As of February 22, 2022, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or JUUL products. In addition, as of February 22, 2022, Middleton has received market orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn December 2013, Altria's subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with PMI, including an agreement that grants Altria an exclusive right to commercialize certain of PMI's heated tobacco products in the United States, subject to FDA authorization of the applicable products. PMI submitted a PMTA and a MRTP application with the FDA for its electronically heated tobacco products comprising the IQOS Tobacco Heating System . The IQOS devices heat, but do not burn tobacco. In April 2019, the FDA authorized the PMTA for the IQOS Tobacco Heating System and in July 2020, the FDA authorized the marketing of this system as a MRTP with a reduced exposure claim. In December 2020, the FDA authorized the PMTA for IQOS 3, an updated version of the IQOS devices. The MRTP authorization for the original IQOS device currently does not apply to the IQOS 3 device. PMI submitted an MRTP application for the IQOS 3 device in March 2021, which is currently under review by the FDA.\n\nIn September 2021, in connection with a patent dispute, the ITC issued a cease and desist order, effective as of November 29, 2021, banning (i) the importation of the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and infringing components into the United States and (ii) the sale, marketing and distribution of such imported products in the United States. As a result, PM USA removed the products from the",

      "question": "How did the CCAA proceedings involving Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. impact PMI's financial position in 2024, particularly regarding the CAD 32.5 billion settlement proposal and the resulting impairment of PMI's investment?",
      "answer": "In 2023, PMI recorded a $194 million pre-tax charge related to litigation involving Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH) in Canada. By 2024, RBH remained under CCAA protection, and a proposed global settlement of CAD 32.5 billion was filed, which would require RBH and other manufacturers to make payments based on net income until the amount is paid in full. This settlement proposal, combined with unresolved allocation issues among the defendants, led PMI to reassess its investment in RBH. As a result, PMI recorded a $2,316 million non-cash impairment charge in 2024, reducing the fair value of its investment in RBH to $714 million, down from $3,280 million at the time of deconsolidation in 2019. This reflects a significant deterioration in the expected financial return from the investment due to the evolving litigation and restructuring environment.",

          "chunk_text": "Litigation\" described below, could range into the billions of U.S. dollars. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual ex perience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. While, as discussed below, we have to date been largely successful in defending tobacco-related litigation, litigation is subject to uncertainty. Additionally, as reported further below, beginning in March 2024, litigation related to oral nicotine products was filed against us and our subsidiary before certain courts in the United States.\n\nWe and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, except as stated otherwise in this Note 18. Contingencies, it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIt is possible that our consolidated financial statements, including our results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Nevertheless, although litigation is subject to uncertainty, we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. All such cases are, and will continue to be, vigorously defended. However, we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so.\n\nAfter assessing the information available to it, ex cept as stated otherwise in this Note 18. Contingencies , (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending combustible tobacco product-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending combustible tobacco product-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any.\n\nCCAA Proceedings and Stay of Combustible Tobacco Product-Related Cases Pending in Canada\n\nAs a result of the Court of Appeal of Quebec's decision in both the L\u00e9tourneau and Blais cases described below, our subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH'), and the other defendants, JTI Macdonald Corp. (\"JTIM\"), and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\"), sought protection in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ('CCAA') on March 22, March 8, and March 12, 2019, respectively.  CCAA is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course. The initial CCAA order made by the Ontario Superior Court on March 22, 2019 authorizes RBH to pay all expenses incurred in carrying on its business in the ordinary course after the CCAA filing, including obligations to employees, vendors, and suppliers. RBH's financial results have been deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements since March 22, 2019.\n\nAs part of the CCAA proceedings, there is currently a comprehensive stay up to and including March 3, 2025 or the date on which the CCAA court issues an order on the Sanction Motion (discussed below) of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and the other defendants, including PMI and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), namely, the smoking and health class actions filed in various Canadian provinces and health care cost recovery actions. These proceedings are presented below under the caption ' Stayed Litigation - Canada .' Ernst &amp; Y oung Inc. has been appointed as monitor of RBH in the CCAA proceedings. On April 17, 2019, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that RBH and the other defendants will not be allowed to file an application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision in the L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases so long as the comprehensive stay of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation in Canada remains in effect and that the time period to file the application would be ex tended by the stay period.\n\nWhile RBH believes that the findings of liability and damages in both L\u00e9tourneau and the Blais cases were incorrect, the CCAA proceedings provide a forum for RBH to seek resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation pending in Canada. On October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement ('Proposed Plan') setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation against RBH, its affiliates, and its affiliates' indemnitees. The court-appointed mediator and monitors also filed substantially similar proposed plans for ITL and JTIM.\n\nUnder the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, ITL and JTIM (together, the 'Companies') would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approx imately $22.3 billion). This amount would be funded by an upfront payment equal to the companies' cash and cash equivalents on hand plus court deposits (subject to an aggregate withholding of CAD 750 million (approximately $514 million) of working capital) and annual payments based on a percentage of the Companies' aggregate net income after taxes (excluding that generated by alternative products such as heat-not-burn, nicotine pouches, and e-vapor) until the global settlement amount is paid in full. As stated in the Proposed Plan, the issue of allocation of the CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM (\"Allocation Issue\") remains unresolved. RBH and its affiliates, including PMI and its indemnitees, would obtain a release of claims relating to the manufacture, marketing, sale, or use of or ex posure",

          "chunk_text": "PMI holds a 49% equity interest in United Arab Emirates-based Emirati Investors-TA (FZC) ('EITA').  PMI holds an approximate 25% economic interest in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Tabacs Alg\u00e9ro-Emiratie ('STAEM'), an Algerian joint venture that is  51% owned by EITA and 49% by the Algerian state-owned enterprise Management et D\u00e9veloppement des Actifs et des Ressources Holding (\"MADAR Holding\"), which manufactures and distributes under license some of PMI's brands (SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA segment).\n\nIn  April  2023,  PMI  acquired  an  approx imate  economic  interest  of 25%  in  United  Tobacco  Company  (\"UTC\").  UTC  is  an  entity  incorporated  in  Egypt  which manufactures products under license for PMI's Egyptian subsidiary. On May 16, 2024, PMI acquired a controlling interest in UTC. For further details, see Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures .\n\nIn May 2024, PMI acquired an indirect economic interest of 14.7% in Eastern Company ('Eastern\"), Egypt's largest cigarette manufacturer which also includes cigars and pipe tobacco, among others, in its portfolio. PMI accounted for its investment in Eastern under the equity method of accounting as it has the indirect ability to participate in Eastern's policy making processes. In relation to the acquisition, PMI subsequently entered into an agreement in August 2024 to guarantee certain credit facilities and repayment of certain bank loan liabilities. The max imum amount of these guarantee obligations is $385 million and they will be in effect until 2034. As of December 31, 2024, PMI has not finalized the basis difference allocation resulting from the investment.\n\nThe initial investments in Megapolis Distribution BV , EITA, Eastern and UTC (up to the acquisition of controlling interest in UTC on May 16, 2024) have been recorded  at  cost  and  are  included  in  equity  investments  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Transactions  between  these  equity  method  investees  and  PMI subsidiaries are considered to be related-party transactions and are included in the tables below.\n\n## Equity securities:\n\nOn March 22, 2019, PMI's wholly owned subsidiary in Canada, Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. ('RBH') obtained an initial order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (\"CCAA\"), which is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees. The administration of the CCAA process, principally relating to the powers provided to the court under the CCAA and the oversight provided by the court appointed monitor, removes certain elements of control of the business from both PMI and RBH. As a result, PMI determined that it no longer had a controlling financial interest over RBH as defined in ASC 810 (Consolidation), and deconsolidated RBH as of the date of the CCAA filing.\n\nSince the deconsolidation of RBH on March 22, 2019, PMI has accounted for its continuing investment in RBH in accordance with ASC 321 (Investments-Equity Securities) as an equity security, without readily determinable fair value, and recorded its continuing investment in RBH at fair value of $3,280 million, which included the estimated settlement amount at the date of deconsolidation, within equity investments.\n\nOn October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement ('Proposed Plan') setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation. Under the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\") and JTI Macdonald Corp (\"JTIM\") would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approximately $22.3 billion). A significant determinative factor in the analysis of impairment indicators was the issue of allocation of CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM which remained unresolved at the time of filing.\n\nThere has been no agreed allocation under the Proposed Plan and there has been no ruling from the CCAA court on the matter. On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the Proposed Plan with the CCAA court (for further details, see Note 18. Contingencies ). Developments, including the positions taken by RBH in this objection and the positions taken by other parties in related filings narrowed the range of possible outcomes with respect to the allocation of the aggregate  settlement  amount  of  CAD 32.5 billion among  RBH,  ITL, and  JTIM, which was determined to be an indicator that PMI's investment in RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the Proposed plan, PMI evaluated its investment in RBH for potential impairment and concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in  RBH was lower than its carrying value. As a result,  PMI performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in RBH as of December 31, 2024, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a recognized subsequent event. The fair value of PMI's continuing investment in RBH of $714 million represented the estimated fair value of the underlying business, net of PMI's best estimate of the share of the aggregate global settlement amount that could be allocated to RBH, and was determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nIn determining the fair value of PMI's investment in RBH, PMI made various judgements, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were the discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the fair value of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada. In addition, significant estimates were made with respect to the allocation amount of the aggregate global",

By 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which were collateralized with restricted cash included on MO's consolidated balance sheet.

In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 10, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Long-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Purchase Obligations - We have entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results.

      "question": "What does the absence of appeal bond disclosures in Altria's 2024 filing suggest about PM USA's litigation risk exposure and its financial implications compared to the $35 million in appeal bonds posted in 2023?",
      "answer": "The absence of appeal bond disclosures in Altria\u2019s 2024 filing suggests that PM USA may have either resolved key litigation cases or altered its litigation risk management strategy compared to 2023, when it had posted $35 million in appeal bonds collateralized with restricted cash. In 2023, these bonds were explicitly tied to stays of adverse verdicts pending appeal, indicating active litigation exposure. By 2024, with no mention of appeal bonds, it is possible that PM USA either settled or exhausted appeals in these cases, reducing the need for such financial assurances. This change could signal a decline in immediate litigation-related financial obligations, potentially freeing up restricted cash or reducing interest costs tied to litigation stays. However, the 2024 filing still highlights ongoing litigation risks, including e-vapor product litigation involving NJOY, suggesting that while legacy tobacco litigation exposure may have decreased, new categories continue to carry risk, albeit managed differently.",

of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2023. From time to time, we also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. As further discussed in Note 19, as part of the supplier financing program, Altria guarantees the financial obligations of ALCS under the financing program agreement. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 10, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Long-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Purchase Obligations - We have entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

By 2023, this number decreased to 28,522 thousand. This reduction of 8,506 thousand securities indicates a decline in CL's available capacity for future equity-based employee incentives, suggesting either increased issuance of securities in 2023 or a strategic decision to limit future equity compensation.",

In 2023, the model continued to assume normal market conditions but updated the historical observation window dynamically\u2014using the prior quarter for point-in-time VAR and four prior quarters for average VAR. This refinement in volatility assumptions led to a more responsive risk estimate, with the 2023 VAR amounts reflecting a broader and potentially more stable market view than in 2022, thereby influencing the magnitude of the estimated one-day loss.",

For more information on our 2020 debt activity, see Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements .\n\nSee Note 10, Financial Instruments , for more information on our derivative activity.\n\n## Value at Risk:\n\nWe use a value at risk ('VAR') computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the above-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.\n\nThe VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A parametric delta-gamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR model, were:\n\n",

Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our bifurcated exchange options are valued, as derivative instrument liabilities, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related to the market price of the underlying note and associated credit spread combined with the share of price, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility of the JDE Peet's shares over the life of the option. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our derivative contracts do not have a legal right of set-off.

Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our bifurcated exchange options are valued, as derivative instrument liabilities, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related to the market price of the underlying note and associated credit spread combined with the share of price, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility of the JDE Peet's shares over the life of the option. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our derivative contracts do not have a legal right of set-off. We manage the credit risk in connection with these and all our derivatives by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PM USA guaranteed Altria's obligations under its debt securities, credit agreement, and commercial paper program, with no cap on liability other than fraudulent conveyance limits. By 2024, Altria continued to rely on PM USA for similar guarantees, but the indemnification framework with PMI remained unchanged, with PMI indemnifying Altria for liabilities related to products it manufactured or had contract manufactured. The unused letters of credit dropped slightly from $48 million in 2021 (reported in 2022 filing) to $43 million in 2024, indicating stable but slightly reduced contingent exposure. This reveals a consistent risk allocation strategy where PM USA remains the primary guarantor while PMI indemnifies for product-specific liabilities, with no material changes in recorded liabilities on Altria\u2019s balance sheet.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n\nPM USA (the 'Guarantor'), which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

Cash paid in connection with such legal title, together with an immaterial amount attributable to open market purchases that were executed in December 2022 but settled in January 2023, amounted to $883 million and was included in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023. While PMI paid the referenced amounts and acquired legal title to the shares, under the Swedish Companies Act the redemption process was not complete until the final redemption price was determined by an arbitral tribunal. On September 12, 2023, the arbitral tribunal determined the final redemption price to be Swedish krona (SEK) 115.07, unchanged from the SEK 115.07 that PMI paid per share in connection with obtaining legal title to the shares. This process was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 when the opportunity to appeal the arbitral tribunal determination ended.\n\nSwedish  Match  is  a  market  leader  in  oral  nicotine  delivery  with  a  significant  presence  in  the  United  States  market.

      "answer": "In 2023, PM USA guaranteed MO's outstanding debt securities, commercial paper program, and borrowings under the credit agreement, with $1.0 billion in new senior unsecured notes issued in November 2023. By 2024, MO faced a potential $125 million impairment charge on its e-vapor reporting unit's goodwill due to increased discount rate assumptions, signaling heightened financial risk. The continued reliance on PM USA's guarantees in 2024 meant that MO's ability to manage its debt obligations remained tied to the performance and creditworthiness of PM USA, which itself was exposed to litigation and regulatory risks. This interdependence amplified MO's financial risk profile as impairment charges could constrain cash flow flexibility, making the guarantee structure more critical yet more vulnerable to external pressures.",

        "Hop 1: MO(2023) \u2192 MO Debt Securities: MO issued $1.0 billion in new senior unsecured notes in November 2023, with PM USA guaranteeing these obligations.",

In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

      "answer": "In 2022, MDLZ generated $2,082 million in chocolate revenues from the AMEA region, representing 8.3% of total segment revenue for that product category. By 2024, MDLZ continues to operate in the AMEA region, indicating that the region remains a strategic part of its global footprint. The sustained operational presence, combined with the significant contribution from chocolate revenues in 2022, suggests that MDLZ maintained a strategic focus on the AMEA region due to its strong performance in key product categories like chocolate.",

      "answer": "In 2023, PM identified that increased governmental actions\u2014such as higher cigarette taxes, plain packaging laws, and restrictions on product display\u2014were expected to reduce consumption levels and increase the risk of illicit trade, including contraband, counterfeit, and cross-border purchases. These regulatory pressures were specifically noted to create a shift from premium to lower-priced cigarette categories and encourage illicit behavior due to higher legal product costs. By 2024, PM reported that these risks had materialized, with contraband and illicit trade significantly impacting revenues, particularly due to the heavy counterfeiting of the Marlboro brand and the proliferation of non-tax-paid products. The evolution from regulatory pressure in 2023 to illicit trade exposure in 2024 created a causal chain where policy changes directly influenced PM's financial performance through increased contraband activity.",

Acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and/or anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses or enter into strategic business relationships on favorable terms ahead of our competitors, or that such acquisitions or strategic business development relationships will be accretive to earnings or improve our competitive position. In addition, we may not have a controlling position in certain strategic investments or relationships, which could impact the extent to which the intended financial growth and other benefits from these investments or relationships may ultimately materialize.\n\n## Our ability to achieve our strategic goals may be impaired if we fail to attract, motivate and retain the best global talent and effectively align our organizational design with the goals of our transformation.\n\nTo be successful, we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working, align our talent and organizational design with our increasingly complex business needs, and innovate and transform to a consumer-centric business. We compete for talent, including in areas that are relatively new to us such as digital, information technology, and life sciences, with companies in the consumer products, technology, pharmaceutical and other sectors that enjoy greater societal acceptance. As a result, we may be unable to attract, motivate and retain the best global talent with the right degree of diversity, ex perience and skills to achieve our strategic goals.\n\n## Risks Related to Illicit Trade\n\n## Our revenues may be materially adversely affected as a result of counterfeiting, contraband, cross-border purchases, illicit products, non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers and other non-compliant or illicit cigarettes or smoke-free products.\n\nLarge quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market. We believe that Marlboro is  the  m ost  heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity.  Counterfeits of our smoke-free products are not subject to our scientific validation  procedures,  are  unlikely  to  meet  our  product  quality  standards,  and  may  materially  adversely  affect  the  reputation  of  our  smoke-free  products  with consumers, regulators, and other stakeholders.

      "answer": "In 2022, PEP's joint venture with Unilever for Lipton Tea was explicitly described in the 10-K filing as operating across Europe, Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AME SA), and Asia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and China Region (APAC). By 2024, the joint venture remained in place but was also explicitly mentioned in the LatAm segment, indicating an expansion of its geographic scope. This evolution affected how beverage volume was reported, as in 2024, PEP clarified that beverage volume included products from joint ventures like Lipton Tea and specified that these volumes were reported using standardized metrics (CSE and BCS converted to an 8-ounce-case metric). The addition of LatAm to the joint venture structure and the more detailed explanation of volume reporting methodology in 2024 suggest a more integrated and standardized approach to measuring joint venture performance across all regions.",

      "answer": "The 2023 Thai appellate court decision, which affirmed under-declaration of import prices but reduced the fine from THB 130 million to an undetermined lower amount, reinforced PM Thailand's long-standing argument that its customs declarations aligned with WTO valuation rules. This outcome strengthened Philip Morris's legal position in the broader context of the unresolved WTO Panel Decision from 2010, which had ruled that Thailand had no grounds to challenge PM Thailand's declared customs values. Despite the appellate ruling, Thailand's incomplete compliance with the WTO decision created regulatory uncertainty that likely influenced Philip Morris's 2024 import strategy. As a result, the company may have adjusted its customs valuation methods or import routes to mitigate further legal exposure or financial penalties in Thailand, especially given the ongoing bilateral discussions between Thailand and the Philippines at the WTO.",

We describe certain pending matters in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies .\n\nIn November 2010, a World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") panel issued its decision in a dispute between the Philippines and Thailand, concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\") into Thailand. The decision concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the Thai government and created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports.  Thailand agreed to fully comply with the decision, but the Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision and commenced challenges at the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO Appellate Body is not operational, and the appeals by Thailand are suspended indefinitely. In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues and the countries have since agreed to seek the establishment of a bilateral consultative mechanism, with the goal of reaching a comprehensive settlement of their dispute, consistent with their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreements, as well as the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families in the country. We continue commercial activities in select locations where safety allows, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and supplies the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement. Production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended. On June 20, 2023, we announced the investment of $30 million in a new production facility in the Lviv region, in Western Ukraine. Preparatory work for the facility began in July 2023. The new production facility was completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and local production commenced in April 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our Ukrainian operations had approximately $0.6 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances.\n\nIn Russia, we are continuously assessing the evolving situation in the country. This includes regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. As of December 31, 2024, our Russian operations had approximately $2.7 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $1.0 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles).\n\nAdditionally, we hold a 23% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution B.V ., which was the holding company of JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), pursuant to Dutch law, PMI's distributor in Russia. On July 18, 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Trade filed a petition before the Arbitrazh Court of Moscow seeking the forced localization of JSC TK Megapolis. On December 5, 2024, JSC TK Megapolis registered the transfer of this equity interest to PMI affiliate ZAO Philip Morris Izhora. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. Related Parties - Equity Investments and Other and Item 8, Note 18.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact on cost of sales was approximately $580 million. In 2024, the impact on cost of sales was approximately 30% of the 2023 level, benefiting from lower prices for direct materials and utilities, despite continued pressure on tobacco leaf costs. In 2025, we expect certain inflationary elements such as direct materials and utilities to stabilize, with a moderate overall increase in inflationary pressures driven by tobacco leaf costs.\n\nInflationary impacts driven by higher wages have resulted from merit increases that reflect local inflation as we continuously evaluate our compensation and benefit offerings to be competitive with the current market. Increased transportation costs resulted from increased shipping rates for all modes of transportation (air, ocean and inland) due to ocean and air capacity constraints. Increases in",

      "answer": "MO's financial planning for heated tobacco stick products in 2024 was directly influenced by the regulatory challenges faced by Horizon in 2023. In 2023, Horizon's success in commercializing HTS products was explicitly stated to be dependent on the 'receipt of regulatory authorizations,' highlighting a key vulnerability in the business strategy. By 2024, this dependency was reflected in MO's impairment testing assumptions, where the 'timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products'\u2014including HTS\u2014was explicitly called out as a critical variable in estimating the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit and related intangible assets. The 2024 financial planning incorporated a hypothetical 1% increase in the discount rate, which would have triggered a $125 million impairment charge, underscoring the sensitivity of valuation models to regulatory delays. This evolution demonstrates how MO's financial strategy adapted to the uncertainty surrounding Horizon's regulatory hurdles, embedding them directly into impairment risk and long-term revenue forecasting models.",

Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

      "answer": "In 2022, PepsiCo's APAC segment disclosed $4 million in acquisition and divestiture-related charges, while in 2023, no such charges were reported for APAC. This reduction in corporate activity coincided with a consistent 23% revenue split attributed to beverages in APAC across both years, as shown in the regional financial breakdown. The lack of acquisition activity in 2023 suggests a strategic shift from expansion through deals to potentially focusing on organic growth or cost optimization in the APAC region, especially for the beverage business which had maintained a stable revenue contribution despite the broader strategic moves.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PEP(2022) \u2192 Beverages: PepsiCo's beverage business was a distinct division (PBNA) in 2022 with specific revenue contributions, including in the APAC region.",
        "Hop 2: Beverages \u2192 APAC: In both 2022 and 2023, the APAC region consistently attributed 23% of its revenue to beverages, indicating a stable business performance in that category.",
        "Hop 3: APAC \u2190 PEP(2023): In 2023, PepsiCo disclosed $0 in acquisition and divestiture-related charges for APAC, compared to $4 million in 2022, signaling a change in corporate activity in the region."

      "answer": "In 2023, PepsiCo held a 23% stake in the Beverages segment within the APAC region, a proportion that had remained stable compared to 2022 (also 23%). By 2024, the company allocated $10 million in capital expenditures to the APAC region, up from $8 million in 2023. This modest increase in capital allocation contrasts with the relatively small share of Beverages in APAC compared to other regions like Europe (48% Beverages stake) and AMESA (29%), which received larger capital allocations ($14 million and $123 million respectively in 2024). This suggests that while PepsiCo maintained its ownership stake in Beverages in APAC, its capital investment prioritization in 2024 did not strongly emphasize the APAC region relative to others.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Coca-Cola's U.S. postretirement benefit plans were primarily funded through a VEBA trust that focused on liquid assets to align with the timing and level of expected future benefit payments. By 2023, while the VEBA still emphasized liquidity due to the same expected benefit payment profile, the company overall increased its alternative investment allocation to 35%, which included hedge funds, private equity, and real estate. This broader shift suggests a strategic effort to enhance returns across its broader investment portfolio while maintaining liquidity within the VEBA to meet near-term obligations.",

      "answer": "In 2022, KO disclosed that Costa Rica was among jurisdictions providing tax incentive grants, with expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2036, and these grants favorably impacted KO's income tax expense by $381 million in 2021 alone. Since Coca-Cola FEMSA operates nationwide in Costa Rica (as noted in KO's 2022 filing), the approaching expiration of these tax incentives would have directly affected FEMSA's effective tax rate and net income in 2023. Under KO's equity method accounting (detailed in the 2023 filing), KO's consolidated net income includes its proportionate share of FEMSA's earnings. Therefore, the reduction in FEMSA's tax benefits from Costa Rica would have flowed through to KO's financial statements, decreasing its reported equity income from FEMSA in 2023.",

('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Altria provided significant financial backing to PM USA through debt guarantees totaling $1.0 billion in new senior unsecured notes, ensuring continued operational stability for its key cigarette subsidiary. This financial support helped maintain PM USA's dominant market position as the largest cigarette company in the U.S., even as cigarette shipment volumes declined by 9.9% during the year. By 2024, despite this volume drop, Altria still valued the cigarette segment at $24 billion in combined goodwill ($22 billion) and indefinite-lived intangible assets ($2 billion), indicating that the financial backing in 2023 likely preserved brand strength and market dominance, which underpinned the segment's high valuation in the following year.",

      "question": "How did the increased prevalence of illicit trade in Turkey in 2022 impact PM's cigarette volume growth and pricing variance in that market, and how did the company's operational response to Turkey's inflationary pressures in 2023 affect its ability to counteract those illicit trade challenges?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PM reported that Turkey's total market increased by 8.2%, driven by easing pandemic restrictions and increased tourism, but this growth was partially offset by a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade, which constrained cigarette volume and pricing variance (chunk 2). Despite favorable volume/mix and pricing variance in Turkey, illicit trade dampened the potential growth. In 2023, Turkey was one of the four economies under highly inflationary accounting, which led to significant currency remeasurement losses of $194 million for PM, further complicating its ability to implement pricing strategies or invest in anti-illicit trade measures (chunk 3). The combination of illicit trade and inflationary pressures in consecutive years created a compounded challenge for PM in maintaining market share and revenue growth in Turkey (chunk 1).",

          "chunk_text": "Net earnings attributable to PMI of $9.1 billion increased by $1.1 billion or 13.1%. This increase was due primarily to higher operating income as discussed above, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Basic and diluted EPS of $5.83 increased by 13.0%. Excluding a favorable currency impact of $0.12, diluted EPS increased by 10.7%.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019\n\nFor a discussion comparing our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, with the year ended December 31, 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Discussion and Analysis - Consolidated Operating Results in  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2021.\n\n## Operating Results by Business Segment\n\n## Business Environment\n\n## Taxes, Legislation, Regulation and Other Matters Regarding the Manufacture, Marketing, Sale and Use of Tobacco Products\n\nThe tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash  flows  and  financial  position.  These  challenges,  which  are  discussed  below  and  in  ' Cautionary  Factors  That  May  Affect  Future Results ,' include:\n\n- regulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other nicotinecontaining products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or even ban certain of our products;\n- fiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;\n- illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called 'illicit whites';\n- intense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;\n- pending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies ; and\n- governmental investigations.\n\nRegulatory  Restrictions: The  tobacco  industry  operates  in  a  highly  regulated  environment.  The  well-known  risks  of  smoking  have  led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.\n\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  (the  'FCTC')  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (the  \"WHO\"),  which  entered  into  force  in  2005.  The  FCTC  has  as  its  main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others.  The  FCTC  governing  body,  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  ('CoP'),  has  also  adopted  non-binding  guidelines  and  policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty. In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for  more  scientific  assessment  and  improved  reporting  to  define  policy  on  heated  tobacco  products.  Similar  to  its  previous  policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\n\nPrior to CoP 9 that took place in November 2021, the WHO and the WHO FCTC Secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products. The reports were noted by CoP 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to CoP 10, currently scheduled  for  2023.  It  is  not  possible  to  predict  whether  or  to  what  extent  measures  recommended  by  the  WHO's  reports  will  be implemented as the reports are not binding to the WHO Member States.\n\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today, but how fast, and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that recognize a significant difference on a risk continuum between combustible tobacco on the one hand and non-combustible tobacco and other nicotine-containing products on the other. Regulation should include measures that will accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such products to",
