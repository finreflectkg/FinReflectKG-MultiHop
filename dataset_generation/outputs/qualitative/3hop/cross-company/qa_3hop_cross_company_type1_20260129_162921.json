The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "LOW applies pricing models to determine fair value for Level 2 assets and uses an income approach with significant unobservable inputs like volatility and expected term for its Level 3 contingent consideration related to the Canadian retail business sale. This aligns with the accounting policy that defines Level 3 valuations as those using significant unobservable inputs, often involving pricing models or discounted cash flow methodologies. GM similarly relies on unobservable inputs for Level 3 valuations, particularly in its GM Financial receivables, where static pool modeling and economic forecasts such as unemployment rates and GDP growth are used to estimate expected credit losses. Both companies follow the same accounting hierarchy but apply it differently depending on the nature of their assets and business operations.",

Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 - Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable.\n\nMarketable Debt Securities We generally classify marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. V arious factors, including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value with non-credit related unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Noncredit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent non-binding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of ex it prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the finance receivables. For retail finance receivables, GM Financial uses static pool modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected remaining life of the finance receivables. The economic forecasts incorporate factors which vary by region that GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as forecasted auto industry conditions, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.  Net realizable value is the estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  less  cost  to  sell,  and  considers  general  market  and  economic  conditions,  periodic  reviews  of  current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Inventories are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete, with a primary focus on productive material, supplies, work in process and parts and accessories.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of typically two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on forecasted auction proceeds when there is a reliable basis to make such a determination. Realization of the residual values is dependent  on  the  future  ability  to  market  the  vehicles  under  prevailing  market  conditions.  The  estimate  of  the  residual  value  is  evaluated  over  the  life  of  the arrangement and adjustments may be made to the extent the expected value of the vehicle changes.",

These hedges, primarily in euros, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds, and Chinese yuan, are designed to offset earnings fluctuations from currency movements. Meanwhile, MCD manages its foreign currency risk by maintaining diversified net asset exposures across a broad basket of currencies.

O ur m ost significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product C osts - N IKE 's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denom inated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain N I KE  entities purchase product from  the N T C , a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys N IKE  branded products from  third-party factories, predom inantly in U .S. Dollars. T he N T C , whose functional currency is the U .S. D ollar, then sells the products to N I KE  entities in their respective functional currencies. N T C  sales to a N I KE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the N T C .\n- b. Other N IKE  entities purchase product directly from  third-party factories predom inantly in U .S. D ollars. T hese purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE  entities with a functional currency other than the U .S. D ollar.\n\nI n both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U .S. D ollar reduces inventory costs incurred by N IKE  whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: N IKE  operates a foreign currency adjustm ent program  with certain factories. T he program  is designed to m ore effectively m anage foreign currency risk by assum ing certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, som e of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. U nder this program , our paym ents to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the labor, m aterials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of N IKE  branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denom inated.\n\nAs an offset to the im pacts of the fluctuating U .S. D ollar on our non-functional currency denom inated product purchases described above, a strengthening U .S. D ollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces N IKE 's U .S. D ollar inventory cost. C onversely, a weakening U .S. D ollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated E xternal Sales - A portion of our N IKE  Brand and C onverse revenues associated with E uropean operations are earned in currencies other than the E uro (e.g., the British P ound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the E uro as its functional currency. T hese sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other C osts - N on-functional currency denom inated costs, such as endorsem ent contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated M onetary Assets and Liabilities - O ur global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, prim arily receivables and payables, including intercom pany receivables and payables, denom inated in currencies other than their functional currencies. T hese balance sheet item s are subject to rem easurem ent which m ay create fluctuations in O ther (incom e) expense, net within our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are m anaged on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk m anagem ent program . W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and m ay also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the rem aining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denom inated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to m anage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denom inated m onetary assets and liabilities subject to rem easurem ent are not form ally designated as hedging instrum ents. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instrum ents are recognized in O ther (incom e) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency im pact of the rem easurem ent of the related non-functional currency denom inated asset or liability being hedged.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 45",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

      "question": "How does the treatment of dividend equivalents on unvested restricted stock units at HD influence the issuance of additional shares, and how does this compare to LOW's delivery of additional shares under its ASR agreements in fiscal 2021?",
      "answer": "At HD, dividend equivalents accrue on unvested restricted stock units and are paid out in the form of additional shares upon vesting. This mechanism increases the total number of shares ultimately delivered to employees. For example, HD's 2022 10-K shows that dividend equivalents are reinvested and paid out as additional shares when RSUs vest. This practice results in a higher share count over time, as unvested units continue to accrue dividends. In contrast, LOW delivered additional shares in the context of accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements. In fiscal 2021, LOW executed ASR agreements in Q1, Q4, and Q2, under which it received additional shares at settlement\u20140.2 million, 1.6 million, and 4 million shares respectively\u2014depending on the final calculation of the stock price during the settlement period.

At the grant date of the award, recipients of restricted stock are granted voting rights and generally receive dividends on unvested shares, paid in the form of cash on each dividend payment date. Dividends paid on unvested shares were immaterial for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019. Additionally, the majority of our restricted stock awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service.\n\nWe have also granted performance share awards under the Plans. These awards provide for the issuance of shares of our common stock at the end of the three-year performance cycle based upon our performance against target average ROIC and operating profit over that performance cycle. Additionally, the awards become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service and minimum performance targets are achieved. Recipients of performance share awards have no voting rights until the shares are issued following completion of the performance period. Dividend equivalents accrue on the performance shares (as reinvested shares) and are paid upon the payout of the award based upon the actual number of shares earned.\n\nThe fair value of the restricted stock and performance shares is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse.\n\nRestricted Stock Units. Each restricted stock unit entitles the associate to one share of common stock to be received upon vesting up to five years after the grant date. Additionally, the majority of these awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. Recipients of restricted stock units have no voting rights until the vesting of the award. Recipients receive dividend equivalents that accrue on unvested units and are paid out in the form of additional shares of stock on the vesting date. The fair value of the restricted stock units is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and is expensed over the period during which the units vest.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of restricted stock, performance shares, and restricted stock unit activity during fiscal 2021:\n\n",

The OECD's framework proposes a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis, and although many countries are incorporating Pillar 2 model rule concepts into domestic laws, differences in implementation timelines and domestic tax adjustments may affect the tax's impact on multinational companies like MCD and SBUX differently.",

      "answer": "NKE actively uses option contracts as part of its foreign currency risk management program to hedge exposures from product costs, external sales, and other costs, with $9.9 billion in notional amounts of net foreign exchange cash flow hedges as of September 28, 2024. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, with mark-to-market gains and losses deferred in AOCI, including $99 million in net deferred gains expected to mature in the next twelve months. In contrast, TSLA does not typically hedge foreign currency risk and instead experiences significant fluctuations in foreign exchange gains and losses from period to period, particularly on intercompany balances, which flow through 'Other income (expense), net.' This highlights a more proactive hedging strategy by NKE versus TSLA\u2019s reactive exposure to foreign currency assets.",

O ur m ost significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product C osts - N IKE 's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denom inated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain N I KE  entities purchase product from  the N T C , a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys N IKE  branded products from  third-party factories, predom inantly in U .S. Dollars. T he N T C , whose functional currency is the U .S. D ollar, then sells the products to N I KE  entities in their respective functional currencies. N T C  sales to a N I KE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the N T C .\n- b. Other N IKE  entities purchase product directly from  third-party factories predom inantly in U .S. D ollars. T hese purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE  entities with a functional currency other than the U .S. D ollar.\n\nI n both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U .S. D ollar reduces inventory costs incurred by N IKE  whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: N IKE  operates a foreign currency adjustm ent program  with certain factories. T he program  is designed to m ore effectively m anage foreign currency risk by assum ing certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, som e of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. U nder this program , our paym ents to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the labor, m aterials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of N IKE  branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denom inated.\n\nAs an offset to the im pacts of the fluctuating U .S. D ollar on our non-functional currency denom inated product purchases described above, a strengthening U .S. D ollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces N IKE 's U .S. D ollar inventory cost. C onversely, a weakening U .S. D ollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated E xternal Sales - A portion of our N IKE  Brand and C onverse revenues associated with E uropean operations are earned in currencies other than the E uro (e.g., the British P ound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the E uro as its functional currency. T hese sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other C osts - N on-functional currency denom inated costs, such as endorsem ent contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated M onetary Assets and Liabilities - O ur global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, prim arily receivables and payables, including intercom pany receivables and payables, denom inated in currencies other than their functional currencies. T hese balance sheet item s are subject to rem easurem ent which m ay create fluctuations in O ther (incom e) expense, net within our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are m anaged on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk m anagem ent program . W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and m ay also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the rem aining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denom inated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to m anage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denom inated m onetary assets and liabilities subject to rem easurem ent are not form ally designated as hedging instrum ents. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instrum ents are recognized in O ther (incom e) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency im pact of the rem easurem ent of the related non-functional currency denom inated asset or liability being hedged.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 45",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

      "answer": "Panasonic has a long-standing battery supply relationship with GM, evidenced by agreements dating back to 2011, including a Supply Agreement dated October 5, 2011, and multiple amendments through 2020. In contrast, Panasonic's partnership with Tesla is more deeply integrated and focused on Gigafactory operations, with agreements such as the Amended and Restated General Terms and Conditions for Gigafactory entered into on June 10, 2020. While GM's relationship centers around supply agreements, Tesla's includes co-location in Gigafactory facilities, joint investment letters, and detailed production pricing frameworks, indicating a more strategic and operationally collaborative arrangement.",

      "answer": "Tesla's risk of cost overruns in new factory ramp-ups, particularly related to establishing proprietary battery cell production and scaling global operations, exposes them to inflationary pressures from supply chain constraints and labor shortages. Raytheon's fixed-price contracts are similarly vulnerable, as rising material and labor costs due to inflation could lead to losses if cost overruns occur, especially given their limited ability to adjust pricing on these contracts. Starbucks, by contrast, actively uses fixed-price contracts as part of a proactive hedging strategy to manage commodity price risk, particularly for green coffee and dairy products, with maturities generally not exceeding three years. While Tesla and Raytheon face cost pressures that could undermine profitability under fixed-price arrangements, Starbucks leverages such contracts as a mitigant rather than a risk, highlighting differing strategic approaches to inflation exposure across industries.",

      "question": "How does GM's compliance cost burden under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act compare with Tesla's investment in meeting global Vehicle Safety Standards, given the differing regulatory enforcement mechanisms outlined in the Act?",
      "answer": "GM faces substantial compliance costs due to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act's requirement to meet U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standards and potential recall obligations, which are costly and growing more complex. The Act also mandates that non-compliant or defective vehicles must be recalled, adding to financial exposure. Tesla, on the other hand, must meet Vehicle Safety Standards in multiple jurisdictions, many of which differ materially from U.S. requirements, necessitating additional investment in vehicle design and certification. Unlike GM, Tesla also faces unique challenges with its advanced driver-assist systems like Autopilot and FSD, which are under heightened scrutiny and evolving regulatory frameworks globally. The enforcement mechanisms under the Act\u2014such as mandatory recalls and NHTSA oversight\u2014create a structured but costly compliance environment for traditional automakers like GM, while Tesla must navigate a more fragmented and rapidly changing global regulatory landscape, especially for autonomous technologies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GM \u2192 National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act: GM is subject to the Act, which imposes costly compliance requirements and mandates safety recalls if vehicles are non-compliant or contain defects.",
        "Hop 2: National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act \u2192 Vehicle Safety Standards: The Act regulates vehicles through the establishment of federal safety standards by NHTSA, which manufacturers must meet to sell vehicles in the U.S.",
        "Hop 3: Vehicle Safety Standards \u2190 TSLA: Tesla must meet Vehicle Safety Standards globally, which vary significantly from U.S. standards and require additional investment, especially for advanced driver-assist systems under evolving international regulations."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nIndustrial Environmental Control Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances, these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources.\n\nChemical  Regulations We continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations  to  maintain  compliance  and  evaluate  their  effect  on  our  business, suppliers and the automotive industry.\n\nGlobally, governments continue to introduce new legislation and regulations related to the selection and use of chemicals by mandating broad prohibitions or restrictions  and  implementing  vehicle  interior  air  quality,  green  chemistry,  life  cycle  analysis  and  product  stewardship  initiatives.  These  initiatives  give  broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers' responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicle's life, as well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing. G lobal treaties and initiatives such as the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm  Conventions  on  Chemicals  and  Waste,  the  Minamata  Convention  on  Mercury  and  EU  Registration,  Evaluation,  Authorization  and  Restriction  of Chemicals, are driving chemical regulations across signatory countries. Increases in the use of circuit boards and other electronics may require additional assessment under the Restriction of Hazardous Substances and Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment directives. New European requirements require suppliers of parts and vehicles to the European market to disclose substances of concern in parts.\n\nChemical regulations are increasing in North America. In the U.S., the EPA is moving forward with risk analysis and management of high priority chemicals under the authority of the 2016 Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. The EPA has also issued a per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) reporting rule that requires PFAS use reporting by manufacturers between 2011 and 2022. In addition, several U.S. states have chemical management regulations that can affect vehicle  design  and  manufacturing  such  as  chemical  restriction  and  use  requirements.  For  ex ample,  Minnesota  has  adopted  PFAS  reporting  and  elimination requirements beginning as early as 2026, except for unavoidable uses. Chemical restrictions and export controls in Canada continue to steadily progress under the Environment and Climate Change Canada's Chemical Management Plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic.\n\nThese emerging laws and regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity. Manufacturers, including joint venture partners and suppliers, that do not comply with global and specific country regulations could be subject to civil penalties, production disruptions or limitations on the sale of affected products. We believe we are materially in compliance with substantially all these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required dates.\n\n## Vehicle Safety\n\nU.S. Requirements The National Traffic and Motor V ehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the Safety Act) regulates the vehicles and items of motor vehicle equipment that we manufacture and sell. The Safety Act prohibits the sale in the U.S. of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding the many safety standards is costly as global compliance and non-governmental assessment requirements continue to evolve and grow more complex, and lack harmonization globally. The Safety Act further requires that if we or NHTSA determine a vehicle or an item of vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard, or that vehicle or equipment contains a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk, we must conduct a safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicles. Should we or NHTSA determine a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.\n\nOther National Requirements Outside of the U.S., many countries have established vehicle safety standards and regulations and are likely to adopt additional, more  stringent  requirements  in  the  future.  The  European  G eneral  Safety  Regulation  has  introduced  United  Nations  Economic  Commission  for  Europe  (UNECE) regulations, which are required for the European Type Approval process. G lobally, governments generally have been adopting UNECE based regulations with some variations to address local concerns. Any difference between North American and UNECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to vehicle development, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce complexity. Safety and recall requirements in various countries around the world, including in China, Brazil and G ulf Cooperation Council countries, also may add substantial costs and complexity to our safety and field action activities globally. In Canada, vehicle regulatory requirements are generally aligned with U.S. regulations; however, under the Canadian Motor V ehicle Safety Act, recall thresholds are different and the Minister of Transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or non-compliance when the Minister considers it to be in the interest of safety. Global regulations continue to increase in scope",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1. Business (Continued)\n\nSouth American countries are implementing stricter standards for v ehicle energy efficiency and sustainability as well. For example, in 2024, Brazil introduced its MOVER Program, which aims to significantly reduce carbon emissions from Brazil's automotiv e fleet through financial incentiv es for inv estments in sustainable technologies. In addition to setting stricter fuel economy targets starting in 2027, MOVER mandates new requirements for recyclability and GHG emission reporting.\n\nAs discussed above and below in Item 1A. Risk Factors under ' Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply w ith safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations,' in addition to the rates of EV growth, production disruptions, stop ships, supply chain limitations, lower-than-planned market acceptance of our v ehicles, and/or other circumstances may cause us to modify product plans or, in some cases, purchase credits in order to comply with emissions standards, fuel economy standards, or ZEV requirements.\n\n## Vehicle Safety\n\nU.S. Requirements. The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the 'Safety Act') regulates v ehicles and v ehicle equipment in two primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new v ehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable v ehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly and has continued to ev olv e as global compliance requirements and public domain (e.g., New Car Assessment Programs ('NCAPs'), Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ('IIHS'), and the China Insurance Auto Safety Index) ratings and assessments continue to ev olv e, are increasing in demands, and lack harmonization globally. As we expand our business priorities to include autonomous v ehicle technologies and broader mobility products and serv ices, our financial exposure has increased. Similarly, federal and state regulatory requirements are growing quickly as lawmakers and regulators adapt to adv ancements in automation, ranging from driv er-assistance technologies such as automatic braking to fully autonomous v ehicles. Autonomous v ehicle and driv er assist technologies continue to be scrutinized by the gov ernment, and actual or perceiv ed failures or misuse of these technologies and features hav e led to gov ernment inv estigations and inquiries, including of Ford, which has responded to information requests from NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board about our hands-free highway driv ing system, BlueCruise. Ford and other OEMs are required to report to NHTSA any crashes that meet NHTSA-defined criteria and occur when certain adv anced driv er assistance system features are in use. Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor v ehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated to recall v ehicles if it or NHTSA determines the v ehicles contain a non-compliance or a defect resulting in an unreasonable risk to safety. Should we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our v ehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.\n\nEuropean Requirements. The EU has established v ehicle safety standards and regulations and is likely to adopt additional or more stringent requirements in the future, especially in the areas of access to in-v ehicle data, artificial intelligence, and autonomous v ehicle technologies.\n\nThe European General Safety Regulation ('GSR') introduced UN-ECE regulations, which are required for the European Type Approv al process. The GSR includes the mandatory introduction of multiple activ e and passiv e safety features, including cybersecurity requirements for all registrations, which began in 2024. EU regulators are focusing on activ e safety features, such as lane departure warning systems, electronic stability control, and automatic brake assist. Electric v ehicle safety continues to be an activ e area of regulation in the EU, with UN-ECE Regulation No. 100 establishing safety requirements for EVs and mandating certain testing of electrical powertrains. Furthermore, mobile network prov iders in certain EU Member States hav e begun shutting down their 2G and 3G networks, which form the basis for e-Call system functionality in existing v ehicles. The e-Call systems in existing v ehicles may need to be updated as these systems are phased out. It is also possible that the EU may mandate Member States to maintain these networks to allow for the continued functionality of existing e-Call systems.\n\nOther National Requirements. Globally, gov ernments generally hav e been adopting UN-ECE based regulations with minor v ariations to address local concerns. Any difference between North American and UN-ECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to the dev elopment of global platform v ehicles, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce v ehicle design complexity while prov iding a common lev el of safety performance; we are seeking new opportunities in bilateral negotiations that can potentially contribute to this goal.",

New, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could also lead to increased costs of compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant, and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines. In addition, as we have increased our operations, we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government investigations, that we will need to defend against. If we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it may harm our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, business and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad. For example, in countries outside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different from equivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in all countries. This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements.\n\nIn particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation. We are continuing to develop our Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) technology. There are a variety of international, federal and state regulations that may apply to, and may adversely affect, the design and performance, sale, marketing, registration and operation of Autopilot and FSD (Supervised), and future capability, including autonomous vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. Such regulations, including their enforcement or the enforcement policy associated with the regulations, continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which could adversely affect our business.\n\nFinally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a supplier of electricity generated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a provider of grid services through virtual power plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning the import or export of components, electricity pricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-owned systems. If regulations and policies are introduced that adversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance or use of our solar and energy storage systems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and services, threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant jurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Any failure by us to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us.\n\nAny failure by us or our vendors or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or international privacy, data protection, artificial intelligence or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an unsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us. In addition, certain privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation, application and impact, and may require ex tensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union requiring certain data protection measures when handling, with a significant risk of fines for noncompliance. Similarly, our North American operations are subject to complex and changing federal and US state-specific data privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act which imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to California residents. Finally, additional privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in China, and other jurisdictions where Tesla has a market presence.\n\nThese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs and make enhancements to relevant data practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.",

In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions.

O ur m ost significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product C osts - N IKE 's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denom inated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain N I KE  entities purchase product from  the N T C , a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys N IKE  branded products from  third-party factories, predom inantly in U .S. Dollars. T he N T C , whose functional currency is the U .S. D ollar, then sells the products to N I KE  entities in their respective functional currencies. N T C  sales to a N I KE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the N T C .\n- b. Other N IKE  entities purchase product directly from  third-party factories predom inantly in U .S. D ollars. T hese purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE  entities with a functional currency other than the U .S. D ollar.\n\nI n both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U .S. D ollar reduces inventory costs incurred by N IKE  whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: N IKE  operates a foreign currency adjustm ent program  with certain factories. T he program  is designed to m ore effectively m anage foreign currency risk by assum ing certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, som e of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. U nder this program , our paym ents to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the labor, m aterials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of N IKE  branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denom inated.\n\nAs an offset to the im pacts of the fluctuating U .S. D ollar on our non-functional currency denom inated product purchases described above, a strengthening U .S. D ollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces N IKE 's U .S. D ollar inventory cost. C onversely, a weakening U .S. D ollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated E xternal Sales - A portion of our N IKE  Brand and C onverse revenues associated with E uropean operations are earned in currencies other than the E uro (e.g., the British P ound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the E uro as its functional currency. T hese sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other C osts - N on-functional currency denom inated costs, such as endorsem ent contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated M onetary Assets and Liabilities - O ur global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, prim arily receivables and payables, including intercom pany receivables and payables, denom inated in currencies other than their functional currencies. T hese balance sheet item s are subject to rem easurem ent which m ay create fluctuations in O ther (incom e) expense, net within our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are m anaged on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk m anagem ent program . W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and m ay also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the rem aining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denom inated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to m anage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denom inated m onetary assets and liabilities subject to rem easurem ent are not form ally designated as hedging instrum ents. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instrum ents are recognized in O ther (incom e) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency im pact of the rem easurem ent of the related non-functional currency denom inated asset or liability being hedged.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 45",

      "question": "How does Tesla's reliance on Panasonic Corporation for battery supply compare to GM's battery sourcing strategy, based on the documented agreements from 2011\u20132021?",
      "answer": "Tesla has a deeply structured and long-standing partnership with Panasonic Corporation for battery supply, evidenced by multiple agreements spanning from the original 2011 Supply Agreement (Exhibit 10.25\u2020) through multiple amendments and pricing agreements in 2019, 2020, and 2021 (Exhibits 10.35\u2020\u2020, 10.36\u2020\u2020, and 10.37\u2020\u2020). These agreements include detailed pricing terms, factory leases, and capacity commitments. In contrast, GM\u2019s 2023 filing references 'batteries' as a critical dependency but does not disclose specific suppliers, agreements, or timelines in the provided evidence, leaving the sourcing strategy opaque in comparison. This suggests Tesla\u2019s battery dependency is more formally contracted and supplier-concentrated, while GM\u2019s approach lacks disclosed detail in the evidence provided.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: TSLA \u2192 Panasonic Corporation: Tesla has a long-term, documented partnership with Panasonic Corporation, including a foundational 2011 supply agreement and multiple subsequent pricing and capacity agreements through 2021.",
        "Hop 2: Panasonic Corporation \u2192 Batteries: Panasonic is a key supplier of batteries to Tesla under these agreements, covering both Gigafactory 2170 cells and Japan-sourced cells.",
        "Hop 3: Batteries \u2190 GM: GM\u2019s 2023 filing references batteries as a critical component but does not disclose specific suppliers or agreements, indicating a lack of transparency or potentially a different sourcing model."

      "answer": "In their 2023 SEC filings, Panasonic Corporation has documented multiple battery supply agreements with Tesla, including the 2011 Supply Agreement, the 2020 Pricing Agreement (Gigafactory 2170 Cells), and the 2021 Pricing Agreement (Japan Cells), indicating a long-standing and evolving strategic partnership focused on scaling battery production for electric vehicles. In contrast, while General Motors (GM) mentions its dependency on batteries for electric vehicle production, no specific agreements with Panasonic are detailed in the provided evidence, suggesting GM's supply chain strategy may rely more on in-house development or other suppliers such as LG Chem or Samsung SDI.",

        "Hop 1: GM \u2192 Batteries: GM depends on batteries for its electric vehicle production, as stated in its 2023 10-K filing, but no specific supplier agreements are disclosed in the provided evidence.",

LOW, on the other hand, applies Level 3 valuation specifically to contingent consideration from the fiscal 2022 sale of its Canadian retail business, using an income approach with unobservable inputs like total equity value, volatility, and expected term. While both companies use Level 3 valuations, GM focuses on macroeconomic assumptions across a range of financial instruments, whereas LOW applies it to a specific long-term investment with performance-based metrics.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nFair Value Measurements A three-level valuation hierarchy, based upon observable and unobservable inputs, is used for fair value measurements. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 - Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable.\n\nMarketable Debt Securities We generally classify marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. V arious factors, including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value with non-credit related unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Noncredit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent non-binding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of ex it prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the finance receivables. For retail finance receivables, GM Financial uses static pool modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected remaining life of the finance receivables. The economic forecasts incorporate factors which vary by region that GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as forecasted auto industry conditions, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.  Net realizable value is the estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  less  cost  to  sell,  and  considers  general  market  and  economic  conditions,  periodic  reviews  of  current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Inventories are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete, with a primary focus on productive material, supplies, work in process and parts and accessories.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of typically two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on forecasted auction proceeds when there is a reliable basis to make such a determination. Realization of the residual values is dependent  on  the  future  ability  to  market  the  vehicles  under  prevailing  market  conditions.  The  estimate  of  the  residual  value  is  evaluated  over  the  life  of  the arrangement and adjustments may be made to the extent the expected value of the vehicle changes.",

      "question": "How does the impact of Illinois' Clean Energy Law on ComEd's transmission rate structure compare to Tesla's exposure to state-level regulatory challenges in markets with direct sales restrictions?",
      "answer": "Illinois' Clean Energy Law directly affects ComEd's transmission rate structure by requiring a new four-year multi-year plan to establish rates after the expiration of its performance-based distribution formula rate, and accelerating the amortization of ComEd's unprotected excess deferred income taxes over approximately 39.5 years. These regulatory changes introduce uncertainty around ComEd\u2019s rate of return on equity, which is currently set at 11.50% with a 50-basis-point incentive adder as a RTO member. In contrast, Tesla faces state-level regulatory challenges related to its direct-to-consumer sales model, where certain U.S. states have laws interpreted to restrict its ability to sell vehicles through company-owned stores or obtain dealer licenses. While ComEd\u2019s exposure centers on rate-setting mechanisms and compliance with decarbonization mandates, Tesla\u2019s risk is tied to legal interpretations of motor vehicle industry laws and potential legislative pushback from dealer associations.

On September 15, 2021, the Illinois Public Act 102-0662 was signed into law by the Governor of Illinois ('Clean Energy Law'). The Clean Energy Law includes, among other features, (1) procurement of CMCs from qualifying nuclear-powered generating facilities, (2) a requirement to file a general rate case or a new four-year multi-year plan no later than January 20, 2023 to establish rates effective after ComEd's existing performance-based distribution formula rate sunsets, (3)  an  extension  of  and  certain  adjustments  to  ComEd's  energy  efficiency  MWh  savings  goals,  (4)  revisions  to  the  Illinois  RPS requirements,  including  expanded  charges  for  the  procurement  of  RECs  from  wind  and  solar  generation,  (5)  a  requirement  to accelerate amortization of ComEd's unprotected excess deferred income taxes that ComEd was previously directed by the ICC to amortize using the average rate assumption method which equates to approximately 39.5 years, and (6) requirements that the ICC initiate  and  conduct  various  regulatory  proceedings  on  subjects  including  ethics,  spending,  grid  investments,  and  performance metrics. Regulatory or legal challenges regarding the validity or implementation of the Clean Energy Law are possible and Exelon and ComEd cannot reasonably predict the outcome of any such challenges.\n\n## Carbon Mitigation Credit\n\nThe  Clean  Energy  Law  establishes  decarbonization  requirements  for  Illinois  as  well  as  programs  to  support  the  retention  and development of emissions-free sources of electricity.

A major breach of our network security and systems may result in fines, penalties and damages and harm our brand, prospects and operating results.\n\n## We could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain governmental investigations and proceedings.\n\nWe are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.\n\nFor example, on October 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the Court on September 29, 2018, in connection with the actions taken by the SEC relating to Mr. Musk's statement on August 7, 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private. Pursuant to the settlement, we, among other things, paid a civil penalty of $20 million, appointed an independent director as the chair of our board of directors, appointed two additional independent directors to our board of directors and made further enhancements to our disclosure controls and other corporate governance-related matters. On April 26, 2019, this settlement was amended to clarify certain of the previously-agreed disclosure procedures, which was subsequently approved by the Court. All other terms of the prior settlement were reaffirmed without modification. Although we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement, if there is a lack of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance, additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings may be instituted against us.\n\n## We may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly.\n\nWhile we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, including sales through our website, we may not be able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales model. It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators, and such assertions persist. In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. The application of state laws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict.\n\nInternationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\n## The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.\n\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intra-day trading high of $1,243.49 per share and a low of $539.49 per share. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion of our common stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Public perception and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our shares, securities class action litigation has been filed against us. While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources.",

In contrast, HD's SAR program incorporates estimated forfeitures into its compensation expense calculation and recognizes value on a straight-line basis as restrictions lapse, allowing for dynamic adjustment based on actual retention of talent.

      "answer": "Nike's Class B common stock grants 10 votes per share, allowing certain shareholders greater influence over corporate decisions, as seen in its 2024 10-K filing. In contrast, Home Depot explicitly states that recipients of restricted stock units have no voting rights until the vesting of the award, which typically occurs up to five years after the grant date. This implies that Nike enables concentrated governance control through its dual-class structure, while Home Depot limits voting influence to fully vested shareholders, ensuring that only long-term stakeholders can directly impact corporate governance.",

O ur m ost significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product C osts - N IKE 's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denom inated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain N I KE  entities purchase product from  the N T C , a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys N IKE  branded products from  third-party factories, predom inantly in U .S. Dollars. T he N T C , whose functional currency is the U .S. D ollar, then sells the products to N I KE  entities in their respective functional currencies. N T C  sales to a N I KE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the N T C .\n- b. Other N IKE  entities purchase product directly from  third-party factories predom inantly in U .S. D ollars. T hese purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE  entities with a functional currency other than the U .S. D ollar.\n\nI n both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U .S. D ollar reduces inventory costs incurred by N IKE  whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: N IKE  operates a foreign currency adjustm ent program  with certain factories. T he program  is designed to m ore effectively m anage foreign currency risk by assum ing certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, som e of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. U nder this program , our paym ents to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the labor, m aterials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of N IKE  branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denom inated.\n\nAs an offset to the im pacts of the fluctuating U .S. D ollar on our non-functional currency denom inated product purchases described above, a strengthening U .S. D ollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces N IKE 's U .S. D ollar inventory cost. C onversely, a weakening U .S. D ollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated E xternal Sales - A portion of our N IKE  Brand and C onverse revenues associated with E uropean operations are earned in currencies other than the E uro (e.g., the British P ound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the E uro as its functional currency. T hese sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other C osts - N on-functional currency denom inated costs, such as endorsem ent contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated M onetary Assets and Liabilities - O ur global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, prim arily receivables and payables, including intercom pany receivables and payables, denom inated in currencies other than their functional currencies. T hese balance sheet item s are subject to rem easurem ent which m ay create fluctuations in O ther (incom e) expense, net within our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are m anaged on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk m anagem ent program . W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and m ay also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the rem aining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denom inated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to m anage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denom inated m onetary assets and liabilities subject to rem easurem ent are not form ally designated as hedging instrum ents. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instrum ents are recognized in O ther (incom e) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency im pact of the rem easurem ent of the related non-functional currency denom inated asset or liability being hedged.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 45",

The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions.

Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to be included in our consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate prov isions for income taxes hav e been determined for these entities. For unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, we are required to make an assertion regarding reinv estment or repatriation for tax purposes. For any earnings that we do not make a permanent reinv estment assertion, we recognize a prov ision for deferred income taxes. For earnings where we hav e made a permanent reinv estment assertion, no prov ision is recognized. See Note 6 for further discussion.\n\nWe are subject to global intangible low-taxed income tax, an incremental tax on foreign income. We hav e made an accounting election to record this tax in the period the tax arises.\n\n## Comprehensive Income\n\nComprehensive income includes net earnings adjusted for certain gains and losses that are excluded from net earnings and recognized within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of equity, which consists primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments. Accumulated other comprehensiv e loss also includes net losses on cash flow hedges that were immaterial as of February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024. Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensiv e loss into earnings were immaterial in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nAssets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Rev enues and expenses are translated using av erage exchange rates for the period, and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction. Cumulativ e foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensiv e loss as of February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024 were losses of $970 million and $365 million, respectiv ely.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nASU No. 2023-07. In Nov ember 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, 'Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improv ements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,' which is intended to improv e reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The disclosure requirements included in ASU No. 2023-07 are required for all public entities, including entities with a single reportable segment. ASU No. 2023-07 is effectiv e for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance is required to be applied on a retrospectiv e basis. We adopted ASU No. 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The adoption of this guidance resulted in additional financial statement disclosures and had no impact to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 2 which includes the disclosures resulting from our adoption of this guidance.\n\nASU No. 2022-04. In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations,' to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs used by an entity in connection with the purchase of goods and serv ices. The standard requires entities that use supplier finance programs to disclose the key terms of such programs, along with an annual rollforward of the related obligations, including the amount of obligations confirmed and the amounts paid during the period. ASU No. 2022-04 was effectiv e for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the required rollforward information, which was effectiv e for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We adopted ASU No. 2022-04 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, with the exception of the annual rollforward requirement, which was adopted on a prospectiv e basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The adoption of this guidance did not hav e an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n## Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nASU No. 2023-09. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 'Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improv ements to Income Tax Disclosures,' which requires disclosure of disaggregated information about a reporting entity's effectiv e tax rate reconciliation as well as disclosures on income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU No. 2023-09 is effectiv e for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance is required to be applied on a prospectiv e basis, with the option to apply the standard retrospectiv ely. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently ev aluating the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.",

      "answer": "McDonald's manages its foreign currency liabilities through option and forward contracts, with a total notional amount of $9.9 billion in foreign exchange cash flow hedges as of September 28, 2024. These contracts are used to offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of forecasted foreign currency transactions, assets, and liabilities, and are primarily focused on the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound, and Chinese yuan. Nike also utilizes option and forward contracts to hedge transactional exposures from product costs, external sales, and other costs denominated in non-functional currencies. While Nike does not specify a total notional amount, it emphasizes managing exposures on a portfolio basis using natural offsets and derivative instruments. Both companies rely on option contracts to mitigate foreign exchange risk, but McDonald's provides a concrete figure for its hedge exposure, whereas Nike focuses on the structural management of its foreign currency exposures through a combination of natural offsets and derivatives.",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

Product purchases denom inated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain N I KE  entities purchase product from  the N T C , a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys N IKE  branded products from  third-party factories, predom inantly in U .S. Dollars. T he N T C , whose functional currency is the U .S. D ollar, then sells the products to N I KE  entities in their respective functional currencies. N T C  sales to a N I KE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the N T C .\n- b. Other N IKE  entities purchase product directly from  third-party factories predom inantly in U .S. D ollars. T hese purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE  entities with a functional currency other than the U .S. D ollar.\n\nI n both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U .S. D ollar reduces inventory costs incurred by N IKE  whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: N IKE  operates a foreign currency adjustm ent program  with certain factories. T he program  is designed to m ore effectively m anage foreign currency risk by assum ing certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, som e of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. U nder this program , our paym ents to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the labor, m aterials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of N IKE  branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denom inated.\n\nAs an offset to the im pacts of the fluctuating U .S. D ollar on our non-functional currency denom inated product purchases described above, a strengthening U .S. D ollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces N IKE 's U .S. D ollar inventory cost. C onversely, a weakening U .S. D ollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated E xternal Sales - A portion of our N IKE  Brand and C onverse revenues associated with E uropean operations are earned in currencies other than the E uro (e.g., the British P ound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the E uro as its functional currency. T hese sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other C osts - N on-functional currency denom inated costs, such as endorsem ent contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated M onetary Assets and Liabilities - O ur global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, prim arily receivables and payables, including intercom pany receivables and payables, denom inated in currencies other than their functional currencies. T hese balance sheet item s are subject to rem easurem ent which m ay create fluctuations in O ther (incom e) expense, net within our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are m anaged on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk m anagem ent program . W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and m ay also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the rem aining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denom inated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to m anage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denom inated m onetary assets and liabilities subject to rem easurem ent are not form ally designated as hedging instrum ents. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instrum ents are recognized in O ther (incom e) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency im pact of the rem easurem ent of the related non-functional currency denom inated asset or liability being hedged.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 45",

      "question": "What specific pricing agreements and supply arrangements did Tesla and Panasonic Corporation formalize in their Gigafactory partnership, and how does GM\u2019s dependency on batteries compare in terms of supplier integration and contractual depth?",
      "answer": "Tesla and Panasonic Corporation formalized multiple pricing agreements and supply arrangements under their Gigafactory partnership, including the Amended and Restated General Terms and Conditions for Gigafactory (June 10, 2020), the 2020 Pricing Agreement (Gigafactory 2170 Cells), and the 2021 Pricing Agreement (Japan Cells). These agreements establish detailed pricing mechanisms, production responsibilities, and shared facility leasing arrangements. In contrast, GM\u2019s dependency on batteries is noted without equivalent supplier integration details or specific contractual commitments in the evidence provided, indicating a less transparent or structured supplier partnership compared to Tesla\u2019s explicit agreements with Panasonic.",

      "answer": "Lowe's utilizes Benchmark Securities' industry-standard pricing models that rely on observable inputs such as reported trades and broker-dealer quotes for Level 2 debt securities, ensuring consistent and market-based valuations. In contrast, Starbucks employs Level 3 valuation models for private equity instruments, which depend on unobservable inputs like management's assumptions and discounted cash flow estimates. This difference reflects Lowe's focus on market-validated pricing through Benchmark Securities versus Starbucks' more subjective, internally derived valuations for non-public assets.",

      "question": "How does GM's use of forecasted transactions in cash flow hedging compare to NKE's reliance on option contracts for managing foreign currency risk, particularly in terms of the deferred gains or losses impact on earnings?",
      "answer": "GM utilizes forecasted transactions as part of its cash flow hedging strategy, where changes in fair value are deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) and recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings, such as with foreign currency or interest rate swaps.

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

O ur m ost significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product C osts - N IKE 's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denom inated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain N I KE  entities purchase product from  the N T C , a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys N IKE  branded products from  third-party factories, predom inantly in U .S. Dollars. T he N T C , whose functional currency is the U .S. D ollar, then sells the products to N I KE  entities in their respective functional currencies. N T C  sales to a N I KE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the N T C .\n- b. Other N IKE  entities purchase product directly from  third-party factories predom inantly in U .S. D ollars. T hese purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE  entities with a functional currency other than the U .S. D ollar.\n\nI n both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U .S. D ollar reduces inventory costs incurred by N IKE  whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: N IKE  operates a foreign currency adjustm ent program  with certain factories. T he program  is designed to m ore effectively m anage foreign currency risk by assum ing certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, som e of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. U nder this program , our paym ents to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the labor, m aterials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of N IKE  branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denom inated.\n\nAs an offset to the im pacts of the fluctuating U .S. D ollar on our non-functional currency denom inated product purchases described above, a strengthening U .S. D ollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces N IKE 's U .S. D ollar inventory cost. C onversely, a weakening U .S. D ollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated E xternal Sales - A portion of our N IKE  Brand and C onverse revenues associated with E uropean operations are earned in currencies other than the E uro (e.g., the British P ound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the E uro as its functional currency. T hese sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other C osts - N on-functional currency denom inated costs, such as endorsem ent contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated M onetary Assets and Liabilities - O ur global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, prim arily receivables and payables, including intercom pany receivables and payables, denom inated in currencies other than their functional currencies. T hese balance sheet item s are subject to rem easurem ent which m ay create fluctuations in O ther (incom e) expense, net within our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are m anaged on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk m anagem ent program . W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and m ay also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the rem aining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denom inated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to m anage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denom inated m onetary assets and liabilities subject to rem easurem ent are not form ally designated as hedging instrum ents. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instrum ents are recognized in O ther (incom e) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency im pact of the rem easurem ent of the related non-functional currency denom inated asset or liability being hedged.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 45",

The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company's reportable segments can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, 'Segment Information and Geographic Data.'\n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "SBUX uses valuation models like Black Scholes and discounted cash flow models with unobservable inputs for private equity instruments, while LOW relies on broker/dealer quotes and other observable market inputs such as benchmark yields and issuer spreads for its Level 2 financial assets. Both companies apply industry-standard pricing models, but SBUX's Level 3 inputs reflect management estimates, whereas LOW emphasizes observable market data when quoted prices aren't available. This reflects differing approaches to fair value measurement despite shared use of valuation frameworks through Level 2 inputs like reported trades and benchmark securities.",

Fair Value (continued)\n\nRisk  margins  are  established  to  capture  the  non-capital  market  risks  of  the  instrument  which  represent  the  additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such actuarial assumptions as annuitization,  premium  persistency,  partial  withdrawal  and  surrenders.  The  establishment  of  risk  margins  requires  the  use  of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees. These guarantees may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to,  changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates; changes in nonperformance risk; and variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income.\n\nThe  Company  ceded  the  risk  associated  with  certain  of  the  GMIBs  previously  described.  These  reinsurance  agreements contain embedded derivatives which are included within premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses) or policyholder benefits and claims depending on  the  statement  of  operations  classification  of  the  direct  risk.  The  value  of  the  embedded  derivatives  on  the  ceded  risk  is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by the Company with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer.\n\nThe estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives within funds withheld related to certain ceded reinsurance is determined based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying assets held by the Company in a reference portfolio backing the funds  withheld  liability.  The  estimated  fair  value  of  the  underlying  assets  is  determined  as  described  in  '-  Investments -  Securities,  Short-term  Investments  and  Other  Investments.'  The  estimated  fair  value  of  these  embedded  derivatives  is included, along with their funds withheld hosts, in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in estimated fair  value  recorded  in  net  derivative  gains  (losses).  Changes  in  the  credit  spreads  on  the  underlying  assets,  interest  rates  and market  volatility  may  result  in  significant  fluctuations  in  the  estimated  fair  value  of  these  embedded  derivatives  that  could materially affect net income.\n\nThe Company issues certain annuity contracts which allow the policyholder to participate in returns from equity indices. These equity indexed features are embedded derivatives which are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host fixed annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). These embedded derivatives are classified within policyholder account balances on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe estimated fair value of the embedded equity indexed derivatives, based on the present value of future equity returns to the  policyholder  using  actuarial  and  present  value  assumptions  including  expectations  concerning  policyholder  behavior,  is calculated by the Company's actuarial department. The calculation is based on in-force business and uses standard capital market techniques, such as Black-Scholes, to calculate the value of the portion of the embedded derivative for which the terms are set. The portion of the embedded derivative covering the period beyond where terms are set is calculated as the present value of amounts expected to be spent to provide equity indexed returns in those periods. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes the establishment of a risk margin, as well as changes in nonperformance risk.\n\n## Embedded Derivatives Within Asset and Liability Host Contracts\n\n## Level 3 Valuation Approaches and Key Inputs:\n\nDirect and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits\n\nThese embedded derivatives are principally valued using the income approach. Valuations are based on option pricing techniques,  which  utilize  significant  inputs  that  may  include  swap  yield  curves,  currency  exchange  rates  and  implied volatilities. These embedded derivatives result in Level 3 classification because one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Significant unobservable inputs generally include: the extrapolation beyond observable limits of the swap yield curves and implied volatilities,  actuarial  assumptions  for  policyholder  behavior  and  mortality  and  the  potential  variability  in  policyholder behavior and mortality, nonperformance risk and cost of capital for purposes of calculating the risk margin.",

When quoted prices in active markets were available, investments were classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  When quoted prices in active markets were not available, fair values were determined using pricing models, and the inputs to those pricing models were based on observable market inputs.  The inputs to the pricing models were typically benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads and benchmark securities, among others.\n\n## Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\n\nFor the fiscal years ended January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, the Company had no material measurements of assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to their initial recognition.\n\n## Other Fair Value Disclosures\n\nThe Company's financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and long-term debt and are reflected in the financial statements at cost.  With the exception of long-term debt, cost approximates fair value for these items due to their short-term nature.  As further described in Note 9, certain long-term debt is associated with a fair value hedge, and the changes in fair value of the hedged debt is included in the carrying value of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of the Company's unsecured notes were estimated using quoted market prices.  The fair values of the Company's mortgage notes were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the future cash outflows associated with these arrangements and discounted using the applicable incremental borrowing rate.\n\nCarrying amounts and the related estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt, excluding finance lease obligations, are as follows:\n\n",

In contrast, Sojitz America holds all of Nike\u2019s redeemable preferred stock with a par value of $0.3 million, which does not carry general voting rights but does grant voting power as a separate class on major corporate actions such as asset sales or mergers. Additionally, Nike\u2019s preferred stock has a cumulative dividend of $0.10 per share annually, which must be paid in full before any dividends on common stock. This indicates that while both structures incorporate voting and dividend features, they serve different strategic purposes: Home Depot\u2019s is tied to employee compensation and retention, while Nike\u2019s is tied to a stakeholder with specific governance influence.",

      "question": "How do Tesla's multi-year pricing and leasing agreements with Panasonic for battery cells impact its cost predictability compared to GM's battery dependency, given Tesla's 2020 and 2021 pricing agreements and Panasonic's role as a key supplier?",
      "answer": "Tesla's structured, multi-year pricing agreements with Panasonic\u2014such as the 2020 Pricing Agreement for Gigafactory 2170 Cells and the 2021 Pricing Agreement for Japan Cells\u2014provide a degree of cost predictability by locking in pricing terms over extended periods. These agreements are supported by long-standing supply and operational agreements dating back to 2011 and reinforced through lease amendments for shared Gigafactory infrastructure. In contrast, GM's 10-K filing highlights a dependency on batteries as a critical cost driver without specifying similar long-term pricing arrangements with suppliers, suggesting a potentially higher exposure to battery price volatility. This contrast implies Tesla may have a more controlled cost structure for battery inputs, a key differentiator in financial planning and margin stability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: TSLA \u2192 Panasonic Corporation: Tesla has multiple long-term pricing agreements with Panasonic, including the 2020 and 2021 agreements, which help stabilize battery costs.",
        "Hop 2: Panasonic Corporation \u2192 Batteries: Panasonic is a key supplier of battery cells to Tesla under a long-standing supply relationship with detailed contractual terms and shared facility leases.",
        "Hop 3: Batteries \u2190 GM: GM identifies batteries as a critical cost component in its vehicles, indicating strategic supplier dependency without evidence of similar long-term pricing agreements."

      "question": "How does Nike's structure where holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board compare with Home Depot's approach to voting rights for restricted stock recipients, and what might this indicate about their respective approaches to shareholder influence in corporate governance decisions?",
      "answer": "Nike's governance structure grants holders of Class A Common Stock the ability to elect three-quarters of the Board of Directors, creating a concentrated voting power that could significantly influence corporate governance decisions. In contrast, Home Depot provides voting rights to recipients of restricted stock awards at the grant date, allowing these shareholders to participate in governance matters even before their shares fully vest. This difference suggests that Nike employs a more controlled governance model that prioritizes specific shareholder groups, while Home Depot extends broader voting participation to a wider set of equity holders, potentially fostering more distributed shareholder influence over time.",

        "Hop 1: NKE \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Nike's Class A Common Stock holders elect three-quarters of the Board of Directors, giving them outsized influence over governance decisions.",

        "Hop 3: Voting Rights \u2190 HD: Home Depot grants voting rights to recipients of restricted stock awards at the grant date, allowing them to vote unvested shares, which indicates broader shareholder participation in governance."

      "question": "How might changes in interest rate environments differently impact NIKE's fixed income portfolio and Booking Holdings' derivative positions, given their shared reliance on observable market inputs like interest rate yield curves?",
      "answer": "NIKE holds $11.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, primarily consisting of investment-grade fixed-income securities, which are exposed to interest rate risk. According to LMT's disclosures, fixed income investments are typically valued using pricing models that rely on observable market data such as interest rates and yield curves at commonly quoted intervals. Similarly, Booking Holdings discloses that its derivatives are valued using pricing models that incorporate interest rate yield curves, among other market inputs. Since both companies depend on these observable market inputs for valuation, shifts in interest rate environments could directly affect the fair value of NIKE\u2019s fixed income portfolio and BKNG\u2019s derivative instruments. NIKE\u2019s weighted average days to maturity of 65 days suggests some sensitivity to short-term rate changes, while Booking Holdings\u2019 short-term derivative contracts may experience more immediate mark-to-market volatility.",

        "Hop 1: NKE \u2192 Fixed Income Investments: NIKE holds $11.6 billion in short-term investments, primarily consisting of investment-grade fixed-income securities, which are exposed to interest rate risk.",

        "Hop 3: Pricing Models \u2190 BKNG: Booking Holdings uses pricing models for its derivative instruments that take into account interest rate yield curves and other observable market inputs, with valuations classified as Level 2 fair value measurements."

In contrast, NKE holds $11.6 billion in primarily investment-grade fixed income securities that are valued using pricing models with observable market data such as interest rates and yield curves, as these instruments are categorized as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.

      "answer": "Tesla reports no material impact from ASU 2022-02 because it adopted the standard prospectively on January 1, 2023, and the changes primarily affect entities with significant loan portfolios, such as financial institutions. In contrast, Capital One, which is a financial institution, implemented ASU 2022-02 and experienced meaningful operational changes, including the elimination of the 'concession' requirement for loan modifications and the redefinition of financial difficulty modifications (FDMs). These changes affected how Capital One assesses loan modifications and credit loss allowances, particularly in its Credit Card, Consumer Banking, and Commercial Banking businesses. McDonald's, while not directly affected by ASU 2022-02, complies with broader SEC disclosure requirements, which provide the regulatory context for how companies communicate such accounting changes. Therefore, Tesla's lack of material impact contrasts with Capital One's detailed implementation due to differences in business models and exposure to loan modification accounting.",

      "answer": "NKE holds $557 million in Level 2 derivatives, including foreign exchange forwards and options, which are valued using internal discounted cash flow models with observable inputs like interest rates and exchange rates. This indicates a focus on actively managed, market-sensitive instruments with transparent valuation methods. In contrast, SBUX applies discounted cash flow models primarily to Level 3 private equity instruments, which rely on unobservable inputs and management estimates, suggesting a more judgment-driven approach for less liquid or unique assets. The difference highlights NKE's emphasis on market-based hedging instruments and SBUX's use of valuation models for complex private investments.",

Counterparty credit risk, which is mitigated by master netting agreements and collateral posting arrangements with certain counterparties, had an impact on derivative fair value estimates that was not material. The Company's derivative financial instruments are discussed in Note 17.\n\nLevel 2 other liabilities are primarily arrangements that are valued based on the fair value of underlying investments, which are generally measured using Level 1 and Level 2 fair value techniques.\n\nLevel 2 borrowings, which include commercial paper, U.S. dollar denominated notes and certain foreign currency denominated borrowings, are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or identical instruments in markets that are not active.\n\nLevel 3 borrowings include the Asia Theme Park borrowings, which are valued based on the current borrowing cost and credit risk of the Asia Theme Parks as well as prevailing market interest rates.\n\nThe Company's financial instruments also include cash, cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate the fair values.\n\n## Non-recurring Fair Value Measure\n\nThe Company also has assets that may be required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are evaluated when certain triggering events occur (including a decrease in estimated future cash flows) that indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges as disclosed in Notes 4 and 18. Fair value was determined using estimated discounted future cash flows, which is a Level 3 valuation technique (see Note 2 for a discussion of the more significant inputs used in our discounted cash flow analysis).\n\n## Credit Concentrations\n\nThe Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments on an ongoing basis and does not currently anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\n\nThe Company does not expect that it would realize a material loss, based on the fair value of its derivative financial instruments as of September 28, 2024, in the event of nonperformance by any single derivative counterparty. The Company generally enters into derivative transactions only with counterparties that have a credit rating of A- or better and requires collateral in the event credit ratings fall below A- or aggregate ex posures ex ceed limits as defined by contract. In addition, the Company limits the amount of investment credit exposure with any one institution.\n\nThe Company does not have material cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that have below investment grade credit ratings and maintains short-term liquidity balances in high quality money market funds. At September 28, 2024, the Company's balances (excluding money market funds) with individual financial institutions that ex ceeded 10% of the Company's total cash and cash equivalents were 24% of total cash and cash equivalents. At September 30,",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nLevel 3: We determine the fair value of private equity instruments using valuation models, including Black Scholes' option pricing model and discounted cash flow models. Inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\n\nAssets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis may include items such as property, plant and equipment, ROU assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments, and other assets. We determine the fair value of these items using Level 3 inputs, as described in the related sections below.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nWe manage our exposure to various risks within our consolidated financial statements according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge interest rates, commodity prices, foreign currency-denominated revenue streams, inventory purchases, and assets, liabilities, and investments in certain foreign operations. In order to manage our ex posure to these risks, we use various types of derivative instruments including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars, and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of a purchased call option and a sold put option with equal premiums to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows, or to limit possible gains or losses on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to ex change cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets, and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nWe record all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and typically do not offset derivative assets and liabilities. Cash flows from derivative financial instruments and the related gains and losses are classified as cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments and cross-currency swaps, we generally do not enter into derivative instruments with maturities longer than three years. However, we are allowed to net settle transactions with respective counterparties for certain derivative contracts, inclusive of interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards, with a single, net amount payable by one party to the other. We also enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, cash collateral received under collateral security arrangements was $230.9 million and $77.1 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, cash collateral pledged as part of our commodity derivative margin requirements was $12.4 million and $20.6 million, respectively, and is included in prepaid ex penses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The potential effects of netting arrangements with our derivative contracts, excluding the effects of collateral, would not have had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets. We also hold cash and cash equivalents from various settled-to-market exchange traded futures related to coffee and dairy hedging.\n\nBy using these derivative instruments, we expose ourselves to potential credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with carefully selected, credit-worthy counterparties and distribute contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the derivative's gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive income ('OCI') and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') on our consolidated balance sheets. The gain or loss is subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings, in the same line item as the underlying hedged item on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nCash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the transactions are no longer likely to occur, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Net Investment Hedges\n\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the derivative's, or qualifying non-derivative instrument's, gain or loss is reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.",

New, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could also lead to increased costs of compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant, and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines. In addition, as we have increased our operations, we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government investigations, that we will need to defend against. If we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it may harm our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, business and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad. For example, in countries outside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different from equivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in all countries. This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements.\n\nIn particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation. We are continuing to develop our Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) technology. There are a variety of international, federal and state regulations that may apply to, and may adversely affect, the design and performance, sale, marketing, registration and operation of Autopilot and FSD (Supervised), and future capability, including autonomous vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. Such regulations, including their enforcement or the enforcement policy associated with the regulations, continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which could adversely affect our business.\n\nFinally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a supplier of electricity generated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a provider of grid services through virtual power plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning the import or export of components, electricity pricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-owned systems. If regulations and policies are introduced that adversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance or use of our solar and energy storage systems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and services, threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant jurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Any failure by us to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us.\n\nAny failure by us or our vendors or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or international privacy, data protection, artificial intelligence or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an unsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us. In addition, certain privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation, application and impact, and may require ex tensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union requiring certain data protection measures when handling, with a significant risk of fines for noncompliance. Similarly, our North American operations are subject to complex and changing federal and US state-specific data privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act which imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to California residents. Finally, additional privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in China, and other jurisdictions where Tesla has a market presence.\n\nThese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs and make enhancements to relevant data practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1. Business (Continued)\n\nSouth American countries are implementing stricter standards for v ehicle energy efficiency and sustainability as well. For example, in 2024, Brazil introduced its MOVER Program, which aims to significantly reduce carbon emissions from Brazil's automotiv e fleet through financial incentiv es for inv estments in sustainable technologies. In addition to setting stricter fuel economy targets starting in 2027, MOVER mandates new requirements for recyclability and GHG emission reporting.\n\nAs discussed above and below in Item 1A. Risk Factors under ' Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply w ith safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations,' in addition to the rates of EV growth, production disruptions, stop ships, supply chain limitations, lower-than-planned market acceptance of our v ehicles, and/or other circumstances may cause us to modify product plans or, in some cases, purchase credits in order to comply with emissions standards, fuel economy standards, or ZEV requirements.\n\n## Vehicle Safety\n\nU.S. Requirements. The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the 'Safety Act') regulates v ehicles and v ehicle equipment in two primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new v ehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable v ehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly and has continued to ev olv e as global compliance requirements and public domain (e.g., New Car Assessment Programs ('NCAPs'), Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ('IIHS'), and the China Insurance Auto Safety Index) ratings and assessments continue to ev olv e, are increasing in demands, and lack harmonization globally. As we expand our business priorities to include autonomous v ehicle technologies and broader mobility products and serv ices, our financial exposure has increased. Similarly, federal and state regulatory requirements are growing quickly as lawmakers and regulators adapt to adv ancements in automation, ranging from driv er-assistance technologies such as automatic braking to fully autonomous v ehicles. Autonomous v ehicle and driv er assist technologies continue to be scrutinized by the gov ernment, and actual or perceiv ed failures or misuse of these technologies and features hav e led to gov ernment inv estigations and inquiries, including of Ford, which has responded to information requests from NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board about our hands-free highway driv ing system, BlueCruise. Ford and other OEMs are required to report to NHTSA any crashes that meet NHTSA-defined criteria and occur when certain adv anced driv er assistance system features are in use. Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor v ehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated to recall v ehicles if it or NHTSA determines the v ehicles contain a non-compliance or a defect resulting in an unreasonable risk to safety. Should we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our v ehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.\n\nEuropean Requirements. The EU has established v ehicle safety standards and regulations and is likely to adopt additional or more stringent requirements in the future, especially in the areas of access to in-v ehicle data, artificial intelligence, and autonomous v ehicle technologies.\n\nThe European General Safety Regulation ('GSR') introduced UN-ECE regulations, which are required for the European Type Approv al process. The GSR includes the mandatory introduction of multiple activ e and passiv e safety features, including cybersecurity requirements for all registrations, which began in 2024. EU regulators are focusing on activ e safety features, such as lane departure warning systems, electronic stability control, and automatic brake assist. Electric v ehicle safety continues to be an activ e area of regulation in the EU, with UN-ECE Regulation No. 100 establishing safety requirements for EVs and mandating certain testing of electrical powertrains. Furthermore, mobile network prov iders in certain EU Member States hav e begun shutting down their 2G and 3G networks, which form the basis for e-Call system functionality in existing v ehicles. The e-Call systems in existing v ehicles may need to be updated as these systems are phased out. It is also possible that the EU may mandate Member States to maintain these networks to allow for the continued functionality of existing e-Call systems.\n\nOther National Requirements. Globally, gov ernments generally hav e been adopting UN-ECE based regulations with minor v ariations to address local concerns. Any difference between North American and UN-ECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to the dev elopment of global platform v ehicles, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce v ehicle design complexity while prov iding a common lev el of safety performance; we are seeking new opportunities in bilateral negotiations that can potentially contribute to this goal.",

Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances, these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources.\n\nChemical  Regulations We continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations  to  maintain  compliance  and  evaluate  their  effect  on  our  business, suppliers and the automotive industry.\n\nGlobally, governments continue to introduce new legislation and regulations related to the selection and use of chemicals by mandating broad prohibitions or restrictions  and  implementing  vehicle  interior  air  quality,  green  chemistry,  life  cycle  analysis  and  product  stewardship  initiatives.  These  initiatives  give  broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers' responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicle's life, as well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing. G lobal treaties and initiatives such as the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm  Conventions  on  Chemicals  and  Waste,  the  Minamata  Convention  on  Mercury  and  EU  Registration,  Evaluation,  Authorization  and  Restriction  of Chemicals, are driving chemical regulations across signatory countries. Increases in the use of circuit boards and other electronics may require additional assessment under the Restriction of Hazardous Substances and Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment directives. New European requirements require suppliers of parts and vehicles to the European market to disclose substances of concern in parts.\n\nChemical regulations are increasing in North America. In the U.S., the EPA is moving forward with risk analysis and management of high priority chemicals under the authority of the 2016 Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. The EPA has also issued a per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) reporting rule that requires PFAS use reporting by manufacturers between 2011 and 2022. In addition, several U.S. states have chemical management regulations that can affect vehicle  design  and  manufacturing  such  as  chemical  restriction  and  use  requirements.  For  ex ample,  Minnesota  has  adopted  PFAS  reporting  and  elimination requirements beginning as early as 2026, except for unavoidable uses. Chemical restrictions and export controls in Canada continue to steadily progress under the Environment and Climate Change Canada's Chemical Management Plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic.\n\nThese emerging laws and regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity. Manufacturers, including joint venture partners and suppliers, that do not comply with global and specific country regulations could be subject to civil penalties, production disruptions or limitations on the sale of affected products. We believe we are materially in compliance with substantially all these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required dates.\n\n## Vehicle Safety\n\nU.S. Requirements The National Traffic and Motor V ehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the Safety Act) regulates the vehicles and items of motor vehicle equipment that we manufacture and sell. The Safety Act prohibits the sale in the U.S. of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding the many safety standards is costly as global compliance and non-governmental assessment requirements continue to evolve and grow more complex, and lack harmonization globally. The Safety Act further requires that if we or NHTSA determine a vehicle or an item of vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard, or that vehicle or equipment contains a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk, we must conduct a safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicles. Should we or NHTSA determine a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.\n\nOther National Requirements Outside of the U.S., many countries have established vehicle safety standards and regulations and are likely to adopt additional, more  stringent  requirements  in  the  future.  The  European  G eneral  Safety  Regulation  has  introduced  United  Nations  Economic  Commission  for  Europe  (UNECE) regulations, which are required for the European Type Approval process. G lobally, governments generally have been adopting UNECE based regulations with some variations to address local concerns. Any difference between North American and UNECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to vehicle development, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce complexity. Safety and recall requirements in various countries around the world, including in China, Brazil and G ulf Cooperation Council countries, also may add substantial costs and complexity to our safety and field action activities globally. In Canada, vehicle regulatory requirements are generally aligned with U.S. regulations; however, under the Canadian Motor V ehicle Safety Act, recall thresholds are different and the Minister of Transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or non-compliance when the Minister considers it to be in the interest of safety. Global regulations continue to increase in scope",

In contrast, HD also accrues dividend equivalents on deferred shares for non-employee directors, but the payout is specifically tied to the vesting or payout date of the underlying shares, with additional accruals also applying to performance shares and restricted stock units, as detailed in their broader equity compensation disclosures.",

General Motors similarly relies on valuation models incorporating unobservable inputs for warranty reserves, with controls over significant assumptions like claims frequency and cost forecasts. Both companies' methodologies share exposure to model accuracy risks, though Lowe's faces additional complexity from its performance-based contingent consideration tied to Canadian retail business metrics, while GM's exposure centers on automotive market conditions affecting warranty claims.",

Significant factors used by the Company in estimating its liability for retail incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volumes, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. The Company's estimation model reflects the best estimate of the total incentive amount that the Company reasonably expects to pay at the time of sale.

      "answer": "LOW uses broker/dealer quotes as inputs to Level 2 fair value measurements for financial assets when quoted prices in active markets are not available, relying on third-party pricing models with observable market inputs like issuer spreads and benchmark securities. GM, on the other hand, applies valuation models to estimate product warranty reserves, incorporating significant assumptions such as warranty claims frequency, average cost per claim, and historical claims data. Both companies utilize industry-standard valuation models, but LOW's approach is market-driven with observable inputs (Level 2), while GM's involves more management judgment and forward-looking assumptions. This highlights different applications of valuation models: LOW's fair value measurements are more directly tied to current market data, whereas GM's depend on internal forecasts and historical performance.",

      "answer": "NKE actively uses option contracts as part of its foreign currency risk management program to hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions, non-functional currency denominated sales, and product cost exposures, with a notional amount of $9.9 billion in foreign exchange cash flow hedges as of September 28, 2024. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and help offset exchange rate fluctuations on inventory costs and revenues. In contrast, AMZN holds foreign currency assets such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and Japanese Yen in the form of cash equivalents and marketable securities, which are directly exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. A stronger U.S. Dollar can significantly reduce the translated value of these foreign currency assets. Therefore, while NKE mitigates its foreign exchange risk through structured hedging with option contracts, AMZN has more direct exposure to foreign currency assets without explicit mention of similar hedging mechanisms, leading to greater potential volatility in asset values.",

O ur m ost significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product C osts - N IKE 's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denom inated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain N I KE  entities purchase product from  the N T C , a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys N IKE  branded products from  third-party factories, predom inantly in U .S. Dollars. T he N T C , whose functional currency is the U .S. D ollar, then sells the products to N I KE  entities in their respective functional currencies. N T C  sales to a N I KE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the N T C .\n- b. Other N IKE  entities purchase product directly from  third-party factories predom inantly in U .S. D ollars. T hese purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE  entities with a functional currency other than the U .S. D ollar.\n\nI n both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U .S. D ollar reduces inventory costs incurred by N IKE  whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: N IKE  operates a foreign currency adjustm ent program  with certain factories. T he program  is designed to m ore effectively m anage foreign currency risk by assum ing certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, som e of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. U nder this program , our paym ents to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the labor, m aterials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of N IKE  branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denom inated.\n\nAs an offset to the im pacts of the fluctuating U .S. D ollar on our non-functional currency denom inated product purchases described above, a strengthening U .S. D ollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces N IKE 's U .S. D ollar inventory cost. C onversely, a weakening U .S. D ollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated E xternal Sales - A portion of our N IKE  Brand and C onverse revenues associated with E uropean operations are earned in currencies other than the E uro (e.g., the British P ound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the E uro as its functional currency. T hese sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other C osts - N on-functional currency denom inated costs, such as endorsem ent contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated M onetary Assets and Liabilities - O ur global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, prim arily receivables and payables, including intercom pany receivables and payables, denom inated in currencies other than their functional currencies. T hese balance sheet item s are subject to rem easurem ent which m ay create fluctuations in O ther (incom e) expense, net within our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are m anaged on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk m anagem ent program . W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and m ay also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the rem aining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denom inated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to m anage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denom inated m onetary assets and liabilities subject to rem easurem ent are not form ally designated as hedging instrum ents. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instrum ents are recognized in O ther (incom e) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency im pact of the rem easurem ent of the related non-functional currency denom inated asset or liability being hedged.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 45",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million. The following table summarizes the effect of foreign ex change cash flow hedges on AOCI:\n\n",

Actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the ex penditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.\n\nWe have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the ex penditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, our and our customers' development and use of artificial intelligence may result in increased claims of infringement or other claims, including those based on unauthorized use of third-party technology or content.\n\nOur digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.\n\n## We Have Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nThe results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign ex change rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from ex pectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and Japanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.\n\n## Operating Risks\n\n## Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\n\nWe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n\n## We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\n\nWe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.\n\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by, among other things, general economic, business, and geopolitical conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.\n\nOur sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following:\n\n- our ability to retain and increase sales to ex isting customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers' demands;\n- our ability to retain and ex pand our network of sellers;\n- our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;\n- the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;",

      "answer": "NIKE holds $11.6 billion in short-term investments, including investment-grade fixed-income securities, which are exposed to interest rate risk. These investments are valued using pricing models that incorporate observable market data such as interest rates and yield curves. Similarly, McDonald\u2019s discloses that its derivatives are valued using pricing models that rely on observable market parameters, including interest rate yield curves. While NIKE\u2019s risk stems from changes in interest rates affecting investment returns, McDonald\u2019s exposure is tied to derivative valuations that reflect market fluctuations. Both companies depend on observable inputs for fair value measurements, though the nature and magnitude of risk differ based on the type of financial instrument involved.",

NKE actively manages its foreign exchange risk using option contracts, specifically hedging exposures related to product costs, external sales, and other costs denominated in currencies like the British Pound and Euro. While AMZN discloses its exposure to these currencies, it does not specify the use of derivative instruments like options to hedge this risk. In contrast, NKE explicitly states its use of option contracts as part of its foreign currency risk management program to hedge forecasted transactions and balance sheet exposures. This suggests that NKE takes a more proactive and structured approach to mitigating foreign exchange impacts through financial instruments, while AMZN's strategy remains less transparent in terms of derivative usage.",

Actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the ex penditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.\n\nWe have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the ex penditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, our and our customers' development and use of artificial intelligence may result in increased claims of infringement or other claims, including those based on unauthorized use of third-party technology or content.\n\nOur digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.\n\n## We Have Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nThe results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign ex change rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from ex pectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and Japanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.\n\n## Operating Risks\n\n## Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\n\nWe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n\n## We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\n\nWe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.\n\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by, among other things, general economic, business, and geopolitical conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.\n\nOur sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following:\n\n- our ability to retain and increase sales to ex isting customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers' demands;\n- our ability to retain and ex pand our network of sellers;\n- our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;\n- the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;",

The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

O ur m ost significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product C osts - N IKE 's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denom inated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain N I KE  entities purchase product from  the N T C , a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys N IKE  branded products from  third-party factories, predom inantly in U .S. Dollars. T he N T C , whose functional currency is the U .S. D ollar, then sells the products to N I KE  entities in their respective functional currencies. N T C  sales to a N I KE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the N T C .\n- b. Other N IKE  entities purchase product directly from  third-party factories predom inantly in U .S. D ollars. T hese purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE  entities with a functional currency other than the U .S. D ollar.\n\nI n both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U .S. D ollar reduces inventory costs incurred by N IKE  whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: N IKE  operates a foreign currency adjustm ent program  with certain factories. T he program  is designed to m ore effectively m anage foreign currency risk by assum ing certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, som e of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. U nder this program , our paym ents to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the labor, m aterials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of N IKE  branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denom inated.\n\nAs an offset to the im pacts of the fluctuating U .S. D ollar on our non-functional currency denom inated product purchases described above, a strengthening U .S. D ollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces N IKE 's U .S. D ollar inventory cost. C onversely, a weakening U .S. D ollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated E xternal Sales - A portion of our N IKE  Brand and C onverse revenues associated with E uropean operations are earned in currencies other than the E uro (e.g., the British P ound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the E uro as its functional currency. T hese sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other C osts - N on-functional currency denom inated costs, such as endorsem ent contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated M onetary Assets and Liabilities - O ur global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, prim arily receivables and payables, including intercom pany receivables and payables, denom inated in currencies other than their functional currencies. T hese balance sheet item s are subject to rem easurem ent which m ay create fluctuations in O ther (incom e) expense, net within our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are m anaged on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk m anagem ent program . W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and m ay also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the rem aining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denom inated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to m anage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denom inated m onetary assets and liabilities subject to rem easurem ent are not form ally designated as hedging instrum ents. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instrum ents are recognized in O ther (incom e) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency im pact of the rem easurem ent of the related non-functional currency denom inated asset or liability being hedged.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 45",

Dividends paid on unvested shares were immaterial for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019. Additionally, the majority of our restricted stock awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service.\n\nWe have also granted performance share awards under the Plans. These awards provide for the issuance of shares of our common stock at the end of the three-year performance cycle based upon our performance against target average ROIC and operating profit over that performance cycle. Additionally, the awards become non-forfeitable upon the associate's attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service and minimum performance targets are achieved. Recipients of performance share awards have no voting rights until the shares are issued following completion of the performance period. Dividend equivalents accrue on the performance shares (as reinvested shares) and are paid upon the payout of the award based upon the actual number of shares earned.\n\nThe fair value of the restricted stock and performance shares is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse.\n\nRestricted Stock Units. Each restricted stock unit entitles the associate to one share of common stock to be received upon vesting up to five years after the grant date.

      "question": "How does McDonald's revenue model relying on affiliates compare to General Motors' production strategy for crossovers through nonconsolidated affiliates, particularly in terms of revenue contribution and operational structure?",
      "answer": "McDonald's generates revenue from affiliates through royalty payments based on a percentage of sales, along with initial fees, as part of its franchise model. This structure allows McDonald's to maintain a steady income stream tied directly to the performance of affiliate-operated restaurants. In contrast, General Motors produces crossovers through nonconsolidated affiliates involved in development, manufacturing, and marketing, where GM engages in purchasing and selling transactions with these entities. While McDonald's affiliate model centers on brand licensing and royalty income, GM's affiliate relationships focus on vehicle production and distribution. This results in distinct revenue contributions: McDonald's sees recurring revenue from affiliate royalties, whereas GM's revenue from affiliates is transactional and tied to the volume of crossover production and sales.",

The pronouncement expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted the new standard in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Refer to the Segment footnote on page 52 of this Form 10-K for the enhanced disclosures added as a result of the adoption of A SU 2023-07.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" (\"ASU 2023-09\"). The pronouncement expands the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. A SU 2023-09 is effectiv e for fiscal y ears beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that A SU 2023-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## Disaggregation - Income Statement Expenses\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, \"Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\" (\"ASU 2024-03\"). The pronouncement expands the disclosure requirements for expenses, specifically by providing more detailed information about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. A SU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that A SU 2024-03 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company's Other revenues are primarily comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the M cDonald's brand and thirdparty revenues for the Dynamic Y ield business, for periods prior to its sale on A pril 1, 2022.\n\nSales by Company-owned and operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Initial fees are recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years.\n\nThe Company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees that are distinct from the franchise agreement because they do not require integration with other goods or services that the Company provides. The Company has determined that it is the principal in these arrangements. Accordingly, the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These revenues are recognized as the goods or services are transferred to the franchisee, and related expenses are recognized as incurred, primarily within Other restaurant expenses. There may be a timing difference between the costs the Company incurs and the related fees the Company receives from franchisees, but the various technology platform fees are not designed to generate margins for the Company. Brand licensing arrangement revenues are based on a percent of sales and are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. For periods prior to A pril 1, 2022, Dynamic Y ield third party revenues were generated from providing software as a service solutions to customers and were recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service was performed.\n\n## PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings-up to 40 years; leasehold improvements-the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include certain option periods; and equipment-3 to 12 years.\n\nThe Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.\n\nThe Company may share in the cost of certain restaurant improvements with its franchisees. Since M cDonald's generally manages the project and provides up front funding in these instances, during the project the Company estimates which costs are the responsibility of M cDonald's and which are the responsibility of the franchisee, and allocates the corresponding costs between Property and equipment and Accounts receivable. Upon the completion of the project, the allocation of costs is finaliz ed and may result in immaterial adjustments to the balances and associated depreciation expense.\n\nRefer to the Property and Equipment footnote on page 54 of this Form 10-K for additional information.",

Segment Reporting\n\nOur chief operating decision-maker, who is our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, analyzes the results of our business through the following reportable segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and Cruise through EBIT-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates GM Financial through EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are an integral part of its operational and financial performance. These financial metrics are used to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions and to monitor budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis. To manage operations and make decisions regarding resource allocations, our chief operating decision-maker is regularly provided and reviews expense information at a consolidated, functional level for our global purchasing and supply chain, manufacturing and engineering functions. Warranty and quality metrics are also viewed on a consolidated basis. Currently, a focus is being placed on driving an efficient, consolidated fixed cost structure and managing overall global headcount. V ehiclelevel profitability metrics are also reviewed during the planning stage and throughout a program's life cycle on a forecasted basis, and not on an actual basis. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategic initiatives.\n\nSubstantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.\n\nGMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily  China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the  Baojun,  Buick,  Cadillac,  Chevrolet and  Wuling brands.  Cruise  is  our  global  segment  responsible  for  the  development  of  AV   technology,  and  includes  AV -related  engineering  and  other  costs.  We  provide automotive financing services through our GM Financial segment.\n\nOur automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/V auxhall Business (primarily pension costs), corporate expenditures and certain revenues and expenses that are not part of a reportable segment are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and intersegment balances. All intersegment balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.",

      "answer": "LOW relies on broker-dealer quotes as part of its Level 2 fair value determinations for financial assets and liabilities, using observable market inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, and benchmark securities when quoted prices in active markets are not available. In contrast, SBUX applies Level 3 valuation models with unobservable inputs\u2014such as Black Scholes' option pricing model and discounted cash flow models\u2014to determine the fair value of private equity instruments and nonrecurring assets like property, plant, and equipment or goodwill. This indicates that LOW leans more heavily on external market data through broker-dealer inputs, while SBUX depends more on internally derived assumptions and models for fair value estimation.",

      "answer": "NKE's Class B Common Stockholders have limited voting rights, only participating on certain defined matters such as exiting the core payments business or major corporate transactions, and do not influence the election of the Board of Directors, which is controlled by Class A Common Stockholders. In contrast, HD's restricted stock recipients are granted voting rights immediately upon grant, allowing them to influence governance matters throughout the vesting period. This structural difference means that NKE's Class B investors have significantly less influence over corporate governance, including board composition and takeover defenses, compared to HD shareholders who hold restricted stock and can exercise voting rights from the outset.",

        "Hop 1: NKE \u2192 Class B Common Stock: NKE's Class B Common Stockholders have no voting rights except on specific matters such as exiting the core payments business or major corporate transactions.",

      "answer": "NKE actively uses option contracts as part of its foreign currency risk management program to hedge transactional exposures from product costs, external sales, and other liabilities, with these contracts intended to offset exchange rate fluctuations. These instruments directly impact foreign currency liabilities, as stated in the evidence showing how gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of related liabilities. Meanwhile, MCD reports its foreign currency net asset exposure (foreign currency assets less liabilities) as a key metric, indicating a different approach focused on net positions rather than direct hedging through options. Therefore, while NKE mitigates liabilities risk using options, MCD's strategy appears more focused on managing the overall net exposure balance.",

O ur m ost significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product C osts - N IKE 's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denom inated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain N I KE  entities purchase product from  the N T C , a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys N IKE  branded products from  third-party factories, predom inantly in U .S. Dollars. T he N T C , whose functional currency is the U .S. D ollar, then sells the products to N I KE  entities in their respective functional currencies. N T C  sales to a N I KE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the N T C .\n- b. Other N IKE  entities purchase product directly from  third-party factories predom inantly in U .S. D ollars. T hese purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE  entities with a functional currency other than the U .S. D ollar.\n\nI n both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U .S. D ollar reduces inventory costs incurred by N IKE  whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: N IKE  operates a foreign currency adjustm ent program  with certain factories. T he program  is designed to m ore effectively m anage foreign currency risk by assum ing certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, som e of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. U nder this program , our paym ents to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the labor, m aterials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of N IKE  branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denom inated.\n\nAs an offset to the im pacts of the fluctuating U .S. D ollar on our non-functional currency denom inated product purchases described above, a strengthening U .S. D ollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces N IKE 's U .S. D ollar inventory cost. C onversely, a weakening U .S. D ollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated E xternal Sales - A portion of our N IKE  Brand and C onverse revenues associated with E uropean operations are earned in currencies other than the E uro (e.g., the British P ound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the E uro as its functional currency. T hese sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other C osts - N on-functional currency denom inated costs, such as endorsem ent contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated M onetary Assets and Liabilities - O ur global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, prim arily receivables and payables, including intercom pany receivables and payables, denom inated in currencies other than their functional currencies. T hese balance sheet item s are subject to rem easurem ent which m ay create fluctuations in O ther (incom e) expense, net within our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are m anaged on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk m anagem ent program . W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and m ay also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the rem aining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denom inated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to m anage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denom inated m onetary assets and liabilities subject to rem easurem ent are not form ally designated as hedging instrum ents. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instrum ents are recognized in O ther (incom e) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency im pact of the rem easurem ent of the related non-functional currency denom inated asset or liability being hedged.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 45",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

      "question": "How does McDonald's (MCD) reliance on its affiliates for brand licensing revenue compare to General Motors' (GM) use of nonconsolidated affiliates in the automobile parts sector, particularly in terms of how each company integrates these affiliate relationships into its broader revenue or production strategy?",
      "answer": "McDonald's generates brand licensing revenues from its affiliates, recognizing them based on a percent of sales at the time of the underlying sale, as stated in its 2024 10-K. This reflects a strategy where affiliates contribute to brand monetization through consumer packaged goods. In contrast, General Motors engages with nonconsolidated affiliates for the development, production, and marketing of automobile parts and vehicles, as noted in GM's 2024 10-K. GM\u2019s affiliate relationships are operational in nature, directly tied to manufacturing and supply chain activities. The integration of these relationships differs significantly: MCD treats affiliate licensing as a revenue stream tied to brand strength, while GM relies on affiliates for cost-sharing and production support in the automotive supply chain.",

The pronouncement expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted the new standard in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Refer to the Segment footnote on page 52 of this Form 10-K for the enhanced disclosures added as a result of the adoption of A SU 2023-07.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" (\"ASU 2023-09\"). The pronouncement expands the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. A SU 2023-09 is effectiv e for fiscal y ears beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that A SU 2023-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## Disaggregation - Income Statement Expenses\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, \"Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\" (\"ASU 2024-03\"). The pronouncement expands the disclosure requirements for expenses, specifically by providing more detailed information about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. A SU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that A SU 2024-03 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company's Other revenues are primarily comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the M cDonald's brand and thirdparty revenues for the Dynamic Y ield business, for periods prior to its sale on A pril 1, 2022.\n\nSales by Company-owned and operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Initial fees are recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years.\n\nThe Company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees that are distinct from the franchise agreement because they do not require integration with other goods or services that the Company provides. The Company has determined that it is the principal in these arrangements. Accordingly, the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These revenues are recognized as the goods or services are transferred to the franchisee, and related expenses are recognized as incurred, primarily within Other restaurant expenses. There may be a timing difference between the costs the Company incurs and the related fees the Company receives from franchisees, but the various technology platform fees are not designed to generate margins for the Company. Brand licensing arrangement revenues are based on a percent of sales and are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. For periods prior to A pril 1, 2022, Dynamic Y ield third party revenues were generated from providing software as a service solutions to customers and were recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service was performed.\n\n## PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings-up to 40 years; leasehold improvements-the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include certain option periods; and equipment-3 to 12 years.\n\nThe Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.\n\nThe Company may share in the cost of certain restaurant improvements with its franchisees. Since M cDonald's generally manages the project and provides up front funding in these instances, during the project the Company estimates which costs are the responsibility of M cDonald's and which are the responsibility of the franchisee, and allocates the corresponding costs between Property and equipment and Accounts receivable. Upon the completion of the project, the allocation of costs is finaliz ed and may result in immaterial adjustments to the balances and associated depreciation expense.\n\nRefer to the Property and Equipment footnote on page 54 of this Form 10-K for additional information.",

Segment Reporting\n\nOur chief operating decision-maker, who is our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, analyzes the results of our business through the following reportable segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and Cruise through EBIT-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates GM Financial through EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are an integral part of its operational and financial performance. These financial metrics are used to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions and to monitor budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis. To manage operations and make decisions regarding resource allocations, our chief operating decision-maker is regularly provided and reviews expense information at a consolidated, functional level for our global purchasing and supply chain, manufacturing and engineering functions. Warranty and quality metrics are also viewed on a consolidated basis. Currently, a focus is being placed on driving an efficient, consolidated fixed cost structure and managing overall global headcount. V ehiclelevel profitability metrics are also reviewed during the planning stage and throughout a program's life cycle on a forecasted basis, and not on an actual basis. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategic initiatives.\n\nSubstantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.\n\nGMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily  China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the  Baojun,  Buick,  Cadillac,  Chevrolet and  Wuling brands.  Cruise  is  our  global  segment  responsible  for  the  development  of  AV   technology,  and  includes  AV -related  engineering  and  other  costs.  We  provide automotive financing services through our GM Financial segment.\n\nOur automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/V auxhall Business (primarily pension costs), corporate expenditures and certain revenues and expenses that are not part of a reportable segment are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and intersegment balances. All intersegment balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.",

Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

In contrast, Lowe\u2019s provides deferred stock units to non-employee directors that also earn dividend equivalents, but these awards vest either on the first anniversary of the grant date or the day before the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders, with expense recognition over the service period.

To mitigate associated risks, MCD uses option and forward contracts to hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions, with $9.9 billion in notional amounts of net foreign exchange cash flow hedges as of September 28, 2024 (chunk_2). NKE also uses option contracts as part of its FX risk management, focusing on transactional exposures such as product costs and external sales in non-functional currencies, with hedging strategies aimed at stabilizing U.S. Dollar inventory costs amid FX fluctuations (chunk_3). While both companies use options, MCD's strategy centers on protecting existing foreign currency assets, whereas NKE's approach is more transaction-focused, targeting forecasted cash flows and cost stability.",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

O ur m ost significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n\n- Product C osts - N IKE 's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1. Product purchases denom inated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\n- a. Certain N I KE  entities purchase product from  the N T C , a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys N IKE  branded products from  third-party factories, predom inantly in U .S. Dollars. T he N T C , whose functional currency is the U .S. D ollar, then sells the products to N I KE  entities in their respective functional currencies. N T C  sales to a N I KE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the N T C .\n- b. Other N IKE  entities purchase product directly from  third-party factories predom inantly in U .S. D ollars. T hese purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE  entities with a functional currency other than the U .S. D ollar.\n\nI n both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U .S. D ollar reduces inventory costs incurred by N IKE  whereas a stronger U .S. D ollar increases its cost.\n\n2. Factory input costs: N IKE  operates a foreign currency adjustm ent program  with certain factories. T he program  is designed to m ore effectively m anage foreign currency risk by assum ing certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, som e of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. U nder this program , our paym ents to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the labor, m aterials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of N IKE  branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denom inated.\n\nAs an offset to the im pacts of the fluctuating U .S. D ollar on our non-functional currency denom inated product purchases described above, a strengthening U .S. D ollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces N IKE 's U .S. D ollar inventory cost. C onversely, a weakening U .S. D ollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated E xternal Sales - A portion of our N IKE  Brand and C onverse revenues associated with E uropean operations are earned in currencies other than the E uro (e.g., the British P ound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the E uro as its functional currency. T hese sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n- Other C osts - N on-functional currency denom inated costs, such as endorsem ent contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.\n- Non-Functional C urrency D enom inated M onetary Assets and Liabilities - O ur global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, prim arily receivables and payables, including intercom pany receivables and payables, denom inated in currencies other than their functional currencies. T hese balance sheet item s are subject to rem easurem ent which m ay create fluctuations in O ther (incom e) expense, net within our C onsolidated Statem ents of Incom e.\n\n## MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\n\nTransactional exposures are m anaged on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk m anagem ent program . W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and m ay also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the rem aining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denom inated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\nCertain currency forward contracts used to m anage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denom inated m onetary assets and liabilities subject to rem easurem ent are not form ally designated as hedging instrum ents. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instrum ents are recognized in O ther (incom e) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency im pact of the rem easurem ent of the related non-functional currency denom inated asset or liability being hedged.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 45",

Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to be included in our consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate prov isions for income taxes hav e been determined for these entities. For unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, we are required to make an assertion regarding reinv estment or repatriation for tax purposes. For any earnings that we do not make a permanent reinv estment assertion, we recognize a prov ision for deferred income taxes. For earnings where we hav e made a permanent reinv estment assertion, no prov ision is recognized. See Note 6 for further discussion.\n\nWe are subject to global intangible low-taxed income tax, an incremental tax on foreign income. We hav e made an accounting election to record this tax in the period the tax arises.\n\n## Comprehensive Income\n\nComprehensive income includes net earnings adjusted for certain gains and losses that are excluded from net earnings and recognized within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of equity, which consists primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments. Accumulated other comprehensiv e loss also includes net losses on cash flow hedges that were immaterial as of February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024. Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensiv e loss into earnings were immaterial in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nAssets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Rev enues and expenses are translated using av erage exchange rates for the period, and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction. Cumulativ e foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensiv e loss as of February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024 were losses of $970 million and $365 million, respectiv ely.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nASU No. 2023-07. In Nov ember 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, 'Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improv ements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,' which is intended to improv e reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The disclosure requirements included in ASU No. 2023-07 are required for all public entities, including entities with a single reportable segment. ASU No. 2023-07 is effectiv e for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance is required to be applied on a retrospectiv e basis. We adopted ASU No. 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The adoption of this guidance resulted in additional financial statement disclosures and had no impact to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 2 which includes the disclosures resulting from our adoption of this guidance.\n\nASU No. 2022-04. In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations,' to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs used by an entity in connection with the purchase of goods and serv ices. The standard requires entities that use supplier finance programs to disclose the key terms of such programs, along with an annual rollforward of the related obligations, including the amount of obligations confirmed and the amounts paid during the period. ASU No. 2022-04 was effectiv e for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the required rollforward information, which was effectiv e for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We adopted ASU No. 2022-04 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, with the exception of the annual rollforward requirement, which was adopted on a prospectiv e basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The adoption of this guidance did not hav e an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n## Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nASU No. 2023-09. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 'Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improv ements to Income Tax Disclosures,' which requires disclosure of disaggregated information about a reporting entity's effectiv e tax rate reconciliation as well as disclosures on income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU No. 2023-09 is effectiv e for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance is required to be applied on a prospectiv e basis, with the option to apply the standard retrospectiv ely. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently ev aluating the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.",

      "answer": "HD issues additional shares as dividend equivalents to non-employee directors upon the payout of deferred shares following termination of service, based on accrued dividends. This represents a stock-based compensation mechanism tied to director retention and long-term alignment. In contrast, LOW receives additional shares from third-party financial institutions as part of variable notional ASR agreements, which are tied to repurchase efficiency and final notional value calculations. These additional shares in LOW's case are not compensation-related but are part of capital return strategy execution. Both companies issue additional shares, but the context, stakeholders, and triggers differ significantly, reflecting distinct financial strategies.",

      "answer": "Amazon reported $20.6 billion, $20.3 billion, and $21.4 billion in advertising and promotional costs (including affiliate commissions) in 2022, 2023, and 2024 respectively, which are expensed as incurred to drive customer referrals and sales. In contrast, GM engages in procurement transactions with nonconsolidated affiliates involved in automobile parts production, though specific dollar amounts aren't disclosed, indicating these relationships are operationally focused on component part purchases rather than marketing expenditures. While both companies engage with 'affiliates' in their financial reporting, Amazon treats these relationships as sales and marketing expenses while GM frames them as supply chain procurement activities, revealing fundamentally different commercial applications of affiliate relationships.",

Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations.\n\n## Technology and Infrastructure\n\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. Technology and infrastructure costs are generally expensed as incurred.\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties.\n\nAdvertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $20.6 billion, $20.3 billion, and $21.4 billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\n## General and Administrative\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nCompensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. Under this method, approximately 50% of the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the first year of grant for the majority of our stock-based compensation awards. The accelerated method also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures. If an award is forfeited early in its life, the adjustment to compensation ex pense is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience. Additionally, we have stock-based compensation awards that are expected to settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or ex piration.\n\n## Other Operating Expense (Income), Net\n\nOther operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets and asset impairments.",

Segment Reporting\n\nOur chief operating decision-maker, who is our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, analyzes the results of our business through the following reportable segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and Cruise through EBIT-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates GM Financial through EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are an integral part of its operational and financial performance. These financial metrics are used to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions and to monitor budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis. To manage operations and make decisions regarding resource allocations, our chief operating decision-maker is regularly provided and reviews expense information at a consolidated, functional level for our global purchasing and supply chain, manufacturing and engineering functions. Warranty and quality metrics are also viewed on a consolidated basis. Currently, a focus is being placed on driving an efficient, consolidated fixed cost structure and managing overall global headcount. V ehiclelevel profitability metrics are also reviewed during the planning stage and throughout a program's life cycle on a forecasted basis, and not on an actual basis. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategic initiatives.\n\nSubstantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.\n\nGMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily  China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the  Baojun,  Buick,  Cadillac,  Chevrolet and  Wuling brands.  Cruise  is  our  global  segment  responsible  for  the  development  of  AV   technology,  and  includes  AV -related  engineering  and  other  costs.  We  provide automotive financing services through our GM Financial segment.\n\nOur automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/V auxhall Business (primarily pension costs), corporate expenditures and certain revenues and expenses that are not part of a reportable segment are recorded centrally in Corporate.

      "answer": "Nike discloses only the existence and balance of embedded derivatives ($5 million in 2022) without detailing specific valuation methodologies. In contrast, MetLife explicitly describes using the income approach for valuing embedded derivatives tied to guaranteed minimum benefits, with significant unobservable inputs including extrapolated swap yield curves, actuarial assumptions for policyholder behavior and mortality, and risk margins based on cost of capital. MetLife also notes that these Level 3 classifications arise because inputs are not fully observable, requiring significant management judgment.

When quoted prices in active markets were not available, fair values were determined using pricing models, and the inputs to those pricing models were based on observable market inputs.

Fair Value (continued)\n\nRisk  margins  are  established  to  capture  the  non-capital  market  risks  of  the  instrument  which  represent  the  additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such actuarial assumptions as annuitization,  premium  persistency,  partial  withdrawal  and  surrenders.  The  establishment  of  risk  margins  requires  the  use  of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees. These guarantees may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to,  changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates; changes in nonperformance risk; and variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income.\n\nThe  Company  ceded  the  risk  associated  with  certain  of  the  GMIBs  previously  described.  These  reinsurance  agreements contain embedded derivatives which are included within premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses) or policyholder benefits and claims depending on  the  statement  of  operations  classification  of  the  direct  risk.  The  value  of  the  embedded  derivatives  on  the  ceded  risk  is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by the Company with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer.\n\nThe estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives within funds withheld related to certain ceded reinsurance is determined based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying assets held by the Company in a reference portfolio backing the funds  withheld  liability.  The  estimated  fair  value  of  the  underlying  assets  is  determined  as  described  in  '-  Investments -  Securities,  Short-term  Investments  and  Other  Investments.'  The  estimated  fair  value  of  these  embedded  derivatives  is included, along with their funds withheld hosts, in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in estimated fair  value  recorded  in  net  derivative  gains  (losses).  Changes  in  the  credit  spreads  on  the  underlying  assets,  interest  rates  and market  volatility  may  result  in  significant  fluctuations  in  the  estimated  fair  value  of  these  embedded  derivatives  that  could materially affect net income.\n\nThe Company issues certain annuity contracts which allow the policyholder to participate in returns from equity indices. These equity indexed features are embedded derivatives which are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host fixed annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). These embedded derivatives are classified within policyholder account balances on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe estimated fair value of the embedded equity indexed derivatives, based on the present value of future equity returns to the  policyholder  using  actuarial  and  present  value  assumptions  including  expectations  concerning  policyholder  behavior,  is calculated by the Company's actuarial department. The calculation is based on in-force business and uses standard capital market techniques, such as Black-Scholes, to calculate the value of the portion of the embedded derivative for which the terms are set. The portion of the embedded derivative covering the period beyond where terms are set is calculated as the present value of amounts expected to be spent to provide equity indexed returns in those periods. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes the establishment of a risk margin, as well as changes in nonperformance risk.\n\n## Embedded Derivatives Within Asset and Liability Host Contracts\n\n## Level 3 Valuation Approaches and Key Inputs:\n\nDirect and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits\n\nThese embedded derivatives are principally valued using the income approach. Valuations are based on option pricing techniques,  which  utilize  significant  inputs  that  may  include  swap  yield  curves,  currency  exchange  rates  and  implied volatilities. These embedded derivatives result in Level 3 classification because one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Significant unobservable inputs generally include: the extrapolation beyond observable limits of the swap yield curves and implied volatilities,  actuarial  assumptions  for  policyholder  behavior  and  mortality  and  the  potential  variability  in  policyholder behavior and mortality, nonperformance risk and cost of capital for purposes of calculating the risk margin.",

      "answer": "Starbucks utilizes valuation models such as Black Scholes' option pricing model and discounted cash flow models with unobservable inputs to determine the fair value of its private equity instruments. Similarly, General Motors invests in private equity and debt funds where the NAV is based on valuation models that also rely on unobservable inputs, particularly for long-term equity investments in private companies. Both companies depend on complex models with non-market corroborated data for valuing these illiquid assets, which introduces estimation risk and requires careful management oversight.",

        "Hop 1: SBUX \u2192 Valuation Models: Starbucks applies valuation models like Black Scholes and discounted cash flow with unobservable inputs to value private equity instruments.",

      "question": "How does the structure of Starbucks' stock-based compensation grants under Stock Appreciation Rights compare to Tesla's use of the 2019 Plan in terms of equity instruments available and vesting timelines?",
      "answer": "Starbucks grants Stock Appreciation Rights as part of its equity incentive plans, though it notes that stock options have not been broadly used recently. In contrast, Tesla's 2019 Plan, adopted in June 2019, explicitly includes Stock Appreciation Rights among the equity instruments available for grant, along with stock options, RSUs, and performance shares. Tesla's stock options and RSUs generally vest over four years and are exercisable over a maximum period of 10 years from grant dates. Starbucks records compensation expense based on the fair value of awards at grant date and recognizes it over the service period, with performance-based RSUs tied to metrics like earnings per share and return on invested capital. Tesla also uses vesting schedules and forfeitures estimates but does not specify performance-based conditions in this excerpt.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Government Subsidies\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ('CARES Act'), which among other things, provides employer payroll tax credits for wages paid to employees who are unable to work during the COVID19 pandemic and options to defer payroll tax payments for a limited period. Based on our evaluation of the CARES Act, we qualify for certain employer payroll tax credits as well as the deferral of payroll tax payments in the future. Additionally, the Canadian government enacted the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy ('CEWS') to help employers offset a portion of their employee wages for a limited period. We elected to treat qualified government subsidies from the U.S., Canada and other governments as offsets to the related operating expenses. The CARES Act and CEWS were no longer applicable to us in late fiscal 2021. The qualified payroll credits reduced our store operating expenses by $210.0 million and $349.6 million on our consolidated statement of earnings during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. After netting the qualified credits against our payable, a receivable balance of $69.4 million and $172.4 million was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively. As of October 2, 2022, deferred payroll tax payments of $116.5 million were included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. As of October 3, 2021, deferred payroll tax payments of $116.4 million were included in both accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $26.1 million and $30.9 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $104.7 million and $116.5 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs') or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return and metrics focused on building inclusive and diverse teams. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-ScholesMerton option valuation model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. If applicable, our total shareholder return relative to our peer group is incorporated into the underlying assumptions using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to calculate grant date fair value. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award, and only for those awards expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nOur international operations generally use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI on our consolidated balance sheets.",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                 | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. |\n| We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.

      "answer": "SBUX uses discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of private equity instruments, which are classified as Level 3 due to the use of unobservable inputs. In contrast, Level 2 derivatives\u2014such as those held by NKE\u2014are valued using internal discounted cash flow models that rely on observable inputs like interest rates and foreign exchange rates. NKE reported $557 million in derivative assets at fair value, with $493 million in other current assets and $64 million in other long-term assets, indicating a significant but categorized exposure. This comparison reveals that while both companies rely on discounted cash flow techniques, SBUX\u2019s use involves less observable data (Level 3), whereas NKE\u2019s derivatives fall under Level 2 due to the observable nature of their valuation inputs.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nLevel 3: We determine the fair value of private equity instruments using valuation models, including Black Scholes' option pricing model and discounted cash flow models. Inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\n\nAssets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis may include items such as property, plant and equipment, ROU assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments, and other assets. We determine the fair value of these items using Level 3 inputs, as described in the related sections below.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nWe manage our exposure to various risks within our consolidated financial statements according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge interest rates, commodity prices, foreign currency-denominated revenue streams, inventory purchases, and assets, liabilities, and investments in certain foreign operations. In order to manage our ex posure to these risks, we use various types of derivative instruments including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars, and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of a purchased call option and a sold put option with equal premiums to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows, or to limit possible gains or losses on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to ex change cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets, and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nWe record all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and typically do not offset derivative assets and liabilities. Cash flows from derivative financial instruments and the related gains and losses are classified as cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments and cross-currency swaps, we generally do not enter into derivative instruments with maturities longer than three years. However, we are allowed to net settle transactions with respective counterparties for certain derivative contracts, inclusive of interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards, with a single, net amount payable by one party to the other. We also enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, cash collateral received under collateral security arrangements was $230.9 million and $77.1 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, cash collateral pledged as part of our commodity derivative margin requirements was $12.4 million and $20.6 million, respectively, and is included in prepaid ex penses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The potential effects of netting arrangements with our derivative contracts, excluding the effects of collateral, would not have had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets. We also hold cash and cash equivalents from various settled-to-market exchange traded futures related to coffee and dairy hedging.\n\nBy using these derivative instruments, we expose ourselves to potential credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with carefully selected, credit-worthy counterparties and distribute contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the derivative's gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive income ('OCI') and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') on our consolidated balance sheets. The gain or loss is subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings, in the same line item as the underlying hedged item on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nCash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the transactions are no longer likely to occur, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Net Investment Hedges\n\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the derivative's, or qualifying non-derivative instrument's, gain or loss is reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.",

Counterparty credit risk, which is mitigated by master netting agreements and collateral posting arrangements with certain counterparties, had an impact on derivative fair value estimates that was not material. The Company's derivative financial instruments are discussed in Note 17.\n\nLevel 2 other liabilities are primarily arrangements that are valued based on the fair value of underlying investments, which are generally measured using Level 1 and Level 2 fair value techniques.\n\nLevel 2 borrowings, which include commercial paper, U.S. dollar denominated notes and certain foreign currency denominated borrowings, are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or identical instruments in markets that are not active.\n\nLevel 3 borrowings include the Asia Theme Park borrowings, which are valued based on the current borrowing cost and credit risk of the Asia Theme Parks as well as prevailing market interest rates.\n\nThe Company's financial instruments also include cash, cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate the fair values.\n\n## Non-recurring Fair Value Measure\n\nThe Company also has assets that may be required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are evaluated when certain triggering events occur (including a decrease in estimated future cash flows) that indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges as disclosed in Notes 4 and 18. Fair value was determined using estimated discounted future cash flows, which is a Level 3 valuation technique (see Note 2 for a discussion of the more significant inputs used in our discounted cash flow analysis).\n\n## Credit Concentrations\n\nThe Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments on an ongoing basis and does not currently anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\n\nThe Company does not expect that it would realize a material loss, based on the fair value of its derivative financial instruments as of September 28, 2024, in the event of nonperformance by any single derivative counterparty. The Company generally enters into derivative transactions only with counterparties that have a credit rating of A- or better and requires collateral in the event credit ratings fall below A- or aggregate ex posures ex ceed limits as defined by contract. In addition, the Company limits the amount of investment credit exposure with any one institution.\n\nThe Company does not have material cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that have below investment grade credit ratings and maintains short-term liquidity balances in high quality money market funds. At September 28, 2024, the Company's balances (excluding money market funds) with individual financial institutions that ex ceeded 10% of the Company's total cash and cash equivalents were 24% of total cash and cash equivalents. At September 30,",

      "answer": "Nike generated $7,547 million in revenue from the Greater China region in 2022, which includes Taiwan along with mainland China and Hong Kong. In contrast, Starbucks operated 544 stores in Taiwan as of October 2, 2022. Given that Nike's revenue figure represents a broader regional performance across multiple countries while Starbucks' store count is specific to Taiwan, the comparison highlights different dimensions of market presence\u2014Nike's being revenue-based across a larger geographic cluster, and Starbucks' being operationally focused with a localized footprint in Taiwan.",

      "question": "How does McDonald's recognition of revenue from affiliates compare to General Motors' financial treatment of transactions with nonconsolidated affiliates involved in car production, particularly in terms of performance obligations and timing of revenue recognition?",
      "answer": "McDonald's recognizes revenue from affiliates over the franchise term as performance obligations are satisfied, typically spanning 20 years, with royalties based on a percentage of sales recognized at the time of sale.

The pronouncement expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted the new standard in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Refer to the Segment footnote on page 52 of this Form 10-K for the enhanced disclosures added as a result of the adoption of A SU 2023-07.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" (\"ASU 2023-09\"). The pronouncement expands the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. A SU 2023-09 is effectiv e for fiscal y ears beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that A SU 2023-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## Disaggregation - Income Statement Expenses\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, \"Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\" (\"ASU 2024-03\"). The pronouncement expands the disclosure requirements for expenses, specifically by providing more detailed information about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. A SU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that A SU 2024-03 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-owned and operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company's Other revenues are primarily comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the M cDonald's brand and thirdparty revenues for the Dynamic Y ield business, for periods prior to its sale on A pril 1, 2022.\n\nSales by Company-owned and operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Initial fees are recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years.\n\nThe Company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees that are distinct from the franchise agreement because they do not require integration with other goods or services that the Company provides. The Company has determined that it is the principal in these arrangements. Accordingly, the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These revenues are recognized as the goods or services are transferred to the franchisee, and related expenses are recognized as incurred, primarily within Other restaurant expenses. There may be a timing difference between the costs the Company incurs and the related fees the Company receives from franchisees, but the various technology platform fees are not designed to generate margins for the Company. Brand licensing arrangement revenues are based on a percent of sales and are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. For periods prior to A pril 1, 2022, Dynamic Y ield third party revenues were generated from providing software as a service solutions to customers and were recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service was performed.\n\n## PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings-up to 40 years; leasehold improvements-the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include certain option periods; and equipment-3 to 12 years.\n\nThe Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.\n\nThe Company may share in the cost of certain restaurant improvements with its franchisees. Since M cDonald's generally manages the project and provides up front funding in these instances, during the project the Company estimates which costs are the responsibility of M cDonald's and which are the responsibility of the franchisee, and allocates the corresponding costs between Property and equipment and Accounts receivable. Upon the completion of the project, the allocation of costs is finaliz ed and may result in immaterial adjustments to the balances and associated depreciation expense.\n\nRefer to the Property and Equipment footnote on page 54 of this Form 10-K for additional information.",

Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company's Other revenues are primarily comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the M cDonald's brand and thirdparty revenues for the Dynamic Y ield business, for periods prior to its sale on A pril 1, 2022.\n\nSales by Company-owned and operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Initial fees are recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years.\n\nThe Company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees that are distinct from the franchise agreement because they do not require integration with other goods or services that the Company provides. The Company has determined that it is the principal in these arrangements. Accordingly, the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These revenues are recognized as the goods or services are transferred to the franchisee, and related expenses are recognized as incurred, primarily within Other restaurant expenses. There may be a timing difference between the costs the Company incurs and the related fees the Company receives from franchisees, but the various technology platform fees are not designed to generate margins for the Company. Brand licensing arrangement revenues are based on a percent of sales and are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. For periods prior to A pril 1, 2022, Dynamic Y ield third party revenues were generated from providing software as a service solutions to customers and were recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service was performed.\n\n## PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings-up to 40 years; leasehold improvements-the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include certain option periods; and equipment-3 to 12 years.\n\nThe Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.\n\nThe Company may share in the cost of certain restaurant improvements with its franchisees. Since M cDonald's generally manages the project and provides up front funding in these instances, during the project the Company estimates which costs are the responsibility of M cDonald's and which are the responsibility of the franchisee, and allocates the corresponding costs between Property and equipment and Accounts receivable. Upon the completion of the project, the allocation of costs is finaliz ed and may result in immaterial adjustments to the balances and associated depreciation expense.\n\nRefer to the Property and Equipment footnote on page 54 of this Form 10-K for additional information.",

In contrast, HD adopted ASU No. 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and included additional disclosures about significant segment expenses, as noted in Note 2. The ASU, issued in November 2023, requires public companies to provide more detailed breakdowns of segment expenses. This difference in implementation depth\u2014SBUX's general segment reporting versus HD's enhanced expense disaggregation\u2014introduces variability in how operating costs are presented, thereby complicating cross-company comparisons of segment-level profitability and cost structures.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Deferred Revenues\n\nOur deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type, and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily include expenses related to raw materials, purchased goods, packaging, and delivery, along with operational costs of our supply chain organization. This encompasses wages, benefits, occupancy costs, and depreciation associated with sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Additionally, it includes costs related to inventory and supply chain asset impairments.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions, and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees, and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation",

Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to be included in our consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate prov isions for income taxes hav e been determined for these entities. For unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, we are required to make an assertion regarding reinv estment or repatriation for tax purposes. For any earnings that we do not make a permanent reinv estment assertion, we recognize a prov ision for deferred income taxes. For earnings where we hav e made a permanent reinv estment assertion, no prov ision is recognized. See Note 6 for further discussion.\n\nWe are subject to global intangible low-taxed income tax, an incremental tax on foreign income. We hav e made an accounting election to record this tax in the period the tax arises.\n\n## Comprehensive Income\n\nComprehensive income includes net earnings adjusted for certain gains and losses that are excluded from net earnings and recognized within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of equity, which consists primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments. Accumulated other comprehensiv e loss also includes net losses on cash flow hedges that were immaterial as of February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024. Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensiv e loss into earnings were immaterial in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nAssets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Rev enues and expenses are translated using av erage exchange rates for the period, and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction. Cumulativ e foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensiv e loss as of February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024 were losses of $970 million and $365 million, respectiv ely.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nASU No. 2023-07. In Nov ember 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, 'Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improv ements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,' which is intended to improv e reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The disclosure requirements included in ASU No. 2023-07 are required for all public entities, including entities with a single reportable segment. ASU No. 2023-07 is effectiv e for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance is required to be applied on a retrospectiv e basis. We adopted ASU No. 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The adoption of this guidance resulted in additional financial statement disclosures and had no impact to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 2 which includes the disclosures resulting from our adoption of this guidance.\n\nASU No. 2022-04. In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations,' to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs used by an entity in connection with the purchase of goods and serv ices. The standard requires entities that use supplier finance programs to disclose the key terms of such programs, along with an annual rollforward of the related obligations, including the amount of obligations confirmed and the amounts paid during the period. ASU No. 2022-04 was effectiv e for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the required rollforward information, which was effectiv e for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We adopted ASU No. 2022-04 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, with the exception of the annual rollforward requirement, which was adopted on a prospectiv e basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The adoption of this guidance did not hav e an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n## Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nASU No. 2023-09. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 'Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improv ements to Income Tax Disclosures,' which requires disclosure of disaggregated information about a reporting entity's effectiv e tax rate reconciliation as well as disclosures on income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU No. 2023-09 is effectiv e for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance is required to be applied on a prospectiv e basis, with the option to apply the standard retrospectiv ely. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently ev aluating the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.",

      "question": "How does GM's $4.2 billion investment in nonconsolidated affiliates, which are involved in the production of trucks and crossovers, compare to Tesla's reliance on internal production capacity for its 2022 automotive revenue growth of $19.52 billion?",
      "answer": "GM's $4.2 billion investment in nonconsolidated affiliates reflects its strategy of outsourcing key aspects of vehicle production, particularly for trucks and crossovers, through joint ventures. These affiliates are directly involved in the development, production, and marketing of vehicles, and GM engages in transactions to purchase and sell vehicles and parts from these entities. In contrast, Tesla relies on internal production capacity, with automotive sales revenue increasing by $19.52 billion in 2021 due to production ramping at Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory, indicating a vertically integrated approach. This highlights a fundamental difference in production strategy between the two companies\u2014GM leveraging external partnerships versus Tesla scaling internal manufacturing capabilities.",

Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer.\n\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue.\n\n## 2021 compared to 2020\n\nAutomotive sales revenue increased $19.52 billion, or 79%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of 433,815 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries year over year from production ramping at both Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory at a slightly higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales offset by regional sales mix. Additionally, we had a $365 million net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees, which increased our automotive sales revenue, due to actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021. The increases in automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease of 28,819 Model S and Model X cash deliveries at a higher combined average selling price as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X only began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $115 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional credits in the prior year and changes in pricing in certain regions.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue increased $590 million, or 56%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct sales-type leasing revenue as we have a full year of sales in 2021 since we began offering the program during the third quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined.\n\nServices and other revenue increased $1.50 billion, or 65%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow and retail merchandise revenue.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives.",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                 | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. |\n| We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.

      "question": "How did Tesla's 2021 Model 3 and Model Y delivery growth of 433,815 units compare to GM's use of nonconsolidated affiliates for vehicle production, and what does this suggest about their respective manufacturing strategies?",
      "answer": "Tesla achieved a 433,815-unit year-over-year increase in Model 3 and Model Y deliveries in 2021 through production ramping at Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory, reflecting its vertically integrated manufacturing strategy. In contrast, GM relies on nonconsolidated affiliates involved in the development, production, and marketing of trucks, crossovers, cars, and automobile parts, purchasing and selling component parts and vehicles from these partners. This suggests Tesla focuses on internal scaling of high-volume vehicle production, while GM leverages external partnerships to manage production capacity and diversify manufacturing risk.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Automotive &amp; Services and Other Segment\n\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash deliveries of new Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer.\n\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue.\n\n## 2021 compared to 2020\n\nAutomotive sales revenue increased $19.52 billion, or 79%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of 433,815 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries year over year from production ramping at both Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory at a slightly higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales offset by regional sales mix. Additionally, we had a $365 million net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees, which increased our automotive sales revenue, due to actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021. The increases in automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease of 28,819 Model S and Model X cash deliveries at a higher combined average selling price as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X only began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $115 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional credits in the prior year and changes in pricing in certain regions.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue increased $590 million, or 56%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct sales-type leasing revenue as we have a full year of sales in 2021 since we began offering the program during the third quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined.\n\nServices and other revenue increased $1.50 billion, or 65%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow and retail merchandise revenue.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives.",
