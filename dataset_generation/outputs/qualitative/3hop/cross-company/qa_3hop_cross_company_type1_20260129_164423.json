      "question": "How does Disney's pension asset allocation assumption for fixed income, which includes international bonds, compare to Verizon's valuation methodology for international bonds in terms of reliance on third-party pricing inputs?",
      "answer": "Disney assumes a long-term rate of return on plan assets that includes fixed income, which is composed of both domestic and international bonds, and considers third-party inputs like yield curves and interest rates for valuation. Fixed income, as disclosed in Disney's pension strategy, forms a key part of the asset mix used to estimate returns. Meanwhile, Verizon explicitly values international bonds using matrix pricing with input from independent third-party valuation sources, showing a direct reliance on external pricing models. Both companies use third-party inputs, but Disney's approach is embedded within broader pension return assumptions, while Verizon's is a direct valuation methodology applied to international bonds.",

Special situations: Investments in opportunistic strategies with the objective of diversifying and enhancing returns and exploiting short-term inefficiencies, as well as investments in promising new strategies of a longer-term nature. Private equity: Investments in private or public securities typically through privately-negotiated and/or structured transactions, including leveraged buyouts, venture capital, and distressed debt. Private credit: Investments focused on debt instruments, of which returns are driven by income rather than capital appreciation. Infrastructure: Investments in real assets, typically with long-term, predictable, and stable cash flows and a meaningful income component. | Investments in real estate, special situations, private equity, private credit, and infrastructure are typically invested in private partnerships and/or other pooled vehicles (Funds) which are generally classified as Net Asset Value as a Practical Expedient, since the Funds and underlying assets are not publicly traded and/or often have liquidity restrictions. The managers of the Funds value the assets using various inputs and techniques depending on the nature of the underlying investments. Techniques may include purchase multiples for comparable transactions, comparable public company trading multiples, discounted cash flow analysis, prevailing market capitalization rates, recent sales of comparable investments, and independent third-party appraisals. The total market value of each of the Funds is determined by aggregating the value of the underlying assets less liabilities. |\n",

In contrast, Alphabet maintains a dual-class stock structure where Class B shares carry 10 votes per share versus one vote per Class A share, allowing certain insiders greater control over corporate decisions.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairo s as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. Certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf are accounted for as advances and classified within other investments. Atairos may pledge our remaining unfunded capital commitment as security to lenders in connection with certain financing arrangements.  This has no effect on our funding commitments. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n\nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made cash capital contributions totaling $73 million, $145 million, and $52 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment, inclusive of advances classified within other investments, was $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.\n\n## Hulu and Collateralized Obligation\n\nIn  2019,  we  entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  with  The  Walt  Disney  Company  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries,  whereby  we  relinquished  our  board  seats  and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. Concurrent with these agreements, we also acquired additional ownership interest in Hulu previously held by AT&amp;T. Following these transactions, our interest was approximately 33% and we had the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of future equity capital calls. The agreements included put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we could require Disney to buy, and Disney could require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu. In the third quarter of 2023, we amended these agreements and agreed, among other things, that the put/call provisions regarding our interest could be exercised in November 2023 (in addition to subsequent periods) and that we would fund our share of prior equity capital calls if the put/call was ex ercised in November 2023.\n\nIn November 2023, we exercised our put right requiring Disney to purchase our interest in Hulu. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Disney paid us $8.6 billion, representing $9.2 billion for our share of Hulu's minimum equity value, less $557 million for our share of prior capital calls. Additional proceeds for any ex cess of the fair value of our interest over the $9.2 billion minimum equity value will be due following final determination of Hulu's fair value pursuant to a third-party appraisal process. In connection with the transaction, Disney also agreed to share with us 50% of the future tax benefits resulting from the purchase of our interest in Hulu. Because we continue to hold our interest in Hulu, the $9.2 billion payment from Disney is treated as an advance on the sale of our interest, which will be recognized following the finalization of the appraisal process. The receipt of the minimum proceeds resulted in a tax gain in 2023. The recorded value of our investment in Hulu of $883 million and $863 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, continues to reflect our historical cost in applying the equity method, and therefore, is less than its fair value.\n\nIn 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility, which was fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. The term loan was due at the earlier of March 2024 or upon receipt of the proceeds under the put/call provisions and was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe present the advance on the sale of our  investment  and  the  term  loan  separately  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  in  the  captions  'advance  on  sale  of investment' and 'collateralized obligation,' respectively.\n\n## Marketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify investments with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as marketable equity securities and the carrying values are primarily presented in other current assets. The changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities between measurement dates are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net.

      "answer": "Alphabet's Class B common stock carries 10 votes per share, which incentivizes the company to strategically manage its share repurchases by focusing on Class A and Class C shares to avoid diluting voting control. In 2024, Alphabet repurchased $62.0 billion worth of Class A and Class C shares, preserving the influence of Class B shareholders. This structure contrasts with Meta's disclosure, where Class A common stock is registered on Nasdaq with no distinction in voting rights from other classes mentioned, suggesting a more uniform shareholder equity framework. Meta does not indicate a multi-tiered voting structure, which implies a different governance and equity management approach compared to Alphabet.",

We inv est primarily in debt securities, including gov ernment bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate deriv ativ es. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our inv estments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may hav e their fair market v alue adv ersely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains and losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, we hav e elected the fair v alue option for which changes in fair v alue are recorded in OI&amp;E. We measure securities for which we have not elected the fair v alue option at fair v alue with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit losses.\n\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the v alue of our inv estment portfolio. T he VaR is the expected loss in fair v alue, for a giv en confidence interv al, for our inv estment portfolio due to adv erse mov ements in interest rates.

If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                 | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. |\n| We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.

      "question": "How does the dual-class stock structure's impact on investor protections in META compare to the governance safeguards in GOOGL's Certificate of Incorporation, particularly regarding dividend rights and anti-takeover provisions?",
      "answer": "META's dual-class structure gives Class B shareholders, including Mr. Zuckerberg, disproportionate control over critical decisions like change-of-control transactions and board composition, and the company explicitly states that its status as a 'controlled company' could make its Class A common stock less attractive to investors. In contrast, GOOGL's Certificate of Incorporation includes explicit safeguards that prevent unequal dividend rights across its Class A, B, and C shares, requiring both board unanimity and affected class approval for amendments that would alter these rights. While both companies have multi-class structures with anti-takeover elements tied to their Certificates of Incorporation, GOOGL's governance framework provides stronger enumerated protections for equal treatment of shareholders in dividend distributions, whereas META's structure may limit Class A shareholders' influence in key corporate decisions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: META \u2192 Class A Common Stock: META's dual-class structure gives disproportionate control to Class B shareholders, including requiring Class B approval for change-of-control transactions and allowing staggered boards, which could depress stock price and investor interest in Class A shares",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Certificate of Incorporation: META's Certificate of Incorporation includes provisions that entrench current governance structures and limit shareholder rights, such as requiring Class B approval for certain corporate actions and restricting shareholder ability to act by written consent",
        "Hop 3: Certificate of Incorporation \u2190 GOOGL: GOOGL's Certificate of Incorporation contains explicit safeguards preventing unequal dividend rights across its multiple share classes, requiring both board unanimity and affected class approval for amendments that would alter these rights"

      "answer": "Alphabet's Class B common stock grants 10 votes per share, compared to 1 vote per share for Class A, which means that repurchasing Class A shares could disproportionately reduce the voting influence of non-Class B holders. In 2024, Alphabet repurchased $62.0 billion of Class A and Class C shares, potentially consolidating voting power among remaining Class B shareholders. Meanwhile, Comcast's 2024 10-K shows that it has no issued Class B shares and holds 4,651,093,045 Class A shares with $0.01 par value, indicating a more uniform voting structure. This contrast suggests that Alphabet's dual-class system allows for greater concentration of voting control even amid significant share repurchases, unlike Comcast's more egalitarian equity structure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Alphabet's Class B shares carry 10 votes per share and can convert to Class A shares upon sale or transfer, influencing voting control during repurchases.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Class A shares have only 1 vote per share, so repurchasing them while retaining Class B shares consolidates voting power among long-term holders.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: Comcast's 2024 disclosure shows 4,651,093,045 issued Class A shares with no issued Class B shares, indicating a more evenly distributed voting structure."

      "question": "How does NFLX's strategy of securing exclusive content rights compare to VZ's financial arrangement with American Tower Corporation, given the $5.0 billion upfront payment Verizon received in their 2015 transaction?",
      "answer": "NFLX strategically secures exclusive content rights to differentiate its service and maintain member satisfaction, which can increase programming costs and content volatility. In contrast, VZ's 2015 transaction with American Tower Corporation involved receiving $5.0 billion upfront in exchange for exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 wireless towers, allowing Verizon to monetize infrastructure while retaining operational capacity through subleases. While NFLX's exclusivity strategy focuses on content-driven member retention and competitive differentiation, VZ's exclusive rights arrangement centers on infrastructure monetization and long-term operational efficiency, illustrating two distinct corporate strategies around exclusivity\u2014one in content, the other in physical assets.",

        "Hop 1: NFLX \u2192 Exclusive Rights: NFLX selectively secures exclusive rights for content, including original programming, to differentiate its service and improve member retention, even as it faces rising programming costs and potential content withdrawal risks.",

The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to ex pose us to greater distribution ex penses in certain markets.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright, and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\n## Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology, business processes, and content.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairo s as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. Certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf are accounted for as advances and classified within other investments. Atairos may pledge our remaining unfunded capital commitment as security to lenders in connection with certain financing arrangements.  This has no effect on our funding commitments. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n\nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made cash capital contributions totaling $73 million, $145 million, and $52 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment, inclusive of advances classified within other investments, was $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.\n\n## Hulu and Collateralized Obligation\n\nIn  2019,  we  entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  with  The  Walt  Disney  Company  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries,  whereby  we  relinquished  our  board  seats  and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. Concurrent with these agreements, we also acquired additional ownership interest in Hulu previously held by AT&amp;T. Following these transactions, our interest was approximately 33% and we had the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of future equity capital calls. The agreements included put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we could require Disney to buy, and Disney could require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu. In the third quarter of 2023, we amended these agreements and agreed, among other things, that the put/call provisions regarding our interest could be exercised in November 2023 (in addition to subsequent periods) and that we would fund our share of prior equity capital calls if the put/call was ex ercised in November 2023.\n\nIn November 2023, we exercised our put right requiring Disney to purchase our interest in Hulu. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Disney paid us $8.6 billion, representing $9.2 billion for our share of Hulu's minimum equity value, less $557 million for our share of prior capital calls. Additional proceeds for any ex cess of the fair value of our interest over the $9.2 billion minimum equity value will be due following final determination of Hulu's fair value pursuant to a third-party appraisal process. In connection with the transaction, Disney also agreed to share with us 50% of the future tax benefits resulting from the purchase of our interest in Hulu. Because we continue to hold our interest in Hulu, the $9.2 billion payment from Disney is treated as an advance on the sale of our interest, which will be recognized following the finalization of the appraisal process. The receipt of the minimum proceeds resulted in a tax gain in 2023. The recorded value of our investment in Hulu of $883 million and $863 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, continues to reflect our historical cost in applying the equity method, and therefore, is less than its fair value.\n\nIn 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility, which was fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. The term loan was due at the earlier of March 2024 or upon receipt of the proceeds under the put/call provisions and was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe present the advance on the sale of our  investment  and  the  term  loan  separately  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  in  the  captions  'advance  on  sale  of investment' and 'collateralized obligation,' respectively.\n\n## Marketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify investments with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as marketable equity securities and the carrying values are primarily presented in other current assets. The changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities between measurement dates are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The fair values of our marketable equity securities are based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market prices.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

In contrast, CMCSA's Class A Common Stock has full voting rights on all matters.

      "answer": "The EU AI Act introduces harmonized rules across Europe, with high-risk AI provisions taking effect in August 2026, which could limit the deployment of certain AI systems or increase compliance costs. Google faces regulatory risk as it develops and implements AI in its offerings, including internal systems, and could face monetary penalties or other regulatory actions under the Act. Meanwhile, Meta is investing $70.13 billion in its Family of Apps in 2023, including AI-driven systems that rank content in its apps and new generative AI experiences, which may be subject to stricter compliance obligations under the EU AI Act. The phased implementation timeline gives both companies a window to adapt, but Meta\u2019s aggressive AI investment strategy and Google\u2019s reliance on AI for core services heighten their exposure to these evolving regulatory requirements.",

      "answer": "META's Class A common stock has limited voting power compared to its Class B common stock, where a single shareholder (Mr. Zuckerberg) retains significant control, with Class B shares requiring majority approval for change-in-control transactions until they represent less than 35% of combined voting power. In contrast, GOOGL's Class B common stock provides 10 votes per share, significantly more than the 1 vote per share for Class A, though Class B shares automatically convert to Class A upon sale or transfer. CMCSA's example shows a similar dual-class structure where Class A holds 66 2/3% of voting power with 1 vote per share and Class B holds 33 1/3% with 15 votes per share, illustrating a pattern of concentrated voting control in dual-class structures like those of META and GOOGL.",

        "Hop 1: META \u2192 Class A Common Stock: META's Class A common stock has limited investor appeal due to its controlled company status and lack of majority independent governance, with Class B shares maintaining control over major decisions until they fall below 35% of voting power.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: CMCSA's dual-class structure shows that Class A shares typically have lower voting power (1 vote per share) compared to Class B shares (15 votes per share), with Class B maintaining a non-dilutable percentage of voting power.",

      "question": "How does the voting power distribution tied to Class B common stock at CMCSA influence the potential conversion dynamics of Class A shares, especially in light of Alphabet's aggressive share repurchase strategy involving Class A and Class C shares?",
      "answer": "At CMCSA, Class B common stock holds 33 1/3% of the voting power, with each share entitled to 15 votes, and this voting power is non-dilutable under the company's articles of incorporation. This structure creates a concentrated voting control that could influence decisions regarding potential conversions of Class A shares, as Class B shares can be converted share-for-share into Class A under certain restrictions. Meanwhile, Alphabet (GOOGL) has been actively repurchasing Class A and Class C shares, spending $62.2 billion in 2023 alone and maintaining $36.3 billion in remaining authorization as of year-end. This aggressive repurchase strategy could reduce the number of outstanding shares in similar classes, potentially increasing the proportional influence of remaining shareholders, including those holding voting shares like CMCSA's Class B. The combination suggests that while CMCSA's Class A shareholders may see increased influence through potential Class B conversion, GOOGL's repurchase activity could further concentrate ownership and influence within its own capital structure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Alphabet repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023, with $36.3 billion remaining in repurchase authorization, directly affecting shareholder equity and ownership concentration.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: At CMCSA, Class B common stock holds 33 1/3% of the voting power with 15 votes per share, and this voting power is non-dilutable, creating a structural influence imbalance compared to Class A shares.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: CMCSA's Class B shares are convertible into Class A shares on a share-for-share basis, but only under certain restrictions, meaning any shift in ownership or strategic decision-making could be influenced by the holders of these higher-vote shares."

      "question": "How does the involvement of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in Disney's Five-Year Credit Agreement compare to its role in Netflix's revolving credit facility, particularly in terms of syndication and administrative responsibilities?",
      "answer": "Disney's Five-Year Credit Agreement, dated March 1, 2024, involves JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in a syndication and joint lead arranger role, as seen in similar agreements like Boeing\u2019s where JPMorgan also served as syndication agent. In contrast, Netflix's revolving credit facility, amended on March 6, 2023, lists JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. among the lenders but with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. acting as the administrative agent. This highlights that while JPMorgan holds a prominent syndication role in Disney\u2019s agreement, its involvement in Netflix\u2019s facility is more aligned with a lending participant rather than the lead administrative entity.",

      "answer": "VZ received $2.8 billion from Vertical Bridge REIT, LLC in December 2024 for the exclusive rights to over 6,000 wireless towers, which was accounted for as prepaid rent and a financing obligation. In contrast, T received $4.827 billion from Crown Castle in 2013 for 627 towers and the leasing rights to 9,048 additional towers, which was also treated as a financing obligation due to lack of control transfer. Both companies retained ownership of the towers on their balance sheets, but VZ's transaction involved a significantly larger number of towers (6,000) for a smaller upfront payment compared to T's deal, indicating differences in asset valuation and financing strategy related to wireless tower infrastructure.",

TOWER TRANSACTION\n\nIn December 2013, we closed our transaction with Crown Castle International Corp. (Crown Castle) in which Crown Castle gained the exclusive rights to lease and operate 9,048 wireless towers and purchased 627 of our wireless towers for $4,827 in cash. The leases have various terms with an average length of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, Crown Castle will have fix ed price purchase options for these towers totaling approximately $4,200, based on their estimated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. We are subleasing space on the towers from Crown Castle over an estimated original term of 20 years, at current market rates, subject to further optional renewals in the future.\n\nWe determined that we did not transfer control of the tower assets, which prevented us from achieving sale-leaseback accounting for the transaction, and we accounted for the cash proceeds from Crown Castle as a financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets. We record interest on the financing obligation using the effective interest method at a rate of approx imately 3.9%. The financing obligation is increased by interest ex pense and estimated future net cash flows generated and retained by Crown Castle from operation of the tower sites, and reduced by our contractual payments. We continue to include the tower assets in 'Property, Plant and Equipment - Net' on our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the tower assets had a balance of $608 and $647, respectively. Our depreciation expense for these assets was $39 for each of 2024, 2023 and 2022.",

      "answer": "GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion of its Class A and Class C shares in 2023, maintaining a multi-class structure where Class B shares carry 10 votes per share and convert automatically upon sale or transfer to Class A, which has 1 vote per share. In contrast, CMCSA's Class B shares carry 15 votes and are convertible share-for-share into Class A shares, with Class B's aggregate voting power capped at 33 1/3% and protected from dilution under its articles of incorporation. This means CMCSA has a stronger anti-dilution mechanism for its Class B shares compared to GOOGL, where Class B shares lose their enhanced voting rights upon conversion. Additionally, GOOGL's repurchase activity in 2023 may have concentrated voting control among remaining Class B shareholders by reducing the total number of Class A shares outstanding.",

This inflates subscriber numbers for individual services and may enhance perceived market penetration in Latin America where Combo+ is offered.

Alphabet's  investment  in  the  portfolio  of  Other  Bets  includes  emerging  businesses  at  various  stages  of  development, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nOther Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur  business  is  characterized  by  rapid  change  as  well  as  new  and  disruptive  technologies.  We  face  formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including from:\n\n- General  purpose  search  engines  and  information  services,  such  as  Baidu,  Microsoft's  Bing,  Naver,  Seznam, Yahoo, and Yandex.\n- Vertical search engines and e-commerce providers, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n- Social networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n- Other online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n- Other  forms  of  advertising,  such  as  billboards,  magazines,  newspapers,  radio,  and  television.  Our  advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n- Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n- Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of enterprise cloud services, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n- Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, ByteDance, Disney, Hulu, Meta, and Netflix.\n- Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products, such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Zoom.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme park and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruption of content production activities.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 related disruptions on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the currently unknowable duration and severity of COVID-19 and its variants, and among other things, governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests and talent.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairments totaling $5.0 billion, in part due to the negative impact COVID-19 has had on the International Channels business (see Note 18).\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\n\n## Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution\n\nDMED encompasses the Company's global film and episodic television content production and distribution activities. Content is distributed by a single organization across three significant lines of business: Linear Networks, Direct-toConsumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Content is generally created/licensed by four groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. The distribution organization has full accountability for the financial results of the entire media and entertainment business.\n\nThe operations of DMED's significant lines of business are as follows:\n\n- Linear Networks\n- Domestic Channels: ABC Television Network and eight owned ABC television stations (Broadcasting), and Disney, ESPN (80% interest), Freeform, FX and National Geographic (73% interest) branded domestic television networks (Cable)\n- International Channels: Disney, ESPN, Fox, National Geographic and Star branded television networks outside the U.S.\n- A 50% equity investment in A+E Television Networks (A+E), which operates a variety of cable channels including A&amp;E, HISTORY and Lifetime\n- Direct-to-Consumer\n- Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar, ESPN+ (68% effective interest), Hulu and Star+ direct-to-consumer (DTC) video streaming services\n- Content Sales/Licensing\n- Sale/licensing of film and television content to third-party television and subscription/advertising video-on-demand (TV/SVOD) services\n- Theatrical distribution\n- Home entertainment distribution (DVD, Blu-ray discs and electronic home video licenses)\n- Music distribution",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ntelevision  and  the  internet.  Our  home  service  group  performs  various  tasks,  including  installations,  servicing  and  upgrades  of customer premise equipment. Customers can use self-service help and support and perform self-installations for certain services.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete with a broad range of companies engaged in media, entertainment and communications services in Europe. For video services,  we  compete  with  cable  operators,  providers  of  both  paid-for  and  free-to-air  programming,  other  satellite  television providers, digital terrestrial television providers, content aggregators, home entertainment products companies, and other suppliers and providers of sports, entertainment, news and information that deliver DTC and other OTT streaming services. For broadband and wireless services, we compete with service providers making use of new fiber-optic networks, telecommunications providers, other  internet  service  providers  and  companies  developing  new  technologies  and  devices.  Our  competitive  position  may  be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of, or developments in, the means of delivery competitors use to provide their services as well as lowered prices, product innovations, new technologies or different value creation approaches. We also compete with organizations that are publicly funded, in whole or in part, to fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate.\n\nOur owned channels compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other television networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost for such content is significant.\n\nWe compete for the  sale  of  advertising  with  other  television  networks  and  stations,  digital  platforms,  and  all  other  advertising platforms. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from  us  may  be  adversely  affected  by  declines  in  television  viewership  and  the  increasing  number  of  entertainment  choices available.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, including Sky Glass and XClass TV, which launched in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sky Glass and XClass TV are smart televisions with operating systems that leverage our global technology platforms similar to Sky Q, X1 and Flex. We sell Sky Glass televisions in Europe, with the United Kingdom as the first market, to consumers that also subscribe to Sky's video services. XClass TVs are manufactured and sold by third parties and operate on our XClass TV operating system.\n\n## Seasonality and Cyclicality\n\nEach of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Cable Communications' results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year.\n\nRevenue  and  operating  costs  and  expenses  (comprised  of  total  costs  and  expenses,  excluding  depreciation  and  amortization expense) in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees.\n\nRevenue in Cable Communications, Media and Sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the United States is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season, and advertising related  to  candidates  running  for  political  office  and  issue-oriented  advertising,  respectively.  Revenue  in  Media  also  fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. Advertising revenue in Sky typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition in the summer during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup . TM\n\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms, including viewing on demand, DTC platforms or OTT service providers. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. We incur",

      "question": "How does the dual-class stock structure and voting rights limitations in META's Class A Common Stock compare to GOOGL's governance framework under their respective Certificates of Incorporation, particularly in terms of protecting minority shareholder interests?",
      "answer": "GOOGL's Certificate of Incorporation ensures equal dividend and liquidation rights across all stock classes and mandates unanimous board approval before amendments affecting stockholder rights can be proposed, with affected classes requiring to approve such changes. This provides a structural safeguard for minority shareholders. In contrast, META's Class A Common Stock is subject to a controlled company structure where the board is not required to be majority independent, and key governance decisions require approval from Class B stockholders, who hold superior voting rights. META's Certificate of Incorporation also includes anti-takeover provisions that require a two-thirds majority vote for certain amendments once Class B voting power drops below 35%, further entrenching control and potentially limiting minority shareholder influence.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Certificate of Incorporation: GOOGL\u2019s certificate mandates equal dividend and liquidation rights across all classes and requires unanimous board approval before amendments affecting stockholder rights can be proposed, with affected classes needing to approve such changes.",

This creates financial risk as costs may rise faster than revenue, and content can be withdrawn on short notice. In contrast, GOOGL's content costs for YouTube are largely variable, tied to revenue share models, subscriber counts, or flat fees paid to content providers. This structure allows GOOGL to scale content costs in line with revenue generation, potentially reducing margin pressure during periods of slower growth or increased competition.

We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of December 31, 2024, pricing on our paid plans ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1 to $32 per month, and pricing on our extra member sub accounts ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2 to $8 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations.\n\nWe also earn revenue from advertisements presented on our streaming service, consumer products, live events and various other sources. Revenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not a material component of streaming revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- our relationship with third-party service providers for the management, operation, sale and technology to support advertisements on our service;\n- our ability to develop and expand an advertising sales and advertising technology organization team;\n- our ability to develop the technology and related infrastructure to support advertising and drive value to advertisers;\n- the impact of our content and reputation on advertisers' willingness to spend with us; and\n- any member dissatisfaction due to advertisements.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n## If studios, content prov iders or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can enjoy depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including necessary distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to ex pose us to greater distribution ex penses in certain markets.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright, and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\n## Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology, business processes, and content.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and consumer products,",

We report rev enues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app dev elopers and end users for which we earn a serv ice fee.\n\n## Google Cloud Revenues\n\nGoogle Cloud rev enues consist of rev enues from:\n\n- Google  Cloud  Platform,  which  generates  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  for  infrastructure,  platform,  and  other  serv ices.  T hese serv ices  prov ide  access  to  solutions  such  as AI  offerings  including  our AI  infrastructure,  Vertex AI  platform,  and  Gemini  for  Google  Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n- Google  Workspace, which includes subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as  Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Driv e, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\n- other enterprise serv ices.\n\nOur cloud serv ices are generally prov ided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may hav e contract terms longer than a year.

Revenues related to cloud serv ices prov ided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably ov er the contract term as the customer receiv es and consumes the benefits of the cloud serv ices.\n\n## Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate rev enues to each performance obligation based on its relativ e standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\n\n## Customer Incentives and Credits\n\nCertain customers receiv e cash-based incentiv es or credits, which are accounted for as v ariable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce rev enues. We believ e that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration related to customer incentiv es and credits.\n\n## Sales Commissions\n\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of rev enues consists of TAC and other costs of rev enues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make av ailable our search access points and serv ices. Our distribution partners include browser prov iders, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software dev elopers; and\n- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of rev enues includes:\n- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  prov iders  from  whom  we  license  v ideo  and  other  content  for  distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content prov iders based on rev enues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;",

      "answer": "CMCSA competes with social networking platforms like Facebook for advertising dollars, intensifying pressure in the digital ad market. Facebook includes Reels as a core feature within its platform, aiming to boost user engagement and compete with short-form video platforms like TikTok. However, META has explicitly stated that Reels monetizes at a lower rate than feed and Stories products, which have more proven monetization mechanisms. Despite this, META continues to promote Reels as part of its broader strategy to grow user engagement across its family of apps. This suggests that META is prioritizing long-term user growth and platform stickiness over short-term ad revenue optimization, betting that increased engagement will lead to broader monetization opportunities in the future.",

      "answer": "META's Class B Common Stock has no voting rights except in specified merger or consolidation scenarios, where they receive voting power proportional to their conversion rate. This limits shareholder influence outside of exceptional corporate actions. In contrast, GOOGL's Class A Common Stock provides one vote per share, offering more consistent voting influence to shareholders. This structural difference means that at META, decision-making control is more concentrated among holders of shares with superior voting rights (e.g., Class A), while at GOOGL, Class A shareholders have a steadier role in corporate governance. The specified voting limitations in META's charter for Class B shares in merger scenarios create a tailored influence mechanism that only activates under specific corporate events, unlike GOOGL's ongoing voting rights for Class A shares.",

      "answer": "META's Class B common stock converts on a one-for-one basis into Class A common stock, but Class B holders are restricted from retaining ownership of Class A shares post-conversion and must sell or transfer them. This creates a structural requirement for insider selling in META, even as both stock classes receive the new $2.00 annual dividend. In contrast, GOOGL's Class B shares automatically convert to Class A upon sale or transfer, but without the same mandatory disposition requirement for Class A shares. Therefore, while both companies have dual-class structures with conversion mechanisms, META's forced disposition rule for Class A shares after conversion introduces a more predictable insider selling dynamic, especially now that both share classes receive the same dividend, potentially affecting market stability differently than at GOOGL.",

      "answer": "At META, the dual-class structure gives Class B common stockholders, primarily Mark Zuckerberg, outsized control, requiring a majority of Class B shares to approve change-of-control transactions until they represent less than 35% of combined voting power. In contrast, CMCSA's structure grants Class A common stockholders 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, with each Class B share having 15 votes, but Class B stock is non-dilutable and owned entirely by Brian L. Roberts. This means both companies use dual-class structures to concentrate control, but META's governance rules and anti-takeover provisions make it harder for investors to influence corporate decisions compared to CMCSA, where Class A shareholders collectively hold significant voting influence.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: META \u2192 Class A Common Stock: META's governance rules and dual-class structure could depress the stock price and limit investor influence, particularly due to the control held by Class B shareholders.",

        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: CMCSA's capital structure includes Class B common stock with disproportionate voting rights, concentrated in one individual, but still allows a broader base of influence through Class A shareholders."

      "question": "How does the geographic segmentation approach used by DIS for its operations in the Americas compare with the way GOOGL reports revenue performance in South America, particularly in terms of regional categorization and financial disclosure?",
      "answer": "DIS reports its operations in the Americas as a single geographic segment that includes both North and South America, with specific revenue figures disclosed for the region such as $68,218 million in total revenue from the Americas in 2022. In contrast, while GOOGL references South America as part of its 'Other Americas' reporting category, it does not provide separate financial metrics for South America alone and instead groups it with Canada and Latin America. This highlights a difference in how the two companies structure and disclose financial performance by region, with DIS offering more consolidated detail for the broader Americas region, while GOOGL lumps South America into a broader, less granular category.",

        "Hop 1: DIS \u2192 Americas: DIS reports $68,218 million in total revenue from the Americas in 2022, combining both DMED and DPEP segments, and treats the Americas as a unified geographic reporting segment.",
        "Hop 2: Americas \u2192 South America: According to Apple\u2019s 10-K, the Americas segment explicitly includes both North and South America, though financial details for South America alone are not provided by Apple or DIS.",
        "Hop 3: South America \u2190 GOOGL: GOOGL references South America as part of its 'Other Americas' region but does not break out specific revenue figures for South America, unlike DIS which includes it in the broader Americas total."

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

(1)\n\n## Revenue Backlog and Deferred Revenues\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 we had $51.0 billion of remaining performance obligations ('revenue backlog'), primarily related to Google Cloud, and expect to recognize approximately half of this amount as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining thereafter. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have  not  yet  been  recognized  as  revenues.  The  amount  and  timing  of  revenue  recognition  for  these  commitments  is largely driven by when our customers utilize services and our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenues. Revenue backlog includes  related  deferred  revenue  currently  recorded  as  well  as  amounts  that  will  be  invoiced  in  future  periods,  and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\n\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts  which  are  refundable.  Deferred  revenues  primarily  relate  to  Google  Cloud  and  Google  other.  Total  deferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 was $3.0 billion, of which $2.3 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ending December 31, 2021.\n\n## Note 3. Financial Instruments\n\n## Debt Securities\n\nWe classify our marketable debt securities, which are accounted for as available-for-sale within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value.\n\nFor  certain  marketable  debt  securities,  we  have  elected  the  fair  value  option  for  which  changes  in  fair  value  are recorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts. Unrealized net gains (losses) related to debt securities still held where we have elected the fair value option were $87 million and $(35) million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, the fair value of these debt securities was $2.0 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively.",

      "question": "How does the $2.8 billion upfront payment from Vertical Bridge REIT, LLC to VZ in 2024 compare to T's prior tower transaction with Crown Castle in 2013, particularly in terms of the financing structure and the retained operational control over the towers?",
      "answer": "The $2.8 billion upfront payment from Vertical Bridge to VZ in 2024 was primarily recorded as prepaid rent ($2.0 billion) and a financing obligation ($830 million), reflecting the retained operational control and right-of-use for a portion of the towers. In contrast, T's 2013 transaction with Crown Castle resulted in a $4.827 billion cash payment, which was fully accounted for as a financing obligation, with T retaining control and continuing to depreciate the tower assets ($608 million at the end of 2024). Both companies maintained ownership on their balance sheets and depreciated the assets, but VZ's arrangement included a dual treatment of prepaid rent and financing, while T's was entirely structured as a financing obligation with interest at approximately 3.9%.",

        "Hop 1: VZ \u2192 Vertical Bridge REIT, LLC: VZ received $2.8 billion from Vertical Bridge in exchange for exclusive rights to over 6,000 towers, with $2.0 billion classified as prepaid rent and $830 million as a financing obligation.",
        "Hop 2: Vertical Bridge REIT, LLC \u2192 Exclusive Rights: Vertical Bridge obtained exclusive rights to lease, operate, and manage the towers for ~30 years, with VZ leasing back capacity for 10 years with renewal options.",

For the majority of leases entered into during the current period, we have concluded it is not reasonably certain that we would exercise the options to extend the lease or not terminate the lease.

Under  the  terms  of  the agreement, Vertical Bridge has exclusive rights to lease, operate and manage the towers over an average term of approximately 30 years, with the option to acquire the towers at the end of the lease terms.

TOWER TRANSACTION\n\nIn December 2013, we closed our transaction with Crown Castle International Corp. (Crown Castle) in which Crown Castle gained the exclusive rights to lease and operate 9,048 wireless towers and purchased 627 of our wireless towers for $4,827 in cash. The leases have various terms with an average length of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, Crown Castle will have fix ed price purchase options for these towers totaling approximately $4,200, based on their estimated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. We are subleasing space on the towers from Crown Castle over an estimated original term of 20 years, at current market rates, subject to further optional renewals in the future.\n\nWe determined that we did not transfer control of the tower assets, which prevented us from achieving sale-leaseback accounting for the transaction, and we accounted for the cash proceeds from Crown Castle as a financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets. We record interest on the financing obligation using the effective interest method at a rate of approx imately 3.9%. The financing obligation is increased by interest ex pense and estimated future net cash flows generated and retained by Crown Castle from operation of the tower sites, and reduced by our contractual payments. We continue to include the tower assets in 'Property, Plant and Equipment - Net' on our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the tower assets had a balance of $608 and $647, respectively. Our depreciation expense for these assets was $39 for each of 2024, 2023 and 2022.",

      "question": "How does the dual-class stock structure at META, which negatively impacts the attractiveness of its Class A Common Stock, compare to CMCSA's non-dilutable 33 1/3% voting power held by Class B Common Stock in terms of long-term shareholder control implications?",
      "answer": "META's Class A Common Stock is negatively impacted by its controlled company status, where the dual-class structure gives Class B shareholders, including Mr. Zuckerberg, outsized voting control, requiring a majority of Class B shares to approve change-in-control transactions until they fall below 35% of combined voting power. Similarly, CMCSA maintains a non-dilutable 33 1/3% voting power for its Class B Common Stock, which holds 15 votes per share and cannot be diluted by additional issuances of other common stock classes. This structure at CMCSA ensures continued influence by key stakeholders, mirroring the control dynamics seen at META despite differing thresholds and mechanisms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: META \u2192 Class A Common Stock: META discloses that its controlled company status and dual-class structure negatively impact the attractiveness of its Class A Common Stock due to limited shareholder control and protections.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: CMCSA's Class A Common Stock has 66 2/3% of the voting power while Class B Common Stock has a non-dilutable 33 1/3% with each share carrying 15 votes, indicating a structural dependency between the two classes.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: CMCSA's 2023 filing shows that Class B Common Stock, though minimal in quantity (9,444,375 shares), holds significant non-dilutable voting power, reinforcing long-term control by certain shareholders."

      "question": "How might the dual-class stock structures at CMCSA and META, particularly the 15-vote-per-share advantage for Class B stockholders at CMCSA and the 35% Class B voting power threshold for blocking change-of-control transactions at META, similarly expose minority shareholders to governance risks?",
      "answer": "At CMCSA, Class B common stockholders, led by Brian L. Roberts, hold 33\u2153% of the combined voting power due to a 15-vote-per-share advantage, which can influence corporate decisions disproportionately relative to their economic stake. Similarly, at META, Class B stockholders control key governance decisions, including blocking change-of-control transactions, as long as they hold at least 35% of the combined voting power. Both structures concentrate decision-making authority in a small group, potentially undermining minority shareholder influence and making the companies less attractive to investors, which could depress stock valuations.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class B Common Stock: CMCSA discloses that Class B common stock has 15 votes per share, giving its holders 33\u2153% of the combined voting power despite a small economic stake.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: The voting disparity between Class B and Class A shares creates a governance structure where Class B shareholders can significantly influence corporate decisions.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 META: META highlights that as long as Class B shareholders maintain at least 35% of the combined voting power, they retain the ability to block change-of-control transactions, concentrating control and potentially harming minority shareholder interests."

      "answer": "Alphabet selectively repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023 while retaining Class B shares, which carry 10 votes per share, suggesting a strategy to maintain concentrated voting control. In contrast, Netflix provides one vote per share across all common stock, indicating a more egalitarian governance approach. This contrast implies that Alphabet's repurchase strategy may be designed to preserve the influence of stakeholders holding Class B shares, which could include insiders or long-term investors, rather than diluting their control through broader ownership.",

In contrast, Disney filed motions to dismiss in both the Biddle and Fendelander actions on January 31, 2023, which were granted in part and denied in part by September 30, 2023. Disney then filed another motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on December 1, 2023, which was also granted in part and denied in part on June 25, 2024.

AI has been used in Google Workspace for years to improv e grammar, efficiency, security, and more with features like Smart Reply, Smart Compose, and malware and phishing protection in Gmail. Now , Gemini for Google Workspace brings our AI-powered agents into Gmail, Docs, Sheets and more to help users write, organize, v isualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings.\n\n## Other Bets\n\nAcross Alphabet, we are also using technology to try to solv e big problems that affect a wide v ariety of industries, including transportation and health technology. Alphabet's inv estment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at v arious stages of dev elopment, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriv ing, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside inv estors. While these earlystage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating rev enue and making important strides in their industries. Rev enues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related serv ices, and internet serv ices.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptiv e technologies.

For example, for adv ertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and serv ices are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relev ance of our adv ertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and av ailability of our products and serv ices;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliv er their adv ertisements in an efficient and effectiv e manner across a v ariety of distribution channels; and\n- content prov iders, primarily based on the quality of our adv ertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate rev enues from adv ertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.",

Legal Proceedings and Claims\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is or may be involved in various legal or regulatory proceedings, claims or purported class actions related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour and other claims. The Company has been, and may in the future be, put on notice or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement.\n\nIn general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Company's financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Company's reputation and future operating results.\n\nThe Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. The outcomes of legal proceedings and other contingencies are, however, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. At this time, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible losses in excess of any amounts accrued, including losses that could arise as a result of application of non-monetary remedies, with respect to the contingencies it faces, and the Company's estimates may not prove to be accurate.\n\nIn management's opinion, resolution of all current matters, including those described below, is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial statements. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, payment or other contingency, the resolution of a matter could materially affect the Company's current or future results of operations or cash flows, or both, in a particular quarter.\n\n## Slack Litigation\n\nBeginning in September 2019, seven purported class action lawsuits were filed against Slack, its directors, certain of its officers and certain investment funds associated with certain of its directors, each alleging violations of securities laws in connection with Slack's registration statement on Form S-1 (the 'Registration Statement') filed with the SEC. All but one of these actions were filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Mateo, though one plaintiff originally filed in the County of San Francisco before refiling in the County of San Mateo (and the original San Francisco action was dismissed). The remaining action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the 'Federal Action'). In the Federal Action, captioned Dennee v. Slack Technologies, Inc., Case No. 3:19-CV-05857-SI, Slack and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in January 2020. In April 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. In May 2020, Slack and the other defendants filed a motion to certify the court's order for interlocutory appeal, which the court granted. Slack and the other defendants filed a petition for permission to appeal the district court's order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which was granted in July 2020. Oral argument was heard in May 2021. On September 20, 2021, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling. Slack filed a petition for rehearing with the Ninth Circuit on November 3, 2021, which was denied on May 2, 2022. Slack filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on August 31, 2022, which was granted on December 13, 2022. On June 1, 2023, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision vacating the Ninth Circuit's decision and remanded for further proceedings. The Ninth Circuit ordered the parties to submit additional briefing in light of the Supreme Court's decision. On February 10, 2025, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court's order and instructing the district court to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. The state court actions were consolidated in November 2019, and the consolidated action is captioned In re Slack Technologies, Inc. Shareholder Litigation, Lead Case No. 19CIV05370 (the 'State Court Action'). An additional state court action was filed in San Mateo County in June 2020 but was consolidated with the State Court Action in July 2020. Slack and the other defendants filed demurrers to the complaint in the State Court Action in February 2020. In August 2020, the court sustained in part and overruled in part the demurrers, and granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint, which they filed in October 2020. Slack and the other defendants answered the complaint in November 2020. Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on October 21, 2021, which remains pending. On October 26, 2022, the court stayed the State Court Action pending resolution of Slack's petition for a writ of certiorari in the Federal Action. The State Court Action remains stayed pending resolution of the appellate proceedings in the Federal Action. The Federal Action and the State Court Action seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief on",

The lawsuits are in the early stages, and at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss.\n\nOn November 18, 2022, a private antitrust putative class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company on behalf of a putative class of certain subscribers to YouTube TV (the 'Biddle Action'). The plaintiffs in the Biddle Action asserted a claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act based on allegations that Disney uses certain pricing and packaging provisions in its carriage agreements with virtual multichannel video distributors ('vMVPDs') to increase prices for and reduce output of certain services offered by vMVPDs. On November 30, 2022, a second private antitrust putative class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company on behalf of a putative class of certain subscribers to DirecTV Stream (the 'Fendelander Action'), making similar allegations. The Company filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim in both the Biddle Action and Fendelander Action on January 31, 2023. On September 30, 2023, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the Company's motions to dismiss both cases and, on October 13, 2023, the court issued an order consolidating both cases. On October 16, 2023, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint (the 'Consolidated Complaint'). The Consolidated Complaint asserts claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and certain Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, and Tennessee antitrust laws based on substantially similar allegations as the Biddle Action and the Fendelander Action. The Consolidated Complaint seeks injunctive relief, unspecified money damages and costs and fees. The Company intends to defend against the lawsuits vigorously and filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint for failure to state a claim on December 1, 2023. The Company's motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint was granted in part and denied in part on June 25, 2024. On September 12, 2024, the Court entered a case management order setting, among other dates, Plaintiffs' deadline to file their class certification motion on March 27, 2026. The consolidated lawsuit is in the early stages, and at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss.\n\nOn February 20, 2024, a private antitrust lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Y ork against the Company (including affiliates ESPN, Inc., ESPN Enterprises, Inc., and Hulu, LLC), Fox  Corporation, and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (collectively, 'Defendants'), by fuboTV Inc. and fuboTV Media Inc. (together, 'Fubo'). Fubo asserts claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and New York antitrust law based on the theories that (a) a planned joint venture between ESPN, Inc., Fox Corporation, and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc., which will distribute certain of Defendants' linear networks to consumers (the 'Sports Streaming JV'), will harm competition in alleged markets for the licensing of networks that offer live sports content and for streaming live pay tv, (b) certain alleged practices by which the Company and Fox Corporation license their networks to vMVPDs as a bundle increase prices and reduce output for services offered by vMVPDs, and (c) certain alleged pricing provisions in Defendants' carriage agreements with YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, as well as in Hulu + Live TV's carriage agreements with non-Defendant programmers, increase prices for services offered by vMVPDs. On April 8, 2024, Fubo filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against Defendants to prevent the formation of the Sports Streaming JV. On April 29, 2024, Fubo filed an amended complaint to add allegations of a purported market for 'skinny sports bundles', which Fubo claims the Sports Streaming JV will monopolize after its launch. After a hearing on Fubo's motion for preliminary injunction, the district court granted Fubo's motion on August 16, 2024, and enjoined the launch of the joint venture. On August 19, 2024, Defendants filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from the order for a preliminary injunction. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has granted Defendants' motion to expedite the appeal. Fubo further seeks injunctive relief, unspecified money damages and costs and fees. On September 26, 2024, the Company filed a motion to dismiss Fubo's claims brought under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and New York antitrust law, unrelated to the joint venture. The district court has set trial on all claims for October 6, 2025. The Company intends to defend against the lawsuit vigorously and at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss.\n\nIn May 2024, the Company and NBCU entered into a confidential arbitration to resolve a dispute regarding the contractual appraisal process related to the determination of Hulu's equity fair value, in which the parties seek declaratory relief, equitable relief and unspecified damages. See Note 2 for a more detailed discussion of the arbitration and the determination of Hulu's equity fair value.\n\nThe Company, together with, in some instances, certain of its directors and officers, is a defendant in various other legal actions involving copyright, breach of contract and various other claims incident to the conduct of its businesses. Management does not believe that the Company has incurred a probable material loss by reason of any of those actions.\n\n## 15 Leases\n\nThe Company's operating leases primarily consist of real estate and equipment, including office space for general and administrative purposes, production facilities, land, cruise terminals, retail outlets and distribution centers for consumer products. The Company also has finance leases, primarily for broadcast equipment and land.",

      "question": "How does Comcast's reliance on content providers for programming impact Netflix's ability to secure streaming content, given the increasing competition and licensing challenges in the industry?",
      "answer": "Comcast's reliance on content providers for programming creates upstream competition for Netflix, as both companies depend on the same pool of content providers. According to CMCSA's 2024 10-K, Comcast depends on content providers for its programming, which means it may bid against Netflix for exclusive rights. This competition is reflected in Netflix\u2019s 2024 10-K, which states that as content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to license content on acceptable terms, potentially increasing costs or limiting availability. Furthermore, Netflix earns revenue primarily from streaming content, and any disruption in licensing could directly affect its service and revenue, which was reported as the primary source of income in 2024.",

The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to ex pose us to greater distribution ex penses in certain markets.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright, and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\n## Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology, business processes, and content.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies.

      "question": "How does the difference in voting rights structure between Class A and Class B shares at GOOGL compare to CMCSA's disclosure regarding its lack of voting rights in Atairos, and what implications does this have for corporate governance control in both entities?",
      "answer": "At GOOGL, Class A shares carry one vote per share while Class B shares carry ten votes per share, creating a dual-class structure that concentrates voting power among holders of Class B shares. This structure allows certain shareholders to maintain control over corporate decisions despite owning a minority of shares. In contrast, CMCSA explicitly discloses that it has no voting rights in Atairos, which is accounted for as an equity method investment, limiting its influence over Atairos\u2019s operations. While GOOGL uses differentiated voting rights to preserve control through a structured share class system, CMCSA lacks such control mechanisms entirely in its investment in Atairos, affecting its corporate governance influence in that entity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class A Common Stock: GOOGL has a multi-class share structure where Class A shares have one vote per share, while Class B shares have ten votes per share, impacting control dynamics.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Voting Rights: The distinction in voting rights among share classes is a core part of GOOGL\u2019s corporate governance, with Class B shares converting to Class A upon sale or transfer.",
        "Hop 3: Voting Rights \u2190 CMCSA: CMCSA discloses it has no voting rights in Atairos, which is treated as a VIE, and therefore lacks control over its operations despite being a significant investor."

Stockholders' Equity\n\n## Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\n\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to v oting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share.  Each share of  Class  B common stock is entitled to 10  v otes  per  share.  Class  C  capital  stock  has no  v oting  rights,  except  as required by applicable law . Shares of Class B common stock may be conv erted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically conv ert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we continued to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prev ailing market conditions, including the relativ e trading prices and v olumes of the Class A and Class C shares. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we repurchased $59.3 billion, $62.2 billion, and $62.0 billion, respectiv ely, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.\n\nIn April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2024, $44.7 billion remained av ailable for Class A and Class C share repurchases.\n\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairo s as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. Certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf are accounted for as advances and classified within other investments. Atairos may pledge our remaining unfunded capital commitment as security to lenders in connection with certain financing arrangements.  This has no effect on our funding commitments. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n\nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made cash capital contributions totaling $73 million, $145 million, and $52 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment, inclusive of advances classified within other investments, was $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.\n\n## Hulu and Collateralized Obligation\n\nIn  2019,  we  entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  with  The  Walt  Disney  Company  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries,  whereby  we  relinquished  our  board  seats  and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. Concurrent with these agreements, we also acquired additional ownership interest in Hulu previously held by AT&amp;T. Following these transactions, our interest was approximately 33% and we had the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of future equity capital calls. The agreements included put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we could require Disney to buy, and Disney could require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu. In the third quarter of 2023, we amended these agreements and agreed, among other things, that the put/call provisions regarding our interest could be exercised in November 2023 (in addition to subsequent periods) and that we would fund our share of prior equity capital calls if the put/call was ex ercised in November 2023.\n\nIn November 2023, we exercised our put right requiring Disney to purchase our interest in Hulu. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Disney paid us $8.6 billion, representing $9.2 billion for our share of Hulu's minimum equity value, less $557 million for our share of prior capital calls. Additional proceeds for any ex cess of the fair value of our interest over the $9.2 billion minimum equity value will be due following final determination of Hulu's fair value pursuant to a third-party appraisal process. In connection with the transaction, Disney also agreed to share with us 50% of the future tax benefits resulting from the purchase of our interest in Hulu. Because we continue to hold our interest in Hulu, the $9.2 billion payment from Disney is treated as an advance on the sale of our interest, which will be recognized following the finalization of the appraisal process. The receipt of the minimum proceeds resulted in a tax gain in 2023. The recorded value of our investment in Hulu of $883 million and $863 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, continues to reflect our historical cost in applying the equity method, and therefore, is less than its fair value.\n\nIn 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility, which was fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. The term loan was due at the earlier of March 2024 or upon receipt of the proceeds under the put/call provisions and was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe present the advance on the sale of our  investment  and  the  term  loan  separately  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  in  the  captions  'advance  on  sale  of investment' and 'collateralized obligation,' respectively.\n\n## Marketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify investments with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as marketable equity securities and the carrying values are primarily presented in other current assets. The changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities between measurement dates are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The fair values of our marketable equity securities are based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market prices.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "META initiated its first-ever cash dividend program in 2024, paying $0.50 per share for both Class A and Class B common stock, indicating equal treatment in dividends. In contrast, GOOGL's certificate of incorporation includes structural safeguards that legally prevent unequal per-share dividends across Class A, B, and C stock, requiring board unanimity before any amendment affecting dividend rights can be proposed and separate stockholder approval from the affected class. This means while both companies currently treat all common stock classes equally with respect to dividends, GOOGL has embedded stronger governance protections to ensure this equality is preserved over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Certificate of Incorporation: GOOGL has safeguards in its certificate of incorporation that legally prevent unequal per-share dividends across stock classes, requiring board unanimity and separate stockholder approval for amendments affecting dividend rights.",
        "Hop 2: Certificate of Incorporation \u2192 Class B Common Stock: The certificate explicitly ensures equal dividend rights across all stock classes, including Class B, and prevents the board from declaring unequal dividends.",
        "Hop 3: META \u2190 Class B Common Stock: META announced a dividend policy in 2024 that pays the same $0.50 per share on both Class A and Class B common stock, showing equal treatment, but without the same level of structural governance safeguards as GOOGL."

      "answer": "CMCSA relinquished substantially all voting rights associated with its investment in Hulu in 2019, including board seats, in exchange for a put/call arrangement with Disney that guaranteed a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for its interest and resulted in an $8.6 billion payment from Disney in 2023. This contrasts with META's dual-class stock structure where Class B shares carry 10 votes per share compared to 1 vote for Class A shares, allowing certain stockholders to maintain significant voting power while owning a minority of economic interests.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairo s as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. Certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf are accounted for as advances and classified within other investments. Atairos may pledge our remaining unfunded capital commitment as security to lenders in connection with certain financing arrangements.  This has no effect on our funding commitments. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n\nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made cash capital contributions totaling $73 million, $145 million, and $52 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment, inclusive of advances classified within other investments, was $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.\n\n## Hulu and Collateralized Obligation\n\nIn  2019,  we  entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  with  The  Walt  Disney  Company  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries,  whereby  we  relinquished  our  board  seats  and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. Concurrent with these agreements, we also acquired additional ownership interest in Hulu previously held by AT&amp;T. Following these transactions, our interest was approximately 33% and we had the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of future equity capital calls. The agreements included put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we could require Disney to buy, and Disney could require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu. In the third quarter of 2023, we amended these agreements and agreed, among other things, that the put/call provisions regarding our interest could be exercised in November 2023 (in addition to subsequent periods) and that we would fund our share of prior equity capital calls if the put/call was ex ercised in November 2023.\n\nIn November 2023, we exercised our put right requiring Disney to purchase our interest in Hulu. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Disney paid us $8.6 billion, representing $9.2 billion for our share of Hulu's minimum equity value, less $557 million for our share of prior capital calls. Additional proceeds for any ex cess of the fair value of our interest over the $9.2 billion minimum equity value will be due following final determination of Hulu's fair value pursuant to a third-party appraisal process. In connection with the transaction, Disney also agreed to share with us 50% of the future tax benefits resulting from the purchase of our interest in Hulu. Because we continue to hold our interest in Hulu, the $9.2 billion payment from Disney is treated as an advance on the sale of our interest, which will be recognized following the finalization of the appraisal process. The receipt of the minimum proceeds resulted in a tax gain in 2023. The recorded value of our investment in Hulu of $883 million and $863 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, continues to reflect our historical cost in applying the equity method, and therefore, is less than its fair value.\n\nIn 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility, which was fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. The term loan was due at the earlier of March 2024 or upon receipt of the proceeds under the put/call provisions and was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe present the advance on the sale of our  investment  and  the  term  loan  separately  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  in  the  captions  'advance  on  sale  of investment' and 'collateralized obligation,' respectively.\n\n## Marketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify investments with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as marketable equity securities and the carrying values are primarily presented in other current assets. The changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities between measurement dates are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The fair values of our marketable equity securities are based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market prices.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "VZ received an upfront payment of $5.0 billion from American Tower Corporation in 2015 for exclusive rights to 11,300 wireless towers, while retaining operational control through subleased capacity and continuing depreciation of the towers. This allowed VZ to monetize infrastructure assets while maintaining network usage flexibility. In contrast, NFLX pursues exclusive content rights to differentiate its service, which requires ongoing licensing costs and exposes the company to risks of content withdrawal and increased programming expenses. Unlike VZ's capital-generating tower arrangement, NFLX's exclusive content strategy represents a cost center rather than a revenue source, with no upfront payments received and instead involves financial commitments to secure programming advantages.",

Our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 1 year to 30 years, some of which include options that we can elect to extend the leases term for up to 25 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases. For the majority of leases entered into during the current period, we have concluded it is not reasonably certain that we would exercise the options to extend the lease or not terminate the lease. Therefore, as of the lease commencement date, our lease terms generally do not include these options. We include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\n\nDuring December 2024, we completed a transaction with V ertical Bridge REIT , LLC (V ertical Bridge) pursuant to which V ertical Bridge obtained the exclusive rights  to  lease,  operate  and  manage  over 6,000  wireless  towers  from  V erizon  in  exchange  for  an  upfront  payment  of  $2.8  billion.  Under  the  terms  of  the agreement, Vertical Bridge has exclusive rights to lease, operate and manage the towers over an average term of approximately 30 years, with the option to acquire the towers at the end of the lease terms.

The  upfront  payment,  which  is  primarily  included  within  Other  liabilities  on  our consolidated balance sheet, is accounted for as prepaid rent and as a financing obligation. We recorded prepaid rent of $2.0 billion related to the portion of the towers for which the right-of-use has passed to V ertical Bridge, which is reflected in Cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, we recorded a financing obligation of $830 million related to the portion of the towers that we continue to occupy and use for network operations, which is reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nDuring M arch 2015, we completed a transaction with A merican T ower Corporation (A merican T ower) pursuant to which A merican T ower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American T ower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates in 2015, with options to renew. We continue to include the towers in Property , plant and equipment, net in our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly.\n\nIn addition to the rights to lease and operate the towers, V ertical Bridge and A merican T ower assumed the interest in the underlying ground leases related to these towers.

The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to ex pose us to greater distribution ex penses in certain markets.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright, and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\n## Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology, business processes, and content.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and consumer products,",

      "question": "How do the differences in stock class structures and corporate strategies between META and GOOGL affect ownership concentration and voting power dynamics?",
      "answer": "GOOGL has implemented a significant share repurchase strategy, retiring $62.2 billion worth of Class A and Class C shares in 2023 alone, which reduces the number of publicly traded shares and could concentrate ownership among remaining shareholders. Meanwhile, its Class B common stock automatically converts to Class A shares upon sale or transfer, ensuring that high-vote shares are not retained by external investors. META, on the other hand, maintains a dual-class structure where Class B shares are not publicly traded and are held by only 23 stockholders of record, preserving concentrated voting power within a small group. While META recently introduced a dividend policy applicable to both classes, the lack of liquidity for Class B shares reinforces long-term control by insiders. These differing approaches reflect contrasting strategies: GOOGL is reducing public float while allowing for eventual conversion to equal voting rights, whereas META maintains a rigid separation that preserves control by a select group.",

      "answer": "Alphabet's $70 billion share repurchase program, which includes Class A shares, could reduce the supply of Class A shares in the market, potentially increasing their relative value. This may incentivize Class B shareholders\u2014who hold shares with 10x voting rights but often face restrictions on holding Class A shares after conversion\u2014to convert and sell Class A shares before further scarcity and price appreciation occur. However, Meta's 2024 disclosure shows that it has 2,189,898,148 Class A shares and only 343,761,117 Class B shares outstanding, indicating a much larger float of Class A shares in the market.

      "answer": "Netflix's common stock provides each share with one vote, promoting a more egalitarian shareholder governance model. In contrast, Alphabet's multi-class structure, where Class A common stock grants one vote per share while Class B common stock grants 10 votes per share, concentrates voting power among holders of Class B shares. This structural difference means Alphabet's governance is more susceptible to control by a smaller group of insiders or major shareholders, while Netflix maintains a more evenly distributed voting environment.",

        "Hop 1: NFLX \u2192 Voting Rights: Netflix discloses that each share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders.",

TOWER TRANSACTION\n\nIn December 2013, we closed our transaction with Crown Castle International Corp. (Crown Castle) in which Crown Castle gained the exclusive rights to lease and operate 9,048 wireless towers and purchased 627 of our wireless towers for $4,827 in cash. The leases have various terms with an average length of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, Crown Castle will have fix ed price purchase options for these towers totaling approximately $4,200, based on their estimated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. We are subleasing space on the towers from Crown Castle over an estimated original term of 20 years, at current market rates, subject to further optional renewals in the future.\n\nWe determined that we did not transfer control of the tower assets, which prevented us from achieving sale-leaseback accounting for the transaction, and we accounted for the cash proceeds from Crown Castle as a financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets. We record interest on the financing obligation using the effective interest method at a rate of approx imately 3.9%. The financing obligation is increased by interest ex pense and estimated future net cash flows generated and retained by Crown Castle from operation of the tower sites, and reduced by our contractual payments. We continue to include the tower assets in 'Property, Plant and Equipment - Net' on our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the tower assets had a balance of $608 and $647, respectively. Our depreciation expense for these assets was $39 for each of 2024, 2023 and 2022.",

Leasing Arrangements\n\nWe enter into  various  lease  arrangements  for  network  equipment  including  towers,  distributed  antenna  systems,  small  cells,  real  estate  and  connectivity mediums including dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations. Our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 1 year to 30 years, some of which include options that we can elect to extend the leases term for up to 25 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases. For the majority of leases entered into during the current period, we have concluded it is not reasonably certain that we would exercise the options to extend the lease or not terminate the lease. Therefore, as of the lease commencement date, our lease terms generally do not include these options. We include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\n\nDuring December 2024, we completed a transaction with V ertical Bridge REIT , LLC (V ertical Bridge) pursuant to which V ertical Bridge obtained the exclusive rights  to  lease,  operate  and  manage  over 6,000  wireless  towers  from  V erizon  in  exchange  for  an  upfront  payment  of  $2.8  billion.  Under  the  terms  of  the agreement, Vertical Bridge has exclusive rights to lease, operate and manage the towers over an average term of approximately 30 years, with the option to acquire the towers at the end of the lease terms. We have leased back a portion of the capacity on the towers from V ertical Bridge for an initial term of 10 years, with eight optional renewal terms of five years each, subject to certain early termination rights. W e continue to include the towers in Property , plant and equipment, net  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  depreciate  them  accordingly .  The  upfront  payment,  which  is  primarily  included  within  Other  liabilities  on  our consolidated balance sheet, is accounted for as prepaid rent and as a financing obligation. We recorded prepaid rent of $2.0 billion related to the portion of the towers for which the right-of-use has passed to V ertical Bridge, which is reflected in Cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, we recorded a financing obligation of $830 million related to the portion of the towers that we continue to occupy and use for network operations, which is reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nDuring M arch 2015, we completed a transaction with A merican T ower Corporation (A merican T ower) pursuant to which A merican T ower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American T ower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates in 2015, with options to renew.

Leasing Arrangements\n\nWe enter into  various  lease  arrangements  for  network  equipment  including  towers,  distributed  antenna  systems,  small  cells,  real  estate  and  connectivity mediums including dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations. Our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 1 year to 30 years, some of which include options that we can elect to extend the leases term for up to 25 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases. For the majority of leases entered into during the current period, we have concluded it is not reasonably certain that we would exercise the options to extend the lease or not terminate the lease. Therefore, as of the lease commencement date, our lease terms generally do not include these options. We include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\n\nDuring December 2024, we completed a transaction with V ertical Bridge REIT , LLC (V ertical Bridge) pursuant to which V ertical Bridge obtained the exclusive rights  to  lease,  operate  and  manage  over 6,000  wireless  towers  from  V erizon  in  exchange  for  an  upfront  payment  of  $2.8  billion.  Under  the  terms  of  the agreement, Vertical Bridge has exclusive rights to lease, operate and manage the towers over an average term of approximately 30 years, with the option to acquire the towers at the end of the lease terms. We have leased back a portion of the capacity on the towers from V ertical Bridge for an initial term of 10 years, with eight optional renewal terms of five years each, subject to certain early termination rights. W e continue to include the towers in Property , plant and equipment, net  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  depreciate  them  accordingly .  The  upfront  payment,  which  is  primarily  included  within  Other  liabilities  on  our consolidated balance sheet, is accounted for as prepaid rent and as a financing obligation. We recorded prepaid rent of $2.0 billion related to the portion of the towers for which the right-of-use has passed to V ertical Bridge, which is reflected in Cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, we recorded a financing obligation of $830 million related to the portion of the towers that we continue to occupy and use for network operations, which is reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nDuring M arch 2015, we completed a transaction with A merican T ower Corporation (A merican T ower) pursuant to which A merican T ower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American T ower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates in 2015, with options to renew. We continue to include the towers in Property , plant and equipment, net in our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly.\n\nIn addition to the rights to lease and operate the towers, V ertical Bridge and A merican T ower assumed the interest in the underlying ground leases related to these towers. While V ertical Bridge and A merican T ower can renegotiate the terms of and are responsible for paying the ground leases, we are still the primary obligor for these leases and accordingly , the present value of these ground leases are included in our operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities.

      "question": "How does the voting power dilution protection for Class B Common Stock at CMCSA compare with the automatic conversion provisions for Class B Common Stock at GOOGL, particularly in light of CMCSA's share-for-share conversion restriction and GOOGL's voluntary and transfer-triggered conversion policy?",
      "answer": "At CMCSA, the Class B Common Stock has a non-dilutable 33 1/3% aggregate voting power, which cannot be diluted by additional issuances of any other class of common stock, and is convertible share-for-share into Class A Common Stock, subject to certain restrictions. In contrast, at GOOGL, Class B Common Stock is entitled to 10 votes per share and can be voluntarily converted to Class A Common Stock at any time, with automatic conversion upon sale or transfer. This means CMCSA\u2019s Class B shares maintain structural voting protection unaffected by issuance volumes, while GOOGL\u2019s Class B shares lose enhanced voting rights upon transfer, making CMCSA's Class B shares more resilient to voting dilution.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class A Common Stock: CMCSA has 4,651,093,045 issued Class A shares with 66 2/3% voting power, and Class B shares are convertible share-for-share into Class A, subject to restrictions.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: The Class B shares at CMCSA maintain 33 1/3% of total voting power, which is non-dilutable under its charter, and conversion of Class B shares could shift voting control but is limited by restrictions.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 GOOGL: GOOGL\u2019s Class B shares carry 10 votes per share, but automatically convert to Class A upon sale or transfer, effectively limiting long-term voting entrenchment compared to CMCSA\u2019s structure."

      "question": "How does the foreign exchange risk exposure of Netflix's forecasted revenue transactions compare to Disney's VAR model estimates, given both companies' use of financial instruments to hedge against currency fluctuations?",
      "answer": "Netflix uses forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk on forecasted revenue transactions denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies, while Disney employs a VAR model that excludes forecasted transactions from its risk estimation. Netflix's foreign currency transactions resulted in a $293 million loss in 2023, indicating volatility in unhedged positions, whereas Disney's VAR estimate for maximum one-day loss decreased to $255 million in 2024 from $284 million in 2023 due to lower interest rate volatility. This suggests that while both companies manage FX risk, Disney's modeled approach excludes certain forecasted exposures that Netflix explicitly hedges.",

      "question": "How does the $0.6 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded by DIS in fiscal 2024 relate to the auditor's evaluation of significant assumptions, and how does this compare to the auditor's approach in testing significant assumptions at NFLX related to content amortization estimates?",
      "answer": "The $0.6 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded by DIS in fiscal 2024 was directly tied to the fair value assessment of the entertainment linear networks reporting unit, which relied on significant assumptions such as future revenues, operating margins, terminal growth rates, and discount rates. The auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, evaluated the reasonableness of these assumptions by comparing them to historical performance, external market data, and evidence obtained elsewhere in the audit. Similarly, at NFLX, the auditor (also PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP) tested significant assumptions used in content amortization estimates, including forecasted viewing hour consumption and historical viewing patterns, by comparing them to current trends and prior actual results. Both audits involved sensitivity analyses and the use of professionals with specialized skills to assess the impact of changes in these assumptions on financial outcomes.",

        "Hop 1: DIS \u2192 Significant Assumptions: DIS recorded a $0.6 billion goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2024 for its entertainment linear networks reporting unit, based on significant assumptions including future revenues, operating margins, terminal growth rates, and discount rates.",
        "Hop 2: Significant Assumptions \u2192 Auditor: The auditor evaluated the reasonableness of these assumptions by comparing them to historical performance, external market data, and audit evidence, using specialized professionals to assess the discount rate assumptions.",
        "Hop 3: Auditor \u2190 NFLX: At NFLX, the same auditor tested significant assumptions related to content amortization, including forecasted and historical viewing hour consumption, by comparing them to current trends and prior actual results, and performed sensitivity analyses."

We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results.

      "answer": "In CMCSA, Class B common stock has 15 votes per share and can be converted share-for-share into Class A common stock, which holds 66 2/3% of the voting power collectively.

In contrast, GOOGL's Class A shares have 1 vote per share while Class B shares have 10 votes per share, with automatic conversion to Class A upon sale or transfer. GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023, with $36.3 billion remaining available for further repurchases, which directly reduces the number of high-vote Class B shares in circulation through conversion mechanisms.",

      "answer": "At CMCSA, holders of Class B common stock maintain a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the voting power, with each Class B share entitled to 15 votes, whereas voting rights for Class A shares fluctuate based on the number of shares outstanding. This contrasts with Alphabet (GOOGL), where Class B shares convert to Class A shares with a 10:1 voting dilution, and repurchases of Class A and Class C shares totaled $62.0 billion in 2024. Since CMCSA\u2019s Class B shares are convertible share-for-share into Class A stock, but retain a fixed voting percentage, repurchases of Class A shares could increase the relative voting power of Class B holders, unlike Alphabet\u2019s structure where repurchases of Class A and C shares do not create a similar fixed voting skew due to the dilutive conversion mechanism.",

        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: CMCSA\u2019s 2024 financials show 9,444,375 Class B shares issued and outstanding, which are critical to maintaining the 33 1/3% voting power threshold, and any repurchase of Class A shares would increase the relative influence of Class B holders."

      "answer": "At CMCSA, the Class B common stock represents 33\u2153% of the combined voting power, with all shares beneficially owned by Brian L. Roberts, and only 3 record holders as of December 31, 2021. In contrast, GOOGL\u2019s Class A common stock had 300,754,904 shares outstanding as of January 25, 2022, with a much broader base of non-affiliate ownership contributing to a market value of approximately $1,451.1 billion as of June 30, 2021. Both structures tie voting rights to distinct stock classes, but CMCSA\u2019s Class B shares grant concentrated control to a single individual, while GOOGL\u2019s Class A shares are more widely distributed.",

Similarly, Verizon received $2.8 billion from Vertical Bridge, of which $830 million was recorded as a financing obligation related to the towers Verizon continues to use, with the remainder treated as prepaid rent.

TOWER TRANSACTION\n\nIn December 2013, we closed our transaction with Crown Castle International Corp. (Crown Castle) in which Crown Castle gained the exclusive rights to lease and operate 9,048 wireless towers and purchased 627 of our wireless towers for $4,827 in cash. The leases have various terms with an average length of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, Crown Castle will have fix ed price purchase options for these towers totaling approximately $4,200, based on their estimated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. We are subleasing space on the towers from Crown Castle over an estimated original term of 20 years, at current market rates, subject to further optional renewals in the future.\n\nWe determined that we did not transfer control of the tower assets, which prevented us from achieving sale-leaseback accounting for the transaction, and we accounted for the cash proceeds from Crown Castle as a financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets. We record interest on the financing obligation using the effective interest method at a rate of approx imately 3.9%. The financing obligation is increased by interest ex pense and estimated future net cash flows generated and retained by Crown Castle from operation of the tower sites, and reduced by our contractual payments. We continue to include the tower assets in 'Property, Plant and Equipment - Net' on our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the tower assets had a balance of $608 and $647, respectively. Our depreciation expense for these assets was $39 for each of 2024, 2023 and 2022.",

      "question": "How does the voting power distribution tied to Class B common stock at CMCSA compare to META's shareholder structure, given the distinct roles of Class A and Class B shares in each company?",
      "answer": "At CMCSA, the Class B common stock, which is entirely owned by Brian L. Roberts, carries 15 votes per share and represents 33\u2153% of the combined voting power, while holders of Class A common stock collectively hold 66\u2154% of the voting power. In contrast, META also issues both Class A and Class B common stock, but the structure and ownership concentration of voting rights differ significantly. META\u2019s Class A common stock is publicly traded and holds a majority of voting rights, while its Class B common stock, which is typically held by insiders, likely reinforces concentrated control. The distinct structures reflect different governance strategies, with CMCSA explicitly defining a non-dilutable 33\u2153% voting stake for Class B shares, whereas META\u2019s shareholder dynamics are shaped by the broader public ownership of Class A shares and insider control through Class B shares.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class B Common Stock: CMCSA discloses that Class B common stock has 15 votes per share, represents 33\u2153% of the combined voting power, and is entirely owned by Brian L. Roberts.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: The Class A common stockholders collectively hold 66\u2154% of the combined voting power, with voting rights dependent on the relative number of Class A and Class B shares outstanding.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 META: META discloses the existence of both Class A and Class B common stock, with Class A shares being publicly traded and Class B shares typically held by insiders, suggesting a dual-class structure similar to CMCSA but with distinct governance implications."

      "answer": "META discloses two classes of stock\u2014Class A and Class B\u2014with the latter carrying greater voting rights, though the exact ratio is not quantified in the filing. As of January 24, 2025, META had 2,189,898,148 Class A shares and 343,761,117 Class B shares outstanding, indicating a significant concentration of voting power within Class B. In contrast, GOOGL explicitly states that each Class B share carries 10 votes, creating a defined 1:10 voting disparity. GOOGL also repurchased $62.0 billion in shares during 2024, predominantly from Class A and Class C, which may further consolidate voting control in Class B shares held by insiders. This suggests that while both companies utilize dual-class structures to concentrate voting power, GOOGL's is more explicitly weighted and reinforced through aggressive capital allocation, whereas META\u2019s structure lacks detailed disclosure on voting disparity but similarly reflects a concentrated ownership base through disproportionate Class B shareholding.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: META \u2192 Class A Common Stock: META discloses Class A and Class B shares with different voting rights, and provides specific share counts as of January 24, 2025, showing a large disparity in the number of shares outstanding between the two classes.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: The relationship between the two stock classes lies in their differing voting rights, with Class B typically carrying more influence, as seen in both META and GOOGL's structures.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 GOOGL: GOOGL explicitly states that Class B shares have 10 votes each and shows a clear capital allocation strategy through $62.0 billion in 2024 share repurchases, which may reinforce Class B voting dominance."

In contrast, CMCSA explicitly states that holders of Class A common stock hold 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stockholders (beneficially owned entirely by Brian L. Roberts) hold 33 1/3% of the voting power. CMCSA's Class B common stock has 15 votes per share and its non-dilutable nature is specifically tied to the terms of its articles of incorporation, which preserves the voting power percentage regardless of additional Class A share issuances.",

      "answer": "AT&T adopted ASU 2020-04, which provides optional expedients for contract modifications triggered by reference rate reform (e.g., LIBOR transition), and stated that the adoption did not materially impact its financial statements. Meanwhile, Verizon disclosed that contract modifications affect the timing and scope of performance obligations, with $25.7 billion, $18.7 billion, and $7.5 billion expected to be recognized in 2024, 2025, and beyond, respectively. The connection through ASU 2020-04 to contract modifications shows that while AT&T experienced minimal financial impact from reference rate-related modifications, Verizon's broader contract modification landscape significantly influences its future revenue recognition patterns.",

      "answer": "DIS partners with content providers to license third-party streaming content, which exposes it to risks such as providers refusing to license content on acceptable terms or withdrawing content quickly, as noted in its filings. A major streaming platform (NFLX) highlights that content providers increasingly developing their own streaming services could lead to reduced access to popular content and rising licensing costs, directly impacting service quality and member retention. Meanwhile, CMCSA supplies its own streaming content through NBCUniversal, reducing reliance on third-party licensing and giving it more control over content availability and costs.

The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to ex pose us to greater distribution ex penses in certain markets.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright, and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\n## Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology, business processes, and content.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and consumer products,",

      "answer": "META's Class B common stock grants 10 votes per share, compared to 1 vote per share for Class A, giving certain shareholders disproportionate voting power.

In 2024, Alphabet repurchased $62.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares, prioritizing repurchases based on economic cost and market conditions.

      "answer": "Alphabet disclosed $22.1 billion in total stock-based compensation (SBC) expense for 2023, which includes RSU awards that, based on disclosed policy, do not carry voting rights (as seen in PMI's similar RSU structure). In contrast, Netflix's 2023 disclosures indicate that its common stockholders receive one vote per share, and its 2020 Stock Plan includes RSUs and restricted stock that likely carry voting rights since they are tied directly to common stock ownership. This suggests Alphabet's RSUs may dilute voting power less directly than Netflix's equity awards, despite both companies relying heavily on stock-based compensation.",

      "question": "How does the voting power distribution tied to CMCSA's Class B common stock, which is fully owned by Brian Roberts, influence the governance structure compared to GOOGL's dual-class stock system where Class A and Class B shares have different voting rights?",
      "answer": "CMCSA's Class B common stock, which is fully owned by Brian Roberts, holds 33 1/3% of the combined voting power with each share carrying 15 votes, creating a concentrated control mechanism that is non-dilutable under the company's articles of incorporation. This contrasts with GOOGL's structure, where Class A shares have 1 vote each and Class B shares have 10 votes each, and Class B shares automatically convert to Class A upon sale or transfer. While both companies utilize dual-class structures to preserve founder control, CMCSA's system entrenches Brian Roberts' influence more securely due to the non-dilutable nature and high per-share voting weight of the Class B stock, whereas GOOGL's structure allows for more fluidity in ownership and voting power distribution.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class B Common Stock: CMCSA discloses that Brian Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock, which carry 15 votes per share and represent 33 1/3% of the combined voting power.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: The Class B shares are non-dilutable and maintain a fixed percentage of voting power, while Class A shares collectively hold the remaining 66 2/3% of voting power, with each share having one vote.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 GOOGL: GOOGL also has a dual-class structure where Class A shares have one vote and Class B shares have 10 votes each, with Class B shares converting to Class A upon sale or transfer, allowing more flexibility in ownership changes."

      "answer": "GOOGL's Class B Common Stock provides its holders with 10 votes per share, significantly enhancing their influence over corporate decisions compared to Class A shares, which carry one vote per share. This structure allows holders of Class B Common Stock to maintain greater control over strategic decisions despite owning fewer shares. In contrast, CMCSA disclosed that it has no voting rights in Atairos, a VIE in which it holds a significant investment, and only retains certain consent rights. As a result, CMCSA lacks the power to direct Atairos\u2019s activities that most significantly impact its economic performance, which limits its control and influence over strategic decisions at Atairos.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class B Common Stock: GOOGL issues Class B Common Stock with 10 votes per share, giving holders disproportionate voting power compared to Class A shares.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Voting Rights: The key distinction of Class B Common Stock is its enhanced voting rights, which directly influence corporate governance and strategic direction.",
        "Hop 3: Voting Rights \u2190 CMCSA: CMCSA discloses it has no voting rights in Atairos, a VIE, and therefore cannot direct its strategic activities, contrasting sharply with the influence GOOGL\u2019s Class B shareholders maintain."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairo s as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. Certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf are accounted for as advances and classified within other investments. Atairos may pledge our remaining unfunded capital commitment as security to lenders in connection with certain financing arrangements.  This has no effect on our funding commitments. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n\nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made cash capital contributions totaling $73 million, $145 million, and $52 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment, inclusive of advances classified within other investments, was $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.\n\n## Hulu and Collateralized Obligation\n\nIn  2019,  we  entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  with  The  Walt  Disney  Company  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries,  whereby  we  relinquished  our  board  seats  and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. Concurrent with these agreements, we also acquired additional ownership interest in Hulu previously held by AT&amp;T. Following these transactions, our interest was approximately 33% and we had the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of future equity capital calls. The agreements included put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we could require Disney to buy, and Disney could require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu. In the third quarter of 2023, we amended these agreements and agreed, among other things, that the put/call provisions regarding our interest could be exercised in November 2023 (in addition to subsequent periods) and that we would fund our share of prior equity capital calls if the put/call was ex ercised in November 2023.\n\nIn November 2023, we exercised our put right requiring Disney to purchase our interest in Hulu. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Disney paid us $8.6 billion, representing $9.2 billion for our share of Hulu's minimum equity value, less $557 million for our share of prior capital calls. Additional proceeds for any ex cess of the fair value of our interest over the $9.2 billion minimum equity value will be due following final determination of Hulu's fair value pursuant to a third-party appraisal process. In connection with the transaction, Disney also agreed to share with us 50% of the future tax benefits resulting from the purchase of our interest in Hulu. Because we continue to hold our interest in Hulu, the $9.2 billion payment from Disney is treated as an advance on the sale of our interest, which will be recognized following the finalization of the appraisal process. The receipt of the minimum proceeds resulted in a tax gain in 2023. The recorded value of our investment in Hulu of $883 million and $863 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, continues to reflect our historical cost in applying the equity method, and therefore, is less than its fair value.\n\nIn 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility, which was fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. The term loan was due at the earlier of March 2024 or upon receipt of the proceeds under the put/call provisions and was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe present the advance on the sale of our  investment  and  the  term  loan  separately  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  in  the  captions  'advance  on  sale  of investment' and 'collateralized obligation,' respectively.\n\n## Marketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify investments with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as marketable equity securities and the carrying values are primarily presented in other current assets. The changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities between measurement dates are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The fair values of our marketable equity securities are based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market prices.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "Given that Comcast's Class B shares carry 15 votes each and represent 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, how does the absence of repurchase activity for these shares (only Class A shares were repurchased in 2023) impact Mr. Roberts' ownership control relative to the broader shareholder base?",
      "answer": "Comcast's Class B shares, which carry 15 votes per share and represent 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, are not being repurchased, while Class A shares (with fewer votes) are being actively repurchased. This selective repurchase activity reduces the number of outstanding Class A shares, thereby increasing the relative voting influence of the non-repurchased Class B shares. Since Mr. Brian L. Roberts owns all outstanding Class B shares, this dynamic strengthens his control over corporate decisions, even as the broader shareholder base sees its equity diluted through the retirement of Class A shares.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Alphabet (GOOGL) has been aggressively repurchasing its Class A and Class C shares, reducing their outstanding count and concentrating ownership, though these shares have only one vote each.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: At Comcast (CMCSA), Class A shares have fewer votes per share compared to Class B shares (1 vs. 15 votes), and the voting power is split such that Class B shares represent 33 1/3% of the total voting power, a non-dilutable stake.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: All Class B shares at Comcast are owned by Mr. Brian L. Roberts, giving him disproportionate control over voting outcomes, especially as Class A shares are repurchased and retired, reducing the count of publicly held voting shares."

      "answer": "The $5.0 billion transaction with American Tower in 2015 and the $2.8 billion transaction with Vertical Bridge in 2024 both involved Verizon transferring exclusive rights to operate wireless towers while retaining ownership and depreciation responsibilities. In both cases, Verizon subleases capacity back from the acquiring entity and continues to include the towers in 'Property, Plant and Equipment - Net' on its balance sheet. However, the Vertical Bridge deal resulted in a $2.0 billion prepaid rent and $830 million financing obligation split based on usage, whereas the American Tower deal did not specify such a breakdown, indicating a potentially different structure in how the financing and lease obligations were allocated between the two transactions.",

        "Hop 1: T \u2192 Exclusive Rights: T's 2013 transaction with Crown Castle involved exclusive rights to towers and resulted in a financing obligation due to lack of control transfer, with continued depreciation of $608 million in assets as of 2024.",

TOWER TRANSACTION\n\nIn December 2013, we closed our transaction with Crown Castle International Corp. (Crown Castle) in which Crown Castle gained the exclusive rights to lease and operate 9,048 wireless towers and purchased 627 of our wireless towers for $4,827 in cash. The leases have various terms with an average length of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, Crown Castle will have fix ed price purchase options for these towers totaling approximately $4,200, based on their estimated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. We are subleasing space on the towers from Crown Castle over an estimated original term of 20 years, at current market rates, subject to further optional renewals in the future.\n\nWe determined that we did not transfer control of the tower assets, which prevented us from achieving sale-leaseback accounting for the transaction, and we accounted for the cash proceeds from Crown Castle as a financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets. We record interest on the financing obligation using the effective interest method at a rate of approx imately 3.9%. The financing obligation is increased by interest ex pense and estimated future net cash flows generated and retained by Crown Castle from operation of the tower sites, and reduced by our contractual payments. We continue to include the tower assets in 'Property, Plant and Equipment - Net' on our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the tower assets had a balance of $608 and $647, respectively. Our depreciation expense for these assets was $39 for each of 2024, 2023 and 2022.",

For the majority of leases entered into during the current period, we have concluded it is not reasonably certain that we would exercise the options to extend the lease or not terminate the lease.

      "question": "How do the voting power dynamics of Class B shares at META and Comcast compare, and how might GOOGL's $62.2 billion share repurchase in 2023 impact its own dual-class structure relative to these companies?",
      "answer": "At META, Class B common stock is not publicly traded and carries 10 votes per share, with only 23 stockholders of record as of December 31, 2023, maintaining concentrated voting control. At Comcast, Class B common stock holds a fixed 33 1/3% of total voting power, with 15 votes per share and non-dilutable rights that protect its voting influence from being diluted by new issuances. Meanwhile, GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023, reducing the number of outstanding shares, which may increase the relative voting influence of remaining Class B shares that automatically convert upon sale. This suggests that while all three companies maintain multi-tiered voting structures, META and Comcast preserve long-term voting stability, whereas GOOGL\u2019s share repurchases may indirectly reinforce Class B dominance through reduced float.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class A Common Stock: GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023, which may affect the relative ownership balance between voting (Class B) and non-voting or limited-vote shares.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Class B shares carry significantly more voting power than Class A, and at companies like Comcast, Class B shares maintain a fixed and non-dilutable voting percentage, which informs how dual-class structures are designed to protect founder or insider control.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 META: META\u2019s Class B shares are not publicly traded and are held by a small group of 23 stockholders, preserving concentrated voting control, similar in intent to Comcast\u2019s fixed-vote structure, though implemented differently."

      "question": "How does AT&T's Revolving Credit Agreement covenant structure tied to investment-grade credit ratings compare with NFLX's credit facility terms?",
      "answer": "AT&T's Revolving Credit Agreement includes a net debt-to-EBITDA financial ratio covenant requiring a ratio not more than 3.75-to-1 and is tied to maintaining an investment-grade senior debt credit rating. If AT&T fails to meet these covenants, it could trigger Events of Default, resulting in accelerated payments and a 2.00% annual increase in the Applicable Margin. In contrast, NFLX's Revolving Credit Agreement does not mention a specific debt-to-EBITDA covenant but includes restrictions on debt incurrence by subsidiaries, limitations on granting liens, and prohibitions on certain corporate actions like mergers or asset sales. NFLX's agreement also carries a 0.10% annual commitment fee on undrawn amounts and interest rates tied to either the Alternate Base Rate or the Term SOFR Rate plus a 0.75% margin. Unlike AT&T, NFLX's agreement does not explicitly link covenant compliance to a credit rating or specify a financial ratio trigger for Events of Default.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AT&T \u2192 Events of Default: AT&T's Revolving Credit Agreement includes a financial covenant requiring a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of no more than 3.75-to-1 and is tied to maintaining an investment-grade rating, with Events of Default triggering accelerated payments and a 2.00% margin increase.",
        "Hop 2: Events of Default \u2192 Revolving Credit Agreement: Both AT&T and NFLX have credit agreements that include Events of Default and customary covenants, but the structure and triggers differ significantly between the two agreements.",
        "Hop 3: Revolving Credit Agreement \u2190 NFLX: NFLX's Revolving Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit debt incurrence by subsidiaries, restrict granting liens, and prohibit certain corporate actions, without tying these to a credit rating or specifying a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, and carries a 0.10% annual commitment fee and interest based on Alternate Base Rate or Term SOFR plus 0.75%."

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $990 million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024.

Land  and  assets  held  within construction in progress (CIP) are not depreciated. CIP assets are related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. We also capitalize interest on our debt related to certain eligible CIP assets and depreciate over the useful life of the related assets.\n\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.\n\n## Lease Obligations\n\nOur operating leases mostly comprise of certain data centers, offices, and colocations. We also have finance leases for certain network infrastructure. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception and most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed payments for maintenance, utilities, real estate tax es, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. These amounts are affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on energy production for renewable energy purchase arrangements, and maintenance and utilities.  Such variable lease costs are ex pensed as incurred on our consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities.\n\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.\n\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determining the probability  of  ex ercising  such  options,  we  consider  contract-based,  asset-based,  entity-based,  and  market-based  factors.  We  do  not  assume  renewals  in  our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar economic environment.\n\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded net impairment losses of $383 million, $2.43 billion, and $2.22 billion, respectively, in aggregate for operating lease ROU assets and leasehold improvements under ASC Topic 360 as a part of our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts. The fair values of the impaired assets were estimated using discounted cash flow models (income approach) based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs. The assumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining  lease  periods,  and  discount  rates  that  reflect  the  level  of  risk  associated  with  receiving  future  cash  flows.  For  additional  information  regarding  our restructuring efforts, see Note 3 - Restructuring.",

META specifically notes their dual-class system could make Class A common stock 'less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price' due to concentrated voting power requiring majority Class B approval for change-of-control transactions. Both companies maintain structures where Class B shares provide outsized voting influence that could negatively impact investor sentiment toward Class A shares, despite CMCSA's Class B shares being fully convertible.",

TOWER TRANSACTION\n\nIn December 2013, we closed our transaction with Crown Castle International Corp. (Crown Castle) in which Crown Castle gained the exclusive rights to lease and operate 9,048 wireless towers and purchased 627 of our wireless towers for $4,827 in cash. The leases have various terms with an average length of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, Crown Castle will have fix ed price purchase options for these towers totaling approximately $4,200, based on their estimated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. We are subleasing space on the towers from Crown Castle over an estimated original term of 20 years, at current market rates, subject to further optional renewals in the future.\n\nWe determined that we did not transfer control of the tower assets, which prevented us from achieving sale-leaseback accounting for the transaction, and we accounted for the cash proceeds from Crown Castle as a financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets. We record interest on the financing obligation using the effective interest method at a rate of approx imately 3.9%. The financing obligation is increased by interest ex pense and estimated future net cash flows generated and retained by Crown Castle from operation of the tower sites, and reduced by our contractual payments. We continue to include the tower assets in 'Property, Plant and Equipment - Net' on our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the tower assets had a balance of $608 and $647, respectively. Our depreciation expense for these assets was $39 for each of 2024, 2023 and 2022.",

      "answer": "CMCSA's Class B common stock has no voting rights, limiting shareholder influence on major decisions unless specific conditions are met, such as exiting the core payments business or undergoing a merger. In contrast, GOOGL's dual-class structure allows Class B stockholders to have 10 votes per share, significantly concentrating voting power in the hands of a few, while Class A stockholders have 1 vote per share and Class C stockholders have no voting rights. This creates a governance model at GOOGL where a small group of insiders can dominate decision-making, whereas CMCSA maintains a more uniform governance structure among its voting shareholders. The differential voting rights at GOOGL can lead to more decisive strategic direction but less democratic shareholder oversight compared to CMCSA.",

In 2023, GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion of its Class A and Class C shares, which likely further consolidated voting power among remaining Class B shareholders. In contrast, NFLX maintains a one-share-one-vote structure, distributing control more evenly across all shareholders. This structural difference means GOOGL\u2019s leadership has greater insulation from shareholder influence compared to NFLX, even as both companies manage capital through stock repurchases and equity grants.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class A Common Stock: GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion in Class A and Class C shares in 2023, reducing the number of publicly held shares and potentially concentrating ownership.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Voting Rights: GOOGL\u2019s Class A shares carry one vote per share, while Class B shares have 10 votes per share, creating a voting rights disparity that preserves control for certain stakeholders.",
        "Hop 3: Voting Rights \u2190 NFLX: NFLX\u2019s common stock provides one vote per share, meaning control is directly proportional to ownership percentage, unlike GOOGL\u2019s structure."

      "answer": "CMCSA issued 9,444,375 shares of Class B common stock in 2023, indicating a strategic move to maintain control while potentially raising capital without diluting voting power significantly. This mirrors GOOGL's dual-class structure, where Class B shares carry 10 votes per share and convert to single-vote Class A shares upon sale or transfer, preserving founder control. However, unlike GOOGL, which actively repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023, CMCSA's equity strategy appears more focused on maintaining a stable capital structure with no mention of a similar buyback program for Class B shares.",

      "answer": "META's Class B common stock, which represents 33 1/3% of the combined voting power and has 15 votes per share, is non-dilutable and held entirely by a single individual, creating concentrated voting control. In contrast, GOOGL has a structure where Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and can be converted to Class A (1 vote per share), with no mention of non-dilutable voting power. Additionally, GOOGL actively repurchased $62.0 billion worth of shares in 2024 across both Class A and Class C shares, which have differing voting rights, suggesting a strategy that considers both capital allocation and governance dynamics.",

The Company licenses characters from its film, television and other properties for use on third-party products in these categories and earns royalties, which are usually based on a fixed percentage of the wholesale or retail selling price of the products. Some of the major properties licensed by the Company include: Mickey and Friends, Star Wars, Spider-Man, Disney Princess, Avengers, Frozen, Toy Story, Winnie the Pooh and Cars.\n\n## Retail\n\nThe Company sells Disney-, Marvel-, Pixar- and Lucasfilm-branded products through shopDisney branded internet sites and Disney Store branded retail locations. At October 1, 2022, the Company owns and operates approximately 40 stores in Japan, 20 stores in North America, three stores in Europe and one store in China.\n\nThe Company creates, distributes and publishes a variety of products in multiple countries and languages based on the Company's branded franchises. The products include children's books and comic books.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's theme parks and resorts as well as Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club compete with other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. The profitability of the leisure-time industry may be influenced by various factors that are not directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations, health concerns, the political environment, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure time, oil and transportation prices, weather patterns and natural disasters. The licensing and retail business competes with other licensors, retailers and publishers of character, brand and celebrity names, as well as other licensors, publishers and developers of game software, online video content, websites, other types of home entertainment and retailers of toys and kids merchandise.\n\nAll of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on a year-round basis. Typically, theme park attendance and resort occupancy fluctuate based on the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities, the opening of new guest offerings and pricing and promotional offers. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods. The licensing, retail and wholesale businesses are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the Company's first and fourth fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases and cable programming broadcasts.\n\n## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION\n\nThe Company's businesses throughout the world are affected by its ability to exploit and protect against infringement of its IP, including trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and trade secrets. Important IP includes rights in the content of motion pictures, television programs, electronic games, sound recordings, character likenesses, theme park attractions, books and magazines, and merchandise. Risks related to the protection and exploitation of IP rights and information concerning the expiration of certain of our copyrights are set forth in Item 1A - Risk Factors.\n\n## AVAILABLE INFORMATION\n\nOur annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available without charge on our website, www.disney.com/investors, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed electronically with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

We also compete with organizations that are publicly funded, in whole or in part, to fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate.\n\nOur owned channels compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other television networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost for such content is significant.\n\nWe compete for the  sale  of  advertising  with  other  television  networks  and  stations,  digital  platforms,  and  all  other  advertising platforms. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from  us  may  be  adversely  affected  by  declines  in  television  viewership  and  the  increasing  number  of  entertainment  choices available.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, including Sky Glass and XClass TV, which launched in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sky Glass and XClass TV are smart televisions with operating systems that leverage our global technology platforms similar to Sky Q, X1 and Flex. We sell Sky Glass televisions in Europe, with the United Kingdom as the first market, to consumers that also subscribe to Sky's video services. XClass TVs are manufactured and sold by third parties and operate on our XClass TV operating system.\n\n## Seasonality and Cyclicality\n\nEach of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Cable Communications' results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year.\n\nRevenue  and  operating  costs  and  expenses  (comprised  of  total  costs  and  expenses,  excluding  depreciation  and  amortization expense) in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees.\n\nRevenue in Cable Communications, Media and Sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the United States is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season, and advertising related  to  candidates  running  for  political  office  and  issue-oriented  advertising,  respectively.  Revenue  in  Media  also  fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. Advertising revenue in Sky typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition in the summer during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup . TM\n\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms, including viewing on demand, DTC platforms or OTT service providers. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. We incur",

      "question": "How does the stability of CMCSA's Class B shares from 2020 to 2023 contrast with GOOGL's Class A share repurchase activity, and what does this imply about their respective shareholder control strategies given the dual-class share structure dynamics described?",
      "answer": "CMCSA's Class B shares remained constant at 9 million from 2020 to 2023, indicating no issuance or repurchase activity in this class, while GOOGL spent $36.347 billion under its repurchase program through December 2023, specifically targeting Class A shares. The dual-class share structure described\u2014where Class A shares typically carry more voting rights\u2014suggests that CMCSA has maintained a fixed base of control through Class B shares, whereas GOOGL has actively reduced its Class A share count, potentially consolidating control among fewer shareholders. This contrast in share management highlights differing approaches to governance and shareholder influence, with GOOGL using repurchases to reinforce control while CMCSA maintains a stable structure.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class B Shares: CMCSA's Class B shares remained unchanged at 9 million from 2020 to 2023, indicating no repurchase or issuance activity in this class.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Shares \u2192 Class A Shares: Dual-class share structures, like the one described, typically grant more voting power to Class A shares, with Class B shares often being publicly traded or held by insiders, and the two classes can be convertible into one another.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Shares \u2190 GOOGL: GOOGL spent $36.347 billion under its share repurchase program through December 2023, specifically targeting Class A shares, reducing the number of these shares outstanding."

      "answer": "Netflix's common stock provides one vote per share, establishing a straightforward voting rights framework. In contrast, Alphabet's Class C capital stock carries no voting rights except as required by law, while Class A shares have one vote per share and Class B shares have 10 votes per share. Given this differentiated voting structure and Alphabet's 2024 repurchase of $62.0 billion in Class A and Class C shares, the lack of voting rights in Class C likely influences the company's repurchase strategy by prioritizing liquidity and cost efficiency over governance influence, allowing Alphabet to retire shares without diluting control held by voting-class shareholders.",

      "question": "How does Disney's licensing revenue from Star Wars-branded merchandise influence its ability to fund content development for Disney+ in European markets where it competes with CMCSA's Sky Glass and XClass TV platforms?",
      "answer": "Disney earns licensing royalties from third-party products featuring Star Wars characters, which contributes to funding content development for its DTC services, including Disney+ in European markets. Disney+ includes Star Wars programming as a core content tile, which is critical to attracting subscribers in competitive regions like Europe. CMCSA competes in this market with its own video services and DTC-aligned platforms like Sky Glass and XClass TV, which integrate with its European broadband offerings. Therefore, licensing revenue from Star Wars enhances Disney's content investment capacity, directly supporting its competitive positioning against CMCSA\u2019s integrated hardware and content strategy in Europe.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ntelevision  and  the  internet.  Our  home  service  group  performs  various  tasks,  including  installations,  servicing  and  upgrades  of customer premise equipment. Customers can use self-service help and support and perform self-installations for certain services.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete with a broad range of companies engaged in media, entertainment and communications services in Europe. For video services,  we  compete  with  cable  operators,  providers  of  both  paid-for  and  free-to-air  programming,  other  satellite  television providers, digital terrestrial television providers, content aggregators, home entertainment products companies, and other suppliers and providers of sports, entertainment, news and information that deliver DTC and other OTT streaming services. For broadband and wireless services, we compete with service providers making use of new fiber-optic networks, telecommunications providers, other  internet  service  providers  and  companies  developing  new  technologies  and  devices.  Our  competitive  position  may  be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of, or developments in, the means of delivery competitors use to provide their services as well as lowered prices, product innovations, new technologies or different value creation approaches. We also compete with organizations that are publicly funded, in whole or in part, to fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate.\n\nOur owned channels compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other television networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost for such content is significant.\n\nWe compete for the  sale  of  advertising  with  other  television  networks  and  stations,  digital  platforms,  and  all  other  advertising platforms. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from  us  may  be  adversely  affected  by  declines  in  television  viewership  and  the  increasing  number  of  entertainment  choices available.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, including Sky Glass and XClass TV, which launched in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sky Glass and XClass TV are smart televisions with operating systems that leverage our global technology platforms similar to Sky Q, X1 and Flex. We sell Sky Glass televisions in Europe, with the United Kingdom as the first market, to consumers that also subscribe to Sky's video services. XClass TVs are manufactured and sold by third parties and operate on our XClass TV operating system.\n\n## Seasonality and Cyclicality\n\nEach of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Cable Communications' results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year.\n\nRevenue  and  operating  costs  and  expenses  (comprised  of  total  costs  and  expenses,  excluding  depreciation  and  amortization expense) in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees.\n\nRevenue in Cable Communications, Media and Sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the United States is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season, and advertising related  to  candidates  running  for  political  office  and  issue-oriented  advertising,  respectively.  Revenue  in  Media  also  fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. Advertising revenue in Sky typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition in the summer during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup . TM\n\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms, including viewing on demand, DTC platforms or OTT service providers. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. We incur",

The Company licenses characters from its film, television and other properties for use on third-party products in these categories and earns royalties, which are usually based on a fixed percentage of the wholesale or retail selling price of the products. Some of the major properties licensed by the Company include: Mickey and Friends, Star Wars, Spider-Man, Disney Princess, Avengers, Frozen, Toy Story, Winnie the Pooh and Cars.\n\n## Retail\n\nThe Company sells Disney-, Marvel-, Pixar- and Lucasfilm-branded products through shopDisney branded internet sites and Disney Store branded retail locations. At October 1, 2022, the Company owns and operates approximately 40 stores in Japan, 20 stores in North America, three stores in Europe and one store in China.\n\nThe Company creates, distributes and publishes a variety of products in multiple countries and languages based on the Company's branded franchises. The products include children's books and comic books.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's theme parks and resorts as well as Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club compete with other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. The profitability of the leisure-time industry may be influenced by various factors that are not directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations, health concerns, the political environment, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure time, oil and transportation prices, weather patterns and natural disasters. The licensing and retail business competes with other licensors, retailers and publishers of character, brand and celebrity names, as well as other licensors, publishers and developers of game software, online video content, websites, other types of home entertainment and retailers of toys and kids merchandise.\n\nAll of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on a year-round basis. Typically, theme park attendance and resort occupancy fluctuate based on the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities, the opening of new guest offerings and pricing and promotional offers. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods. The licensing, retail and wholesale businesses are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the Company's first and fourth fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases and cable programming broadcasts.\n\n## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION\n\nThe Company's businesses throughout the world are affected by its ability to exploit and protect against infringement of its IP, including trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and trade secrets. Important IP includes rights in the content of motion pictures, television programs, electronic games, sound recordings, character likenesses, theme park attractions, books and magazines, and merchandise. Risks related to the protection and exploitation of IP rights and information concerning the expiration of certain of our copyrights are set forth in Item 1A - Risk Factors.\n\n## AVAILABLE INFORMATION\n\nOur annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available without charge on our website, www.disney.com/investors, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed electronically with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

      "answer": "CMCSA's dual-class structure concentrates 33 1/3% non-dilutable voting power in Class B shares, which are convertible to Class A shares, giving certain shareholders disproportionate influence that persists despite share issuance. In contrast, META's single-class structure provides equal voting rights to all shareholders. This creates different governance dynamics where CMCSA's structure may preserve founder or institutional control over strategic decisions, while META's approach aligns more closely with broad shareholder democracy.",

        "Hop 1: META \u2192 Class A Common Stock: META discloses a single class of common stock with equal voting rights, indicating a governance model that emphasizes uniform shareholder influence.",

        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: CMCSA explicitly maintains a dual-class system with differentiated voting rights, allowing for strategic control retention through Class B shares while offering liquidity through convertibility to Class A shares."

      "question": "How might the automatic conversion of Class B shares to Class A shares upon transfer at Google, combined with Comcast's non-dilutable Class B voting structure, influence investor sentiment toward Meta's dual-class governance model that grants disproportionate voting control to its founder?",
      "answer": "Google's Class B shares automatically convert to Class A shares upon transfer, reducing long-term concentration of voting power. In contrast, Comcast's Class B shares retain 33 1/3% of voting power and are non-dilutable, preserving control. Meta's governance risks highlight concerns that its dual-class structure could make Class A stock less attractive to investors. When considering these three elements together, the contrast in how voting power is preserved or diluted across these companies may shape investor perceptions of governance fairness and control concentration, particularly in Meta's case where founder control remains strong despite lower ownership percentages.",

      "question": "How does Disney+'s inclusion of Pixar content strengthen its competitive position against Google's digital video services, particularly in light of Disney's indefinite-lived intangible asset classification for Pixar?",
      "answer": "Disney+'s inclusion of Pixar content enhances its competitive position by offering exclusive, high-quality family programming that differentiates its streaming service from Google's YouTube and other digital video platforms. As noted in Disney's 2022 10-K, Disney+ features Pixar-branded programming as a top-level tile within its interface, making it a core part of the user experience. This content library is supported by Disney's ownership stake in Pixar, which is classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, indicating long-term strategic value. In contrast, Google competes in digital video services with YouTube and other platforms but lacks comparable proprietary animated content, relying instead on third-party creators and licensing arrangements.",

Alphabet's  investment  in  the  portfolio  of  Other  Bets  includes  emerging  businesses  at  various  stages  of  development, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nOther Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur  business  is  characterized  by  rapid  change  as  well  as  new  and  disruptive  technologies.  We  face  formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including from:\n\n- General  purpose  search  engines  and  information  services,  such  as  Baidu,  Microsoft's  Bing,  Naver,  Seznam, Yahoo, and Yandex.\n- Vertical search engines and e-commerce providers, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n- Social networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n- Other online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n- Other  forms  of  advertising,  such  as  billboards,  magazines,  newspapers,  radio,  and  television.  Our  advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n- Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n- Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of enterprise cloud services, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n- Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, ByteDance, Disney, Hulu, Meta, and Netflix.\n- Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products, such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Zoom.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

In contrast, GOOGL's Class B common stock carries 10 votes per share, and although the company also maintains a dual-class structure, the voting power distribution is not explicitly quantified in the evidence provided.

      "answer": "At CMCSA, Class A common stockholders hold 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, with each share of Class A common stock receiving a variable number of votes depending on the outstanding shares, while each share of Class B common stock has 15 votes and collectively holds 33 1/3% of the voting power. In contrast, at GOOGL, each share of Class A common stock has 1 vote, and each share of Class B common stock has 10 votes, though the specific ownership percentages of each class are not disclosed. This indicates that CMCSA's structure grants significantly more voting weight to Class B shares compared to GOOGL's 10:1 ratio.",

      "question": "How does the voting power distribution tied to Class B common stock at CMCSA compare to GOOGL's dual-class structure, particularly in terms of the relative influence of holders of Class B shares?",
      "answer": "At CMCSA, holders of Class B common stock (owned entirely by Brian L. Roberts) have 15 votes per share and represent 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, while Class A common stockholders hold 66 2/3% of the voting power. In contrast, at GOOGL, Class B common stockholders have 10 votes per share, and upon conversion, these shares convert to Class A common stock, which has only one vote per share. This means that while both companies use a dual-class structure to concentrate voting power among certain shareholders, CMCSA\u2019s Class B shares carry more per-share voting weight (15 votes vs. 10 votes) and are non-dilutable, giving the holder a fixed minority voting control compared to GOOGL\u2019s structure, which allows for more fluidity through conversion.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class B Common Stock: GOOGL's Class B shares carry 10 votes per share and can convert to Class A shares with 1 vote each, indicating a structure designed to maintain concentrated voting control while allowing for eventual dilution.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: At CMCSA, Class B shares have 15 votes per share and represent 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, while Class A shares collectively hold the remaining 66 2/3%, showing a clear distinction in control mechanisms.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: CMCSA\u2019s Class A common stock is traded publicly and holds 66 2/3% of the voting power collectively, while Class B shares are held entirely by one individual, preserving long-term control."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nmay result in significant damages for contract breach, and other significant costs, penalties, and other liabilities, as well as harm to our reputation and market position.\n\nOther businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users' browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use personal information, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose personal information about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of member and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization, data transfer and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the ex tent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\n\n## Our reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if member personal information, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorized persons.\n\nWe maintain personal information regarding our members, including names, age, gender and billing information. This personal information is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. With respect to billing information, such as credit card numbers, we rely on encryption and authentication technology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members' information. Despite these measures and technologies we, our payment processing services or other third-party services we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members' information. In the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to remain or become members. We have notified and may in the future be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived data breach (including various state Attorneys General, one or more EU data protection authorities, or other data protection authorities) as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods. Additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. We also maintain personal information concerning our employees, as well as personal information of others working on our productions. Should an unauthorized intrusion into our members' or employees' personal information and/or production personal information occur, our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted.\n\n## Risks Related to Liquidity\n\n## The long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\n\nIn connection with licensing streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers. We also enter into multi-year commitments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these productions such as noncancelable commitments under talent agreements. The payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base ('fixed cost') but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical ex hibition receipts. Such commitments, to the ex tent estimable under accounting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if business performance does not meet our expectations, our margins may be adversely impacted. Further, we may be unable to react to any reduction in our cash flows from operations, including those caused by a downturn in the economy, by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not fund the production of such content. To the extent revenue growth does not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and largely fix ed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flex ibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offerings quickly and our results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\n## We may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. Rising interest rates or any disruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance",

We cannot predict the timing or outcome of these spectrum allocation actions. Additional commercial spectrum could impact current marketplace dynamics, including the ability of wireless providers to compete with our services. Further, if the FCC reallocates spectrum that our businesses currently use to provide services, we could be required to transition our operations to different frequencies in order to accommodate the reallocation of spectrum for 5G, which could disrupt our services and impose additional costs.\n\n## International Communications-Related and Other Regulations\n\nCertain of our international businesses are subject to telecommunications and media-specific regulation, including those related to broadband and voice services and television networks, in Europe, Latin America, and other international jurisdictions, and all of our international businesses are subject to regulation under generally applicable laws, such as competition, consumer protection, data protection, and taxation in the jurisdictions where they operate. Our international businesses are currently, and may be in the future, subject to proceedings or investigations from regulatory and antitrust authorities in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate.\n\n## Other Areas of Regulation\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nCopyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other proprietary-rights laws of the United States and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, unauthorized copying, distribution and piracy of programming and films over the internet, through devices, software and websites, counterfeit DVDs/Blu-rays and through other platforms interfere with the market for copyrighted works and present challenges for our content businesses. We have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to ex pend substantial resources to protect our content. Although many legal  protections  ex ist  to  combat  such  practices,  the  ex tent  of  copyright  protection  is  sometimes  ambiguous  and  the  use  of  technological  protections  can  be controversial. Modifications to existing laws, a weakening of these protections or their enforcement or a failure of ex isting laws, in the United States or internationally, to adapt to new technologies could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming.\n\nU.S. copyright laws establish a cable compulsory copyright license that requires our video distribution business to contribute a specified percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material included in broadcast signals. We also pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we create or distribute. The cable compulsory copyright license and the royalties we pay are subject to audits and possible regulatory and legislative changes that could impact the royalty fees we pay and our ability to retransmit broadcast signals over cable systems. In addition, the landscape for music licensing is constantly changing, and music fees we pay are subject to new fee demands and negotiations. We cannot predict how changes to the compulsory copyright license and music licensing will impact the fees that we pay.\n\n## Privacy and Data Protection Regulation\n\nOur businesses are subject to laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the processing of individuals' personal information. In the United States, federal privacy laws and regulations, such as those found within the Communications Act or the V ideo Privacy Protection Act, restrict companies' collection, use, disclosure and retention of personal information. The proliferation of laws at the state level has expanded consumers' rights to include individual rights of access, deletion, portability, correction, the right to appeal, and the individual's right to 'opt in' to collection and use of certain types of 'sensitive'  personal  information.  Internationally,  many  of  the  laws  that  apply  to  our  businesses  are  similar  to  the  European  Union's  G eneral  Data  Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom's Data Protection Act of 2018, which broadly regulate the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the European Union and United Kingdom, respectively.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Such events have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, a variety of adverse business impacts including degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, a reduction in demand for our products, services and theme parks, disruption of our internal systems, products, services or satellite transmission signals, power outages, and damage to our or our customers' or vendors' equipment and properties. These events also may result in lost revenue and large expenditures to repair or replace damaged properties, products and services and could lead to litigation and regulatory fines or remedial measures, including if we inadvertently contributed to damages suffered by others.\n\nThe amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from these types of events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. We expect that we will continue to experience some or all of these events in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such event will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.\n\n## The loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\n\nWe rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses.\n\nIn addition, our Content &amp; Experiences business depends on the abilities and expertise of on-air and creative talent. If we fail to attract or retain on-air or creative talent, if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially, or if these individuals cause negative publicity or lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adversely affected.\n\n## Labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses.\n\nMany of the writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel, as well as some on-air and creative talent employees in our  Content &amp;  Experiences business, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Many of these collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. For example, the Writers G uild of America ('Writers Guild') and the Screen Actors G uild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists ('SAG ') work stoppages in 2023 paused productions, which reduced content licensing revenue at our Studios segment. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages in the future.\n\nIn addition, labor disputes in sports organizations with which we have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\n\n## Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Governance Matters\n\nWe are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.\n\nOur businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and federal laws and regulations. In the United States in particular, the Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations affect significant aspects of our communications businesses.\n\nLegislators  and  regulators  at  all  levels  of  government  frequently  consider  changing,  and  sometimes  do  change,  ex isting  statutes,  rules  or  regulations,  or interpretations  of  ex isting  statutes,  rules  or  regulations,  or  prescribe  new  ones,  any  of  which  may  significantly  affect  our  businesses  and  ability  to  effectively compete. Applying existing laws in novel ways to new technologies, including streaming services and AI, may also affect our business. These legislators and regulators,  along  with  some  state  attorneys  general  and  foreign  governmental  authorities,  have  been  active  in  conducting  inquiries  and  reviews  regarding  our services. State legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different and/or conflicting state requirements, such as with respect to privacy and Open Internet/net neutrality regulations, that can affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "At CMCSA, Class B common stockholders hold no voting rights, as disclosed in their 2024 10-K filing, where 9,444,375 shares of Class B common stock were issued and outstanding. In contrast, META's Class A common stockholders have full voting rights on all matters, as outlined in the V_10k_2024 document. This indicates that while CMCSA's Class B shareholders have no influence over corporate decisions, META's Class A shareholders maintain full governance control.",

      "answer": "Alphabet's structure grants Class B common stockholders 10 votes per share, while Class A common stockholders receive one vote per share. In contrast, Comcast's Class B common stockholders hold 15 votes per share, with Class A common stockholders receiving a variable number of votes based on the outstanding shares of both classes, but capped at 66 2/3% of the total voting power for Class A shares. Meta's disclosure highlights that it issues Class A common stock, which likely carries one vote per share, suggesting a more balanced approach to shareholder influence compared to the weighted voting rights in Alphabet and Comcast structures.",

        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Alphabet's Class B common stockholders have 10 votes per share, compared to one vote per share for Class A stockholders, indicating a significant disparity in voting influence.",

        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 META: Meta's disclosure of its Class A common stock suggests a structure where voting rights are more evenly distributed, as Class A shares likely carry one vote each, contrasting with the concentrated voting power in Alphabet and Comcast."

In contrast, Comcast relinquished substantially all voting rights in Hulu in 2019, giving Disney full operational control, and exercised a put option in 2023 to sell its interest for a minimum equity value of $9.2 billion.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairo s as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. Certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf are accounted for as advances and classified within other investments. Atairos may pledge our remaining unfunded capital commitment as security to lenders in connection with certain financing arrangements.  This has no effect on our funding commitments. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n\nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made cash capital contributions totaling $73 million, $145 million, and $52 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment, inclusive of advances classified within other investments, was $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.\n\n## Hulu and Collateralized Obligation\n\nIn  2019,  we  entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  with  The  Walt  Disney  Company  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries,  whereby  we  relinquished  our  board  seats  and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. Concurrent with these agreements, we also acquired additional ownership interest in Hulu previously held by AT&amp;T. Following these transactions, our interest was approximately 33% and we had the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of future equity capital calls. The agreements included put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we could require Disney to buy, and Disney could require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu. In the third quarter of 2023, we amended these agreements and agreed, among other things, that the put/call provisions regarding our interest could be exercised in November 2023 (in addition to subsequent periods) and that we would fund our share of prior equity capital calls if the put/call was ex ercised in November 2023.\n\nIn November 2023, we exercised our put right requiring Disney to purchase our interest in Hulu. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Disney paid us $8.6 billion, representing $9.2 billion for our share of Hulu's minimum equity value, less $557 million for our share of prior capital calls. Additional proceeds for any ex cess of the fair value of our interest over the $9.2 billion minimum equity value will be due following final determination of Hulu's fair value pursuant to a third-party appraisal process. In connection with the transaction, Disney also agreed to share with us 50% of the future tax benefits resulting from the purchase of our interest in Hulu. Because we continue to hold our interest in Hulu, the $9.2 billion payment from Disney is treated as an advance on the sale of our interest, which will be recognized following the finalization of the appraisal process. The receipt of the minimum proceeds resulted in a tax gain in 2023. The recorded value of our investment in Hulu of $883 million and $863 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, continues to reflect our historical cost in applying the equity method, and therefore, is less than its fair value.\n\nIn 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility, which was fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. The term loan was due at the earlier of March 2024 or upon receipt of the proceeds under the put/call provisions and was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe present the advance on the sale of our  investment  and  the  term  loan  separately  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  in  the  captions  'advance  on  sale  of investment' and 'collateralized obligation,' respectively.\n\n## Marketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify investments with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as marketable equity securities and the carrying values are primarily presented in other current assets. The changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities between measurement dates are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The fair values of our marketable equity securities are based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market prices.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "GOOGL's ownership of CMCSA Class B common stock would have limited influence over CMCSA's corporate governance decisions because Class B shares only have voting rights in specific cases like mergers or amendments to the certificate of incorporation, and even then, votes are calculated based on a conversion rate. CMCSA's Class A shareholders, not Class B, hold general voting rights, and GOOGL\u2019s Class B stake would only participate under defined circumstances. Additionally, GOOGL\u2019s own share repurchases in 2024 focused on Class A and Class C shares, not Class B, which suggests limited strategic emphasis on controlling-vote structures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class A Common Stock: CMCSA issued 4,651,093,045 shares of Class A common stock in 2024, each with one vote, indicating majority voting control lies with Class A shareholders.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Class B common stock has no general voting rights and only participates in limited corporate actions like mergers or charter amendments, with voting power tied to a conversion rate, reducing influence compared to Class A.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 GOOGL: GOOGL maintains a dual-class structure where Class B shares carry 10 votes each but has repurchased $62.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares in 2024, suggesting a strategic focus on liquidity rather than consolidating control through high-vote shares."

      "answer": "Slack's 2019 securities litigation involved seven class action lawsuits alleging violations related to its registration statement, with the federal case ultimately dismissed with prejudice by the Ninth Circuit on February 10, 2025. Meanwhile, META faces ongoing FTC scrutiny through a 2023 administrative proceeding seeking sweeping changes to its 2020 consent order, including restrictions on minors' data use and board composition, with a ruling pending from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals after oral arguments in November 2024. GOOGL competes with Slack (owned by Salesforce) in the enterprise communication and connectivity products market. The resolution of Slack\u2019s litigation reduces its legal overhang, potentially strengthening its competitive posture, while META\u2019s unresolved FTC challenges could constrain its product development and data usage strategies, indirectly benefiting GOOGL in the broader enterprise ecosystem.",

Legal Proceedings and Claims\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is or may be involved in various legal or regulatory proceedings, claims or purported class actions related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour and other claims. The Company has been, and may in the future be, put on notice or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement.\n\nIn general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Company's financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Company's reputation and future operating results.\n\nThe Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. The outcomes of legal proceedings and other contingencies are, however, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. At this time, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible losses in excess of any amounts accrued, including losses that could arise as a result of application of non-monetary remedies, with respect to the contingencies it faces, and the Company's estimates may not prove to be accurate.\n\nIn management's opinion, resolution of all current matters, including those described below, is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial statements. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, payment or other contingency, the resolution of a matter could materially affect the Company's current or future results of operations or cash flows, or both, in a particular quarter.\n\n## Slack Litigation\n\nBeginning in September 2019, seven purported class action lawsuits were filed against Slack, its directors, certain of its officers and certain investment funds associated with certain of its directors, each alleging violations of securities laws in connection with Slack's registration statement on Form S-1 (the 'Registration Statement') filed with the SEC. All but one of these actions were filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Mateo, though one plaintiff originally filed in the County of San Francisco before refiling in the County of San Mateo (and the original San Francisco action was dismissed). The remaining action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the 'Federal Action'). In the Federal Action, captioned Dennee v. Slack Technologies, Inc., Case No. 3:19-CV-05857-SI, Slack and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in January 2020. In April 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. In May 2020, Slack and the other defendants filed a motion to certify the court's order for interlocutory appeal, which the court granted. Slack and the other defendants filed a petition for permission to appeal the district court's order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which was granted in July 2020. Oral argument was heard in May 2021. On September 20, 2021, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling. Slack filed a petition for rehearing with the Ninth Circuit on November 3, 2021, which was denied on May 2, 2022. Slack filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on August 31, 2022, which was granted on December 13, 2022. On June 1, 2023, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision vacating the Ninth Circuit's decision and remanded for further proceedings. The Ninth Circuit ordered the parties to submit additional briefing in light of the Supreme Court's decision. On February 10, 2025, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court's order and instructing the district court to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. The state court actions were consolidated in November 2019, and the consolidated action is captioned In re Slack Technologies, Inc. Shareholder Litigation, Lead Case No. 19CIV05370 (the 'State Court Action'). An additional state court action was filed in San Mateo County in June 2020 but was consolidated with the State Court Action in July 2020. Slack and the other defendants filed demurrers to the complaint in the State Court Action in February 2020. In August 2020, the court sustained in part and overruled in part the demurrers, and granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint, which they filed in October 2020. Slack and the other defendants answered the complaint in November 2020. Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on October 21, 2021, which remains pending. On October 26, 2022, the court stayed the State Court Action pending resolution of Slack's petition for a writ of certiorari in the Federal Action. The State Court Action remains stayed pending resolution of the appellate proceedings in the Federal Action.

We entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiries and litigation and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us to additional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business. On June 1, 2023, the court presiding over the lawsuit filed by the District of Columbia granted our motion for summary judgment, resolving the case in our favor. On June 29, 2023, the District of Columbia filed a notice of appeal. The appeal is fully briefed and will be heard on January 30, 2025. Trial in the New Mexico Attorney G eneral's case is scheduled to begin on December 1, 2025. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc. Derivative Litigation . On January 19, 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10, 2023. The insider trading claim was dismissed as to all defendants except Mark Zuckerberg, and the motion was denied as to the breach of fiduciary duty claims. Trial is scheduled to begin on April 2, 2025.\n\nOn May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding ( In the Matter of Facebook, Inc. ) seeking substantial changes to the modified consent order, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a proposed order and include,  among others,  a  prohibition  on  our  use  of  minors'  data  for  any  commercial  purposes,  changes  to  the  composition  of  our  board  of  directors,  and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( USA v. Facebook, Inc. ) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent order. On November 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ( U.S. v. Facebook, Inc. ) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding pending resolution of the appeal. Our motion for a stay pending appeal was denied in March 2024. The underlying appeal was then briefed and oral argument was held on November 5, 2024. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has yet to rule.\n\nOn November 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC ),  asserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On December 13, 2023, the FTC filed an opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 14, 2024, the district court denied our motion to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation, and also denied the FTC's motion to dismiss our complaint without prejudice, pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in SEC v. Jarkesy ( Jarkesy ). Our motion for a stay of the FTC proceeding pending appeal was denied in March 2024. Both the district court action and the appeal were stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in Jarkesy . Following the Supreme Court's ruling in Jarkesy on June 27, 2024, the government filed a renewed motion to dismiss, which was fully briefed as of October 18, 2024. The district court has yet to rule. The parties are required to report back to the circuit court within 30 days of the district court's disposition of the FTC's motion to dismiss.\n\nOn April 1, 2024, we filed our response to the FTC's Order to Show Cause, arguing, among other things, that the Order to Show Cause proceeding was legally improper. Per FTC orders, we completed briefing on threshold legal issues on July 18, 2024, and the FTC held oral argument before the Commissioners on those issues on November 12, 2024. On January 10, 2025, the Commission issued a decision on certain threshold legal issues, including that the Commission has statutory authority to modify consent orders. The Commission stated that its decision is subject to Meta's jurisdictional challenges currently pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in U.S. v. Facebook, Inc. , and that the nature and scope of any further administrative proceedings would be addressed at a later date. Through the administrative process, the FTC could amend the order to impose the additional requirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the opportunity to appeal an FTC decision modifying the order and could request the appellate court to stay the enforcement of the modifications to the order while the appeal is pending. It is unclear whether the appeal or the request for a stay would be successful.\n\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, issue similar notifications to European regulators under",

Counterparty credit risk, which is mitigated by master netting agreements and collateral posting arrangements with certain counterparties, had an impact on derivative fair value estimates that was not material. The Company's derivative financial instruments are discussed in Note 17.\n\nLevel 2 other liabilities are primarily arrangements that are valued based on the fair value of underlying investments, which are generally measured using Level 1 and Level 2 fair value techniques.\n\nLevel 2 borrowings, which include commercial paper, U.S. dollar denominated notes and certain foreign currency denominated borrowings, are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or identical instruments in markets that are not active.\n\nLevel 3 borrowings include the Asia Theme Park borrowings, which are valued based on the current borrowing cost and credit risk of the Asia Theme Parks as well as prevailing market interest rates.\n\nThe Company's financial instruments also include cash, cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate the fair values.\n\n## Non-recurring Fair Value Measure\n\nThe Company also has assets that may be required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are evaluated when certain triggering events occur (including a decrease in estimated future cash flows) that indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges as disclosed in Notes 4 and 18.

Counterparty credit risk, which is mitigated by master netting agreements and collateral posting arrangements with certain counterparties, had an impact on derivative fair value estimates that was not material. The Company's derivative financial instruments are discussed in Note 17.\n\nLevel 2 other liabilities are primarily arrangements that are valued based on the fair value of underlying investments, which are generally measured using Level 1 and Level 2 fair value techniques.\n\nLevel 2 borrowings, which include commercial paper, U.S. dollar denominated notes and certain foreign currency denominated borrowings, are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or identical instruments in markets that are not active.\n\nLevel 3 borrowings include the Asia Theme Park borrowings, which are valued based on the current borrowing cost and credit risk of the Asia Theme Parks as well as prevailing market interest rates.\n\nThe Company's financial instruments also include cash, cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate the fair values.\n\n## Non-recurring Fair Value Measure\n\nThe Company also has assets that may be required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are evaluated when certain triggering events occur (including a decrease in estimated future cash flows) that indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges as disclosed in Notes 4 and 18.

Land  and  assets  held  within construction in progress (CIP) are not depreciated. CIP assets are related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. We also capitalize interest on our debt related to certain eligible CIP assets and depreciate over the useful life of the related assets.\n\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.\n\n## Lease Obligations\n\nOur operating leases mostly comprise of certain data centers, offices, and colocations. We also have finance leases for certain network infrastructure. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception and most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed payments for maintenance, utilities, real estate tax es, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. These amounts are affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on energy production for renewable energy purchase arrangements, and maintenance and utilities.  Such variable lease costs are ex pensed as incurred on our consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities.\n\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.\n\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determining the probability  of  ex ercising  such  options,  we  consider  contract-based,  asset-based,  entity-based,  and  market-based  factors.  We  do  not  assume  renewals  in  our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar economic environment.\n\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded net impairment losses of $383 million, $2.43 billion, and $2.22 billion, respectively, in aggregate for operating lease ROU assets and leasehold improvements under ASC Topic 360 as a part of our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts. The fair values of the impaired assets were estimated using discounted cash flow models (income approach) based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs. The assumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining  lease  periods,  and  discount  rates  that  reflect  the  level  of  risk  associated  with  receiving  future  cash  flows.

      "answer": "CMCSA uses sensitivity analyses to assess its exposure to interest rate risk, which is critical given its reliance on derivative instruments like interest rate swaps that decreased consolidated interest expense by $56 million in 2023. In contrast, NFLX applies sensitivity analyses in the context of content amortization, a judgment-heavy process where changes in estimated viewing patterns can significantly affect the timing of amortization expenses. Both companies rely on the same auditor, who has served NFLX since 2012 and also reviews CMCSA\u2019s market risk disclosures, suggesting a consistent audit approach despite the differing applications and financial impacts of sensitivity analyses at each firm.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Sensitivity Analyses: CMCSA uses sensitivity analyses to monitor interest rate risk associated with its derivative instruments, which significantly impacted consolidated interest expense (e.g., $56 million decrease in 2023).",
        "Hop 2: Sensitivity Analyses \u2192 Auditor: The same auditor performs sensitivity analyses in both companies\u2019 audits, as seen in NFLX\u2019s audit where sensitivity testing is used to evaluate the impact of assumptions in content amortization models.",

      "answer": "AT&T's pension obligations are sensitive to discount rates derived from corporate bonds' credit quality, which directly affects the measurement of $67,854 million in goodwill and postretirement liabilities. Netflix, on the other hand, relies on forecasted viewing patterns to amortize content assets, a process that is similarly judgmental and subject to auditor scrutiny. Both companies' financial statements depend heavily on significant assumptions\u2014discount rates for AT&T and viewing forecasts for Netflix\u2014that are evaluated by auditors using sensitivity analyses and comparisons to historical data. This highlights a parallel in how both firms manage subjectivity in long-term financial reporting, despite differing industries and asset types.",

      "answer": "At META, Class B common stock has significantly higher voting power compared to Class A common stock. Specifically, each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 15 votes, while the voting power of Class A shares fluctuates depending on total shares outstanding, but collectively, Class A holders have 66 2/3% of the voting power and Class B holders have 33 1/3%. This is similar to GOOGL, where Class B shares have 10 votes per share and Class A shares have 1 vote per share. The structure at META is further complicated by the fact that Class B shares are convertible into Class A shares, either voluntarily or upon transfer, which could shift the overall voting power distribution over time.",

      "answer": "CMCSA disclosed that it issued 4,651,093,045 Class A common shares and 9,444,375 Class B common shares as of December 31, 2024, indicating a significantly higher proportion of Class A shares in its equity structure. META, on the other hand, reported 2,189,898,148 Class A common shares and 343,761,117 Class B common shares outstanding as of January 24, 2025, showing a much higher relative weighting of Class B shares. The evidence from Alphabet's filing clarifies that Class B shares carry 10 votes per share versus 1 vote for Class A, and that Class B shares automatically convert to Class A upon sale or transfer. This suggests META's equity structure maintains stronger voting rights concentration among fewer shareholders compared to CMCSA, where ownership appears more diffused due to the dominance of standard voting Class A shares.",

      "question": "How does the voting power distribution tied to Class A and Class B common stock structures at Comcast Corporation impact the governance influence of shareholders holding Class B shares compared to Meta's Class A shareholder base, given the convertibility feature of Comcast's Class B stock?",
      "answer": "At Comcast Corporation, holders of Class B common stock possess 33 1/3% of the total voting power, with each share entitled to 15 votes, and these shares are convertible on a share-for-share basis into Class A common stock. This structure ensures Class B shareholders retain significant governance influence, even though their ownership stake may be smaller in volume. In contrast, Meta's Class A common stockholders, who hold 2,189,898,148 shares outstanding, represent the majority voting class, with no disclosed dual-class structure or convertibility mechanism. The presence of a defined convertibility path at Comcast allows for potential shifts in voting control, whereas Meta\u2019s governance structure remains more static with its Class A shareholders holding dominant voting authority.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: META \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Meta discloses that it has 2,189,898,148 shares of Class A common stock outstanding, which carries voting rights and dominates the shareholder base with no dual-class convertibility mechanism.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Comcast\u2019s Class B common stock has 33 1/3% of the total voting power, with each share carrying 15 votes, and is convertible into Class A common stock on a one-to-one basis, preserving its voting influence and offering structural flexibility.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: Comcast disclosed that Class B common stock is issued and outstanding at 9,444,375 shares, with specific voting rights and convertibility, which shapes the governance influence of its holders relative to Class A shareholders."

Disney (DIS) owns Pixar, an asset reflected in its indefinite-lived intangible assets, and leverages Pixar's intellectual property to strengthen its DTC platform.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ntelevision  and  the  internet.  Our  home  service  group  performs  various  tasks,  including  installations,  servicing  and  upgrades  of customer premise equipment. Customers can use self-service help and support and perform self-installations for certain services.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete with a broad range of companies engaged in media, entertainment and communications services in Europe. For video services,  we  compete  with  cable  operators,  providers  of  both  paid-for  and  free-to-air  programming,  other  satellite  television providers, digital terrestrial television providers, content aggregators, home entertainment products companies, and other suppliers and providers of sports, entertainment, news and information that deliver DTC and other OTT streaming services. For broadband and wireless services, we compete with service providers making use of new fiber-optic networks, telecommunications providers, other  internet  service  providers  and  companies  developing  new  technologies  and  devices.  Our  competitive  position  may  be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of, or developments in, the means of delivery competitors use to provide their services as well as lowered prices, product innovations, new technologies or different value creation approaches. We also compete with organizations that are publicly funded, in whole or in part, to fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate.\n\nOur owned channels compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other television networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost for such content is significant.\n\nWe compete for the  sale  of  advertising  with  other  television  networks  and  stations,  digital  platforms,  and  all  other  advertising platforms. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from  us  may  be  adversely  affected  by  declines  in  television  viewership  and  the  increasing  number  of  entertainment  choices available.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, including Sky Glass and XClass TV, which launched in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sky Glass and XClass TV are smart televisions with operating systems that leverage our global technology platforms similar to Sky Q, X1 and Flex. We sell Sky Glass televisions in Europe, with the United Kingdom as the first market, to consumers that also subscribe to Sky's video services. XClass TVs are manufactured and sold by third parties and operate on our XClass TV operating system.\n\n## Seasonality and Cyclicality\n\nEach of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Cable Communications' results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year.\n\nRevenue  and  operating  costs  and  expenses  (comprised  of  total  costs  and  expenses,  excluding  depreciation  and  amortization expense) in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees.\n\nRevenue in Cable Communications, Media and Sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the United States is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season, and advertising related  to  candidates  running  for  political  office  and  issue-oriented  advertising,  respectively.  Revenue  in  Media  also  fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. Advertising revenue in Sky typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition in the summer during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup . TM\n\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms, including viewing on demand, DTC platforms or OTT service providers. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. We incur",

      "question": "Given that META's Class B common stockholders have limited voting rights on specific corporate actions, and CMCSA's Class A common stock is the primary voting share class, how might the ownership structure of 343,761,117 outstanding Class B shares at META affect the potential for shareholder-driven governance changes compared to CMCSA's 3,778,302,017 outstanding Class A shares?",
      "answer": "META's Class B common stockholders, of which there are 343,761,117 outstanding shares, possess limited voting rights, only applicable in specific corporate actions such as exiting the core payments business or certain mergers. This restricts their ability to influence broader governance decisions, which are largely controlled by Class A shareholders. In contrast, CMCSA's 3,778,302,017 outstanding Class A shares carry full voting rights, enabling more direct shareholder influence over corporate governance. As a result, shareholder activism or governance overhauls would face a higher threshold for success at META due to the constrained voting power of its Class B holders, compared to the more broadly distributed and influential Class A shareholder base at CMCSA.",

        "Hop 1: META \u2192 Class B Common Stock: META has 343,761,117 Class B shares outstanding, which have limited voting rights only in defined corporate actions.",

      "answer": "AT&T's Series B Preferred Stockholders have no voting rights except on specific merger-related matters where they can vote as a single class with each holder casting votes equal to the number of shares held. This contrasts with Netflix, where each share of common stock provides one vote on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders, giving common stockholders broader governance influence. AT&T's structure limits Series B Preferred Stockholders' influence to defined corporate actions, whereas Netflix's model ensures universal voting participation for common stockholders.",

Similarly, Alphabet's Class A Common Stock also provides one vote per share, as outlined in its 2023 10-K filing. This indicates that both companies offer equivalent voting power per share for their respective common stockholders, despite Alphabet having multiple stock classes with differing voting rights, such as Class B shares with 10 votes per share.",

      "question": "How does the governance risk associated with META's dual-class structure, particularly its impact on investor confidence in Class A common stock, contrast with CMCSA's equity structure that includes Class B common stock but lacks a conversion mechanism tied to governance restrictions?",
      "answer": "CMCSA's equity structure includes 9,444,375 issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock as of 2023, but unlike META, there is no indication that CMCSA ties governance rights or stock conversion to special investor restrictions. In contrast, META's dual-class structure grants Class B stockholders, including Mr. Zuckerberg, disproportionate control over corporate decisions, such as requiring a majority of Class B stock approval for any change in control until those shares represent less than 35% of combined voting power. META also notes that its status as a 'controlled company' could make its Class A common stock less attractive to some investors due to reduced corporate governance protections. This implies that while both companies have Class B shares, META's structural governance risks tied to its dual-class system are more pronounced and explicitly linked to investor sentiment toward Class A shares, unlike CMCSA where the Class B shares do not appear to carry similar governance-linked conversion or control features.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class B Common Stock: CMCSA discloses 9,444,375 issued and outstanding Class B shares, but does not link them to governance control or conversion rights.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Mastercard\u2019s Class B shares convert to Class A on a one-to-one basis, but holders must sell Class A shares post-conversion, indicating a structural separation of ownership and governance.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 META: META\u2019s Class A shares are negatively impacted by its controlled company status and dual-class structure, which could make them less attractive to some investors due to lack of governance protections."

      "question": "How does the voting power structure of META's Class A common stock compare to CMCSA's dual-class stock framework, particularly in terms of control concentration when Class B shares represent less than 35% of combined voting power?",
      "answer": "In META's case, if Class B shares fall below 35% of combined voting power, certain corporate actions still require majority Class B approval, while CMCSA's framework grants Class A shareholders 66 2/3% of the voting power with each Class B share carrying 15 votes and representing 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, creating a more stable control structure under CMCSA's non-dilutable Class B provisions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: META \u2192 Class A Common Stock: META's Class A common stock is negatively impacted by its controlled company status, where Class B shareholders retain outsized control through dual-class voting rights, and corporate actions may require Class B approval even when their ownership is below 50%.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Both META and CMCSA maintain dual-class structures where Class B shares carry significantly more voting power than Class A shares, but the thresholds and permanence of control differ, with CMCSA explicitly stating Class B's 33 1/3% non-dilutable voting power.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: CMCSA's Class B common stock is structured so that it maintains 33 1/3% of the combined voting power with 15 votes per share, and is non-dilutable under the articles of incorporation, providing Brian L. Roberts continued influence over corporate decisions."

      "question": "How does the voting power disparity between Class A and Class B common stock at GOOGL compare to the uniform voting rights structure at NFLX, particularly in relation to the $62.2 billion in Class A and Class C shares repurchased by GOOGL in 2023?",
      "answer": "GOOGL maintains a multi-tiered voting rights structure where Class A common stockholders receive one vote per share, while Class B common stockholders receive ten votes per share, contributing to concentrated voting control. In 2023, GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares, which may reduce the number of shares outstanding without diluting the voting power of existing Class B holders. In contrast, NFLX provides uniform voting rights, with each share of common stock entitling the holder to one vote per share on all matters. This difference highlights a structural divergence in corporate governance, with GOOGL preserving a weighted voting system and NFLX adopting an egalitarian voting model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class A Common Stock: GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion in Class A and Class C shares in 2023, which affects equity distribution but not voting control since Class B shares hold more voting power.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Voting Rights: Class A shares grant one vote per share, while Class B shares (not repurchased) have 10 votes per share, creating a disparity in voting power.",
        "Hop 3: Voting Rights \u2190 NFLX: NFLX provides one vote per share to all common stockholders, contrasting with GOOGL\u2019s multi-tiered voting rights structure."

The primary risk managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and inv estment in foreign subsidiaries will be adv ersely affected by foreign  currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations.  We  also  enter  into  deriv ativ e  instruments  to  partially  offset  our  exposure  to  other  risks  and  enhance inv estment returns.\n\nWe recognize deriv ativ e instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair v alue and classify the deriv ativ es primarily within Lev el 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair v alues and present all other deriv ativ es at gross fair v alues. T he accounting treatment for deriv ativ es is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nWe  designate  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  (including  collars)  as  cash  flow  hedges  to  hedge  certain  forecasted  rev enue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts hav e maturities of 24 months or less.\n\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiv eness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to rev enue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time v alue from our assessment of hedge effectiv eness and amortize them on a straight-line basis ov er the life of the hedging instrument in rev enues. T he difference between fair v alue changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to rev enues is recorded in AOCI.\n\nAs  of December 31, 2024,  the  net  accumulated  gain  on  our  foreign  currency  cash  flow  hedges  before  tax  effect  was  $731  million,  which  is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into rev enues within the next 12 months.\n\n## Fair Value Hedges\n\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair v alue hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair v alue hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiv eness are recognized in OI&amp;E, along with the  offsetting  gains  and  losses  of  the  related  hedged  items.  We  exclude  forward  points  from  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiv eness  and  recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&amp;E.\n\n## Net Investment Hedges\n\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net inv estment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our inv estment in foreign subsidiaries. Net inv estment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiv eness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiv eness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&amp;E.\n\n## Other Derivatives\n\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to hedge intercompany transactions and  other  monetary  assets  or  liabilities  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  functional  currency  of  a  subsidiary.  Gains  and  losses  on  these deriv ativ es that are not designated as accounting hedges are primarily recorded in OI&amp;E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities.\n\nWe also use deriv ativ es not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, commodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns.  From time to time, we enter into deriv ativ es to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other deriv ativ es are primarily reflected within the 'other' component of OI&amp;E. See Note 7 for further details.",

In contrast, Comcast's Class B shares hold 33\u2153% of voting power that is non-dilutable and convertible share-for-share into Class A, preserving a fixed level of control for Class B holders regardless of share issuance.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. The impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a market approach and an income approach) to its carrying amount. As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, an impairment charge of $5.8 billion in the Business reporting unit was recorded during the year. Auditing management's goodwill impairment test was complex and highly judgmental due to the inherent subjectivity of developing an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit, which is based on assumptions about future conditions, transactions, or events whose outcome is uncertain and will therefore be subject to change over time. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions such as the |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit   | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill impairment review process.

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                 | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. |\n| We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                 | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process.

We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate.

      "answer": "CMCSA's Class B common stock, which is entirely owned by Brian L. Roberts, holds 33\u2153% of the combined voting power, with each share carrying 15 votes. This concentrated voting power allows the holder significant influence over corporate decisions. Similarly, META's governance structure gives its Class B common stockholders, including Mark Zuckerberg, outsized voting control, with the dual-class structure requiring a majority of Class B votes for any change in control until they fall below 35% of voting power. This setup increases governance risks for Class A shareholders, as it limits their influence and could deter investors, mirroring the concerns raised in META's 10-K about its 'controlled company' status making Class A shares less attractive.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class B Common Stock: CMCSA discloses that Brian L. Roberts owns all 9,444,375 shares of Class B common stock, which carry 15 votes per share and represent 33\u2153% of the combined voting power.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: The Class B shares have significantly more voting power per share than Class A shares, giving the holder outsized influence over corporate governance and decisions.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 META: META acknowledges that its dual-class structure, where Class B shares have more voting rights, makes its Class A common stock less attractive to some investors due to reduced governance influence and potential takeover protections."

      "answer": "Disney's VAR model excludes forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable/payable denominated in foreign currencies, which means its risk analysis does not account for potential volatility in these areas. In contrast, Netflix actively hedges its forecasted revenue transactions denominated in foreign currencies using forward contracts, directly managing its exposure to foreign exchange risk. This difference in approach means that while Disney's risk modeling may underestimate exposure from future foreign currency cash flows, Netflix explicitly mitigates such risk, potentially leading to more stable financial outcomes in volatile currency environments.",

        "Hop 1: DIS \u2192 VAR Model: Disney discloses that it uses a VAR model to estimate one-day maximum potential losses, but explicitly excludes forecasted transactions and foreign-denominated receivables/payables from the model.",

      "answer": "Disney's ESPN receives fees from Hulu for the right to air its networks, as noted in the elimination section of Disney's 2024 financials. This relationship is central to Hulu's content costs and revenue model. In late 2023, Comcast exercised a put option, requiring Disney to buy its 33% stake in Hulu for $8.6 billion, which included a $9.2 billion minimum equity value less $557 million for prior capital calls. This payment reflects the financial value derived from Comcast\u2019s stake in Hulu, which is partially driven by revenue streams like those from ESPN content licensing fees. Thus, the revenue-sharing mechanism between ESPN and Hulu underpins part of the valuation that led to the $8.6 billion payment to Comcast.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairo s as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. Certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf are accounted for as advances and classified within other investments. Atairos may pledge our remaining unfunded capital commitment as security to lenders in connection with certain financing arrangements.  This has no effect on our funding commitments. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n\nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made cash capital contributions totaling $73 million, $145 million, and $52 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment, inclusive of advances classified within other investments, was $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.\n\n## Hulu and Collateralized Obligation\n\nIn  2019,  we  entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  with  The  Walt  Disney  Company  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries,  whereby  we  relinquished  our  board  seats  and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. Concurrent with these agreements, we also acquired additional ownership interest in Hulu previously held by AT&amp;T. Following these transactions, our interest was approximately 33% and we had the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of future equity capital calls. The agreements included put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we could require Disney to buy, and Disney could require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu. In the third quarter of 2023, we amended these agreements and agreed, among other things, that the put/call provisions regarding our interest could be exercised in November 2023 (in addition to subsequent periods) and that we would fund our share of prior equity capital calls if the put/call was ex ercised in November 2023.\n\nIn November 2023, we exercised our put right requiring Disney to purchase our interest in Hulu. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Disney paid us $8.6 billion, representing $9.2 billion for our share of Hulu's minimum equity value, less $557 million for our share of prior capital calls. Additional proceeds for any ex cess of the fair value of our interest over the $9.2 billion minimum equity value will be due following final determination of Hulu's fair value pursuant to a third-party appraisal process. In connection with the transaction, Disney also agreed to share with us 50% of the future tax benefits resulting from the purchase of our interest in Hulu. Because we continue to hold our interest in Hulu, the $9.2 billion payment from Disney is treated as an advance on the sale of our interest, which will be recognized following the finalization of the appraisal process. The receipt of the minimum proceeds resulted in a tax gain in 2023. The recorded value of our investment in Hulu of $883 million and $863 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, continues to reflect our historical cost in applying the equity method, and therefore, is less than its fair value.\n\nIn 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility, which was fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. The term loan was due at the earlier of March 2024 or upon receipt of the proceeds under the put/call provisions and was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe present the advance on the sale of our  investment  and  the  term  loan  separately  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  in  the  captions  'advance  on  sale  of investment' and 'collateralized obligation,' respectively.\n\n## Marketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify investments with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as marketable equity securities and the carrying values are primarily presented in other current assets. The changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities between measurement dates are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The fair values of our marketable equity securities are based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market prices.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How do the differentiated voting rights structures for Class A Common Stock at Alphabet compare to Comcast's disclosure of Class A Common Stock, and what implications might this have for minority shareholder influence in corporate governance decisions?",
      "answer": "Alphabet's Certificate of Incorporation explicitly defines differentiated voting rights across its Class A, B, and C common stock, where only Class A shareholders have full voting rights, and Classes B and C are restricted except for specific corporate actions like mergers or amendments affecting their terms. In contrast, Comcast's 2023 filing only discloses Class A Common Stock without specifying any differentiated voting rights or structural limitations. This suggests Alphabet maintains a more complex multi-class governance framework that could concentrate voting power among Class A shareholders, whereas Comcast's simpler structure may imply more uniform shareholder influence, assuming no additional undisclosed classifications. Investors evaluating governance risk might view Alphabet as having higher entrenchment risk due to concentrated voting control.",

      "answer": "The $2.8 billion upfront payment from Vertical Bridge REIT, LLC is primarily recorded by VZ as 'Other liabilities' and treated as a financing obligation, with $830 million specifically reflected as a financing obligation related to the towers VZ continues to use. This affects VZ's balance sheet by increasing long-term liabilities while retaining the towers as Property, Plant, and Equipment, net. In contrast, NFLX's reliance on exclusive content rights involves no direct real estate or infrastructure assets but introduces risk related to licensing costs and potential withdrawal of content, which could increase operating expenses or reduce service differentiation. While VZ monetizes infrastructure through exclusive rights transfers, NFLX depends on exclusive content rights to drive subscriber growth and retention, highlighting divergent asset management strategies\u2014physical infrastructure monetization vs. intangible content licensing.",

Leasing Arrangements\n\nWe enter into  various  lease  arrangements  for  network  equipment  including  towers,  distributed  antenna  systems,  small  cells,  real  estate  and  connectivity mediums including dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations. Our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 1 year to 30 years, some of which include options that we can elect to extend the leases term for up to 25 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases. For the majority of leases entered into during the current period, we have concluded it is not reasonably certain that we would exercise the options to extend the lease or not terminate the lease. Therefore, as of the lease commencement date, our lease terms generally do not include these options. We include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\n\nDuring December 2024, we completed a transaction with V ertical Bridge REIT , LLC (V ertical Bridge) pursuant to which V ertical Bridge obtained the exclusive rights  to  lease,  operate  and  manage  over 6,000  wireless  towers  from  V erizon  in  exchange  for  an  upfront  payment  of  $2.8  billion.  Under  the  terms  of  the agreement, Vertical Bridge has exclusive rights to lease, operate and manage the towers over an average term of approximately 30 years, with the option to acquire the towers at the end of the lease terms. We have leased back a portion of the capacity on the towers from V ertical Bridge for an initial term of 10 years, with eight optional renewal terms of five years each, subject to certain early termination rights. W e continue to include the towers in Property , plant and equipment, net  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  depreciate  them  accordingly .  The  upfront  payment,  which  is  primarily  included  within  Other  liabilities  on  our consolidated balance sheet, is accounted for as prepaid rent and as a financing obligation. We recorded prepaid rent of $2.0 billion related to the portion of the towers for which the right-of-use has passed to V ertical Bridge, which is reflected in Cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, we recorded a financing obligation of $830 million related to the portion of the towers that we continue to occupy and use for network operations, which is reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nDuring M arch 2015, we completed a transaction with A merican T ower Corporation (A merican T ower) pursuant to which A merican T ower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American T ower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates in 2015, with options to renew. We continue to include the towers in Property , plant and equipment, net in our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly.\n\nIn addition to the rights to lease and operate the towers, V ertical Bridge and A merican T ower assumed the interest in the underlying ground leases related to these towers. While V ertical Bridge and A merican T ower can renegotiate the terms of and are responsible for paying the ground leases, we are still the primary obligor for these leases and accordingly , the present value of these ground leases are included in our operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities. W e do not expect to be required to make ground lease payments unless V ertical Bridge or A merican T ower defaults, which we determined to be remote.\n\nThe components of net lease cost were as follows:\n\n",

We recorded prepaid rent of $2.0 billion related to the portion of the towers for which the right-of-use has passed to V ertical Bridge, which is reflected in Cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, we recorded a financing obligation of $830 million related to the portion of the towers that we continue to occupy and use for network operations, which is reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nDuring M arch 2015, we completed a transaction with A merican T ower Corporation (A merican T ower) pursuant to which A merican T ower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American T ower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates in 2015, with options to renew. We continue to include the towers in Property , plant and equipment, net in our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly.\n\nIn addition to the rights to lease and operate the towers, V ertical Bridge and A merican T ower assumed the interest in the underlying ground leases related to these towers. While V ertical Bridge and A merican T ower can renegotiate the terms of and are responsible for paying the ground leases, we are still the primary obligor for these leases and accordingly , the present value of these ground leases are included in our operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities. W e do not expect to be required to make ground lease payments unless V ertical Bridge or A merican T ower defaults, which we determined to be remote.\n\nThe components of net lease cost were as follows:\n\n",

The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to ex pose us to greater distribution ex penses in certain markets.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright, and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\n## Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology, business processes, and content.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and consumer products,",

Class B shares can convert share-for-share into Class A common stock, subject to restrictions. In contrast, GOOGL\u2019s Class B shares are entitled to 10 votes per share and automatically convert to Class A shares upon sale or transfer, ensuring a more fluid transition between voting tiers. Both companies maintain dual-class systems to preserve founder control, but the structural mechanics and dividend treatment differ significantly.",

      "question": "How does Netflix's reliance on third-party infrastructure for content delivery compare to Verizon's strategic leasing of wireless towers through Vertical Bridge, particularly in terms of dependency risk and long-term operational control?",
      "answer": "Netflix depends on third-party service providers for the management, operation, and technology to support its advertising and content delivery infrastructure, which exposes it to risks if these providers fail to deliver reliable services. Meanwhile, Verizon has strategically leased over 6,000 wireless towers to Vertical Bridge REIT, LLC in exchange for a $2.8 billion upfront payment, retaining leased-back capacity for 10 years with multiple renewal options. This allows Verizon to reduce capital burden while maintaining operational use. Unlike Netflix\u2019s dependency on external providers without such structured long-term asset control, Verizon\u2019s arrangement transfers ownership risk to Vertical Bridge while preserving its own network access. Both companies rely on third-party infrastructure, but Verizon\u2019s model includes financial and operational structuring that Netflix does not apply in its content delivery ecosystem.",

The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to ex pose us to greater distribution ex penses in certain markets.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright, and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\n## Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology, business processes, and content.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and consumer products,",

Leasing Arrangements\n\nWe enter into  various  lease  arrangements  for  network  equipment  including  towers,  distributed  antenna  systems,  small  cells,  real  estate  and  connectivity mediums including dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations. Our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 1 year to 30 years, some of which include options that we can elect to extend the leases term for up to 25 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases.

      "question": "How might rising content licensing costs, which META reported as a key expense for licensed video and music, impact NFLX's gross margin given NFLX's reliance on streaming content and its reported $2.06 billion advertising spend by META that signals increased competition for exclusive content?",
      "answer": "META's 2024 10-K explicitly states that content costs for licensed video and music are expensed based on revenue or flat fees, and these costs are a significant part of their operating expenses. This indicates industry-wide pressure on content licensing fees. NFLX acknowledges in its 2024 filing that as content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to license popular content on favorable terms, leading to rising programming costs. Given that NFLX earns most of its revenue from streaming content and already faces margin pressures due to increasing content acquisition costs, rising licensing fees could further compress its gross margin. The $2.06 billion advertising expense by META signals aggressive content investment, which intensifies competition for exclusive content and indirectly pressures NFLX to spend more to maintain a compelling content mix, thereby affecting profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Content Costs\n\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform. We pay fees to these content providers based on revenue generated, a flat fee, or both. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. V ideo content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\n\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. We pay fees to music partners based on revenue generated, minimum guaranteed fees, flat fees, or a combination thereof. Ex pensed content costs are included in cost of revenue on our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Software Development Costs\n\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\n\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the preliminary project stage is complete, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Software development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\n\n## Share-based Compensation\n\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period and forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are ex pected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax  rates in the period of the enactment.\n\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\n\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax  position will be sustained on ex amination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes.\n\n## Advertising Expense\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on our consolidated statements of income. We incurred advertising expenses of $2.06 billion, $2.02 billion, and $2.65 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.",

The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to ex pose us to greater distribution ex penses in certain markets.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright, and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\n## Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology, business processes, and content.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and consumer products,",

Additionally, GOOGL's 2023 share repurchase program, which retired $62.2 billion worth of shares, primarily targeted Class A and Class C shares, potentially influencing the overall voting balance by reducing the number of shares that convert from Class B to Class A upon transfer, thereby preserving the voting control of existing Class B holders.",

      "answer": "Disney's exclusive use of Pixar-branded content in its DTC services strengthens its competitive positioning by offering unique, high-demand programming that differentiates Disney+ from competitors like CMCSA. This exclusivity, supported by Disney's ownership of Pixar (valued as an indefinite-lived intangible asset), allows Disney to leverage popular intellectual property to attract and retain subscribers. CMCSA, which competes in the same DTC and OTT streaming space, faces challenges in acquiring comparable content due to the high costs and competitive market for top-tier programming, including sports and entertainment rights. This dynamic creates an advantage for Disney in subscriber growth and content-driven brand loyalty.",

Our  home  service  group  performs  various  tasks,  including  installations,  servicing  and  upgrades  of customer premise equipment. Customers can use self-service help and support and perform self-installations for certain services.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete with a broad range of companies engaged in media, entertainment and communications services in Europe. For video services,  we  compete  with  cable  operators,  providers  of  both  paid-for  and  free-to-air  programming,  other  satellite  television providers, digital terrestrial television providers, content aggregators, home entertainment products companies, and other suppliers and providers of sports, entertainment, news and information that deliver DTC and other OTT streaming services. For broadband and wireless services, we compete with service providers making use of new fiber-optic networks, telecommunications providers, other  internet  service  providers  and  companies  developing  new  technologies  and  devices.  Our  competitive  position  may  be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of, or developments in, the means of delivery competitors use to provide their services as well as lowered prices, product innovations, new technologies or different value creation approaches. We also compete with organizations that are publicly funded, in whole or in part, to fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate.\n\nOur owned channels compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other television networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost for such content is significant.\n\nWe compete for the  sale  of  advertising  with  other  television  networks  and  stations,  digital  platforms,  and  all  other  advertising platforms. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from  us  may  be  adversely  affected  by  declines  in  television  viewership  and  the  increasing  number  of  entertainment  choices available.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, including Sky Glass and XClass TV, which launched in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sky Glass and XClass TV are smart televisions with operating systems that leverage our global technology platforms similar to Sky Q, X1 and Flex. We sell Sky Glass televisions in Europe, with the United Kingdom as the first market, to consumers that also subscribe to Sky's video services. XClass TVs are manufactured and sold by third parties and operate on our XClass TV operating system.\n\n## Seasonality and Cyclicality\n\nEach of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Cable Communications' results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year.\n\nRevenue  and  operating  costs  and  expenses  (comprised  of  total  costs  and  expenses,  excluding  depreciation  and  amortization expense) in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees.\n\nRevenue in Cable Communications, Media and Sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the United States is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season, and advertising related  to  candidates  running  for  political  office  and  issue-oriented  advertising,  respectively.  Revenue  in  Media  also  fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. Advertising revenue in Sky typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition in the summer during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup . TM\n\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms, including viewing on demand, DTC platforms or OTT service providers. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. We incur",

      "question": "How does the voting power of Class B common stockholders at META compare to that of NFLX common stockholders, given that META Class B shares are restricted to specific voting scenarios and each share carries a multiplier based on the conversion rate?",
      "answer": "META's Class B common stockholders have restricted voting rights, only applicable in specific scenarios such as exiting the core payments business, a merger, or certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation. In these cases, each Class B share's voting power is multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in effect on the record date. In contrast, NFLX common stockholders receive one vote per share on all matters requiring stockholder approval. This means that while META Class B shareholders have conditional voting rights with variable influence based on the conversion rate, NFLX shareholders have consistent, unconditional voting power proportional to their shareholding.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: META \u2192 Class B Common Stock: META discloses that Class B common stock is not publicly traded and has limited voting rights, with only 23 stockholders of record as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Voting Rights: Class B common stockholders have no voting rights except in specific scenarios, and when they do, each vote is multiplied by the conversion rate in effect on the record date.",
        "Hop 3: Voting Rights \u2190 NFLX: NFLX common stockholders are entitled to one vote per share on all matters requiring stockholder approval, with no conditional restrictions or multipliers."

      "answer": "META requires that any change-of-control transaction must be approved by a majority of its outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class until those shares represent less than 35% of combined voting power. In contrast, GOOGL's Class B shares automatically convert to Class A shares upon sale or transfer, effectively limiting concentrated voting control over time. Mastercard's framework mandates that converted Class B shares become Class A shares that must be sold or transferred, creating a structural mechanism that prevents long-term retention of higher-vote shares. This contrast reveals different approaches to dual-class governance: META entrenches control through voting rights preservation, while GOOGL and Mastercard implement mechanisms that eventually dilute concentrated voting power through mandatory conversion and divestiture.",

      "answer": "At META, Class B common stockholders hold 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, with each Class B share carrying 15 votes, while Class A shares (publicly traded) hold the remaining 66 2/3% of voting power. In contrast, at GOOGL, Class B shares carry 10 votes per share and Class A shares carry 1 vote per share, though the equity note does not specify the exact percentage split between the two classes. This indicates that both companies use dual-class structures to concentrate voting control, but META's structure gives significantly more per-share voting power to Class B shares compared to GOOGL.",

        "Hop 1: META \u2192 Class B Common Stock: META's Class B common stock has 15 votes per share and represents 33 1/3% of the combined voting power.",

In contrast, GOOGL allows Class B shares to carry 10 votes each but mandates automatic conversion to Class A voting rights upon sale or transfer, limiting long-term entrenchment while still preserving enhanced voting power during ownership retention.

      "answer": "NFLX's auditor evaluated the sensitivity of content amortization to changes in forecasted viewing hours, which directly affect the timing of amortization expense recognition. The audit included testing assumptions about historical and forecasted viewing patterns and performing sensitivity analyses to determine how changes in these assumptions would impact the amortization recorded. Similarly, DIS's auditor tested management's significant assumptions in the goodwill impairment assessment, particularly focusing on future revenue projections, operating margins, and discount rates for the entertainment linear networks and DTC services reporting units. Both companies rely on forward-looking assumptions that can materially affect financial results\u2014NFLX through content amortization timing and DIS through potential goodwill impairment charges, such as the $0.6 billion impairment recorded in fiscal 2024 for the entertainment linear networks reporting unit.",

      "question": "How does the voting power distribution tied to CMCSA's Class A and Class B common stock structure compare to GOOGL's approach, given that GOOGL also maintains a multi-tier voting rights system with Class B common stock?",
      "answer": "CMCSA's Class A common stockholders hold 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while the Class B common stockholders (beneficially owned entirely by Brian L. Roberts) hold 33 1/3% of the voting power, with each Class B share carrying 15 votes. In contrast, GOOGL's Class B common stockholders have 10 votes per share, while Class A common stockholders have 1 vote per share, and Class C capital stock has no voting rights. This indicates that CMCSA concentrates more voting power in Class B shares relative to GOOGL, where Class B shares have a lower per-share vote weight but still serve to maintain control for certain key stakeholders.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class A Common Stock: CMCSA discloses that Class A common stockholders hold 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, with Class B holding the remaining 33 1/3%.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: The Class B shares carry 15 votes per share, compared to the variable voting power of Class A shares, and are non-dilutable, with Brian L. Roberts as the sole beneficial owner.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 GOOGL: GOOGL also has a multi-tier voting structure, with Class B shares carrying 10 votes per share, Class A carrying 1 vote, and Class C having no voting rights, indicating a structurally similar but quantitatively different approach to shareholder control."

      "question": "How does the difference in voting power distribution between GOOGL's Class B common stock structure and CMCSA's Class A/Class B common stock framework influence their respective corporate governance strategies, particularly in light of GOOGL's $62.0 billion share repurchase in 2024 and CMCSA's $7,322 million cash balance?",
      "answer": "GOOGL's Class B common stock provides 10 votes per share compared to 1 vote per share for Class A, giving disproportionate voting power to certain shareholders while allowing flexibility through conversion rights. In 2024, GOOGL repurchased $62.0 billion worth of shares, which may have been influenced by its governance structure that enables concentrated decision-making. CMCSA, on the other hand, structures its voting power such that Class A holds 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, with Class B shares carrying 15 votes per share and representing 33 1/3% of voting power. Notably, Mr. Brian L. Roberts owns all of CMCSA\u2019s Class B shares, creating a dual-class system that similarly concentrates control. With CMCSA holding $7,322 million in cash as of 2024, its governance model supports long-term strategic decisions like share repurchases while maintaining control. Both companies use dual-class structures to preserve founder or key stakeholder influence, which likely enables more aggressive capital allocation strategies, such as significant share repurchases, by reducing external shareholder influence.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class B Common Stock: GOOGL\u2019s Class B shares carry 10x voting rights and are convertible to Class A shares, enabling concentrated voting control while allowing flexibility in equity structure, as seen in their $62.0 billion repurchase in 2024.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Both CMCSA and GOOGL use dual-class structures, where Class B shares have significantly more voting power than Class A shares, allowing key stakeholders to maintain control despite share repurchases or equity changes.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: CMCSA\u2019s Class A shares represent 66 2/3% of voting power, while Class B shares (held entirely by Mr. Brian L. Roberts) hold 33 1/3% with 15 votes each, and CMCSA held $7,322 million in cash as of 2024, enabling capital flexibility under a controlled governance model."

      "question": "How does the voting power distribution in GOOGL's Class B common stock compare to META's dual-class structure in terms of governance risks for Class A shareholders, given the relationship between Class A and Class B voting rights?",
      "answer": "GOOGL's Class B common stock provides 10 votes per share, compared to META's Class B common stock which provides 15 votes per share, giving disproportionate voting control to Class B shareholders in both companies. At GOOGL, Class B shares automatically convert to Class A shares upon sale or transfer, whereas at META, the dual-class structure is more entrenched, with governance provisions that require a majority of outstanding Class B shares to approve change-of-control transactions until they represent less than 35% of combined voting power. This means that governance risks for Class A shareholders are more pronounced at META due to stronger structural entrenchment mechanisms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class B Common Stock: GOOGL's Class B shares carry 10 votes per share, compared to 1 vote per share for Class A, and automatically convert to Class A shares upon sale or transfer.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: The voting power of Class A shares is diluted when Class B shares (with higher votes per share) are outstanding, as seen in both companies, though the degree of dilution differs.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 META: META's Class B shares carry 15 votes per share, and governance provisions require Class B approval for change-of-control transactions until they fall below 35% of voting power, creating stronger governance risks for Class A shareholders."

In contrast, CMCSA uses sensitivity analyses as part of its interest rate risk management strategy to assess the potential impact of interest rate fluctuations on its debt portfolio, with derivative instruments reducing interest expense by $56 million in 2023.

      "answer": "Alphabet's $62.2 billion in share repurchases in 2023, which were limited to Class A and Class C shares, likely preserved the relative voting dominance of Class B shares, which carry 10 votes per share. Since Class B shares convert to Class A on a one-for-one basis but retain no transferability to non-eligible entities, the repurchase of Class A shares may have reduced the float of voting shares without diluting the concentrated voting power of Class B holders. This contrasts with Meta\u2019s structure, where Class B shares must remain above 35% of combined voting power to maintain control, after which governance shifts occur. Alphabet\u2019s repurchase strategy thus reinforces long-term control similar to Meta\u2019s model but without the 35% threshold trigger, preserving founder influence through a different mechanism.",

      "question": "How does Alphabet's dual-class voting structure, particularly the relationship between Class A and Class B common stock, influence its share repurchase strategy compared to Comcast\u2019s equity structure, especially regarding Class B common stock disclosures?",
      "answer": "Alphabet\u2019s dual-class voting structure, where Class A shares have 1 vote and Class B shares have 10 votes per share, influences its share repurchase strategy by allowing the company to retire shares without diluting control, as Class B shares automatically convert to Class A upon sale or transfer. In 2024, Alphabet repurchased $62.0 billion worth of Class A and Class C shares, with $44.7 billion still available under the repurchase authorization. This selective repurchase approach focuses on Class A and Class C shares, which do not carry the same voting power as Class B shares, preserving governance rights. In contrast, Comcast disclosed in its 2024 10-K that it has 9,444,375 Class B common shares outstanding, which are distinct from Class A in terms of voting rights but not actively repurchased or referenced in equity management strategy, highlighting a more passive stance in managing dual-class equity dynamics.",

        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Alphabet repurchased $62.0 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2024, showing a strategic focus on these classes while preserving Class B shares that carry greater voting power.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Class B shares have 10x voting rights and convert to Class A upon sale or transfer, indicating a governance mechanism that allows control retention even amid large-scale repurchases.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: Comcast disclosed 9,444,375 Class B common shares outstanding in 2024, but unlike Alphabet, there was no indication of differential repurchase strategy or governance-driven equity management involving Class B shares."

In contrast, META's Class B common stock is not publicly traded and holds an unspecified but likely concentrated voting power, with each Class B share also carrying higher voting rights (not quantified in the evidence), though META has not disclosed a specific non-dilutable percentage or vote ratio per Class A share.",

      "answer": "CMCSA allows Class B common stock to be converted on a one-for-one basis into Class A common stock, with restrictions on ownership of Class A shares by Class B stockholders. This mechanism enables Class B holders to convert their shares but requires them to divest any resulting Class A shares. In contrast, GOOGL uses Class B common stock to consolidate voting power, as each Class B share carries 10 votes compared to one vote per Class A share. Additionally, GOOGL actively repurchased $62.0 billion worth of Class A and Class C shares in 2024, which may reduce the number of shares in circulation and influence ownership dynamics, particularly for Class A shares.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class A Common Stock: CMCSA discloses its equity structure, including issued and outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock, with Class B shares convertible into Class A shares.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: The conversion mechanism allows Class B shares to convert into Class A shares on a one-for-one basis, but Class B holders must divest any resulting Class A shares.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 GOOGL: GOOGL uses Class B common stock to maintain higher voting rights, with 10 votes per share, and actively repurchased $62.0 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2024."

In contrast, Alphabet issues Class C Capital Stock, which carries no voting rights except as required by law, but the company actively manages these shares through large-scale repurchases\u2014$62.0 billion in 2024\u2014allowing it to maintain governance control through Class A and B shares while offering different voting structures to investors.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairo s as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. Certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf are accounted for as advances and classified within other investments. Atairos may pledge our remaining unfunded capital commitment as security to lenders in connection with certain financing arrangements.  This has no effect on our funding commitments. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n\nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made cash capital contributions totaling $73 million, $145 million, and $52 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment, inclusive of advances classified within other investments, was $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.\n\n## Hulu and Collateralized Obligation\n\nIn  2019,  we  entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  with  The  Walt  Disney  Company  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries,  whereby  we  relinquished  our  board  seats  and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. Concurrent with these agreements, we also acquired additional ownership interest in Hulu previously held by AT&amp;T. Following these transactions, our interest was approximately 33% and we had the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of future equity capital calls. The agreements included put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we could require Disney to buy, and Disney could require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu. In the third quarter of 2023, we amended these agreements and agreed, among other things, that the put/call provisions regarding our interest could be exercised in November 2023 (in addition to subsequent periods) and that we would fund our share of prior equity capital calls if the put/call was ex ercised in November 2023.\n\nIn November 2023, we exercised our put right requiring Disney to purchase our interest in Hulu. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Disney paid us $8.6 billion, representing $9.2 billion for our share of Hulu's minimum equity value, less $557 million for our share of prior capital calls. Additional proceeds for any ex cess of the fair value of our interest over the $9.2 billion minimum equity value will be due following final determination of Hulu's fair value pursuant to a third-party appraisal process. In connection with the transaction, Disney also agreed to share with us 50% of the future tax benefits resulting from the purchase of our interest in Hulu. Because we continue to hold our interest in Hulu, the $9.2 billion payment from Disney is treated as an advance on the sale of our interest, which will be recognized following the finalization of the appraisal process. The receipt of the minimum proceeds resulted in a tax gain in 2023. The recorded value of our investment in Hulu of $883 million and $863 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, continues to reflect our historical cost in applying the equity method, and therefore, is less than its fair value.\n\nIn 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility, which was fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. The term loan was due at the earlier of March 2024 or upon receipt of the proceeds under the put/call provisions and was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe present the advance on the sale of our  investment  and  the  term  loan  separately  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  in  the  captions  'advance  on  sale  of investment' and 'collateralized obligation,' respectively.\n\n## Marketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify investments with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as marketable equity securities and the carrying values are primarily presented in other current assets. The changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities between measurement dates are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The fair values of our marketable equity securities are based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market prices.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

This governance structure influences share repurchase decisions, as repurchasing Class A and Class C shares does not dilute the voting power of existing Class B shareholders. In 2024, Alphabet repurchased $62.0 billion in Class A and Class C shares, and as of year-end, $44.7 billion remained available under the repurchase program. Meta also maintains a dual-class structure, with Class B shares retaining significant voting rights, as noted in its 2024 10-K filing which includes the total number of Class B shares outstanding (343,761,117).

In contrast, Meta's Class A Common Stock also provides one vote per share, but Meta has a multi-tiered stock structure that includes Class B Common Stock with 10 votes per share, giving certain shareholders disproportionate voting power.

      "answer": "Disney's 50% equity investment in A+E, which operates major cable channels like HISTORY and Lifetime, ties its financial performance to the subscriber base of MVPDs and other cable providers. As of September 2022, A+E's domestic subscriber count was a key metric for its revenue. However, A+E's content distribution through these cable providers is under pressure as consumers shift toward DTC and OTT platforms. Comcast, through its Cable Communications segment, competes directly against these same cable providers in broadband and video services, further accelerating the decline in traditional video subscribers. This dual pressure\u2014Disney\u2019s revenue tied to MVPD subscriber counts and Comcast\u2019s competitive push in the same ecosystem\u2014creates a complex exposure for Disney to ongoing subscriber erosion in a market where one of its key equity investees is structurally dependent on the very providers Comcast is displacing.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nBelow is a summary of the most significant sources of competition; for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the 'Competition' discussion within that section.\n\n- Cable Communications' and Sky's broadband services compete primarily against wireline telecommunications companies, including many that are increasing deployment of fiber-based networks, wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services (such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services), certain electric cooperatives and municipalities in the United  States  that  own  and  operate  their  own  broadband  networks  and  DBS  and  newer  satellite  broadband  providers. Broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level, including as part of COVID-19 relief efforts as well as federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021, may result in other service providers deploying new subsidized internet access networks within our footprint. Competition for Cable Communications' video services consists primarily of DTC streaming and other  OTT  service  providers,  DBS  providers  and  telecommunications  companies  with  fiber-based networks.  Sky  faces  competition  for  its  video  services  from  cable  and  telecommunications  providers  in  its  European markets.  Our  voice  and  wireless  services  primarily  compete  with  wireless  and  wireline  telecommunications  providers. Many  of  our  competitors  offer  customers  bundled  products  and  services  with  favorable  pricing,  which  has  increased competition.\n- NBCUniversal  and  Sky  face  substantial  and  increasing  competition  from  providers  of  similar  types  of  entertainment, sports,  news  and  information  content,  as  well  as  from  other  forms  of  entertainment  and  recreational  activities. NBCUniversal  and  Sky  must  compete  to  obtain  talent,  popular  content  (including  sports  programming)  and  other resources required to successfully operate their businesses. This competition has intensified as DTC streaming and other OTT service providers seek to develop high-quality programming and acquire live sports programming to attract viewers.\n\nConsolidation  of,  or  cooperation  between,  our  competitors,  including  suppliers  and  distributors  of  content,  may  increase competition in all of these areas, as may the emergence of additional competitors with significant resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing and packaging, who are competing with our businesses in all forms of content distribution and production. For example, such consolidation or cooperation may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost  streaming  services,  potentially  on  an  exclusive  basis,  through  unlimited  data-usage  plans  for  internet  or  wireless  phone services.\n\nThe  ability  of  our  businesses  to  compete  effectively  also  depends  on  our  perceived  image  and  reputation  among  our  various constituencies,  including  our  customers,  consumers,  advertisers,  business  partners,  employees,  investors  and  government authorities. In addition, our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience.\n\n## Changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.\n\nDistribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming and other OTT services, the number of Cable Communications' video customers and amount of subscriber fees paid to NBCUniversal's television networks decrease, even as Cable Communications' broadband services have become more important to consumers. DTC streaming and other OTT services have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much they pay for such content.\n\nFor  example,  Cable  Communications  continues  to  experience  net  video  customer  losses.  In  Europe,  more  of  Sky's  new  video customers  have  recently  subscribed,  and  may  continue  to  subscribe,  to  NOW,  Sky's  DTC  streaming  service,  instead  of  its traditional  DTH  video  service.  Although  we  have  attempted  to  adapt  our  video  service  offerings  and  enhance  our  broadband services for changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying the X1 and Sky Q platforms, Flex, developing new smart televisions using our global technology platform at Sky and Cable Communications, and by offering Peacock, the continuing trend of content owners delivering their content directly to consumers rather than through, or in addition to, traditional video distribution channels continues to disrupt traditional distribution business models.\n\nThe  increase  in  DTC  streaming  and  other  OTT  service  providers  also  has  significantly  increased  the  number  of  entertainment choices available to consumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers. The use of DTC streaming and other OTT services reduce traditional television viewership,  and  coupled  with  time-shifting  technologies,  such  as  DVR  and  on  demand  services,  have  caused  and  likely  will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our television programming channels. In addition, as more programming providers offer  their  content  directly  to  consumers  through  their  own  apps  or  platforms,  they  may  reduce  the  quantity  and  quality  of  the programming they license to NBCUniversal or Sky's television channels or to Peacock.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "META's Class B common stock provides holders with 10 votes per share, compared to the 1 vote per share for Class A common stock, as seen in the evidence from GOOGL_10k_2024.pdf. This creates a dual-class structure that concentrates voting power among a subset of shareholders, such as insiders or institutional holders. In contrast, CMCSA's Class A common stock, which is disclosed in CMCSA_10k_2024.pdf, has no such distinction and is the primary class of equity with 4,651,093,045 shares issued as of 2024. META's governance dynamics are thus influenced by the disproportionate voting rights tied to Class B shares, while CMCSA maintains a more uniform equity and voting structure. This distinction highlights different approaches to corporate control and shareholder influence.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: META \u2192 Class B Common Stock: META discloses its Class B common stock, which has 10 votes per share, giving certain shareholders disproportionate voting power.",

        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: CMCSA's Class A common stock is the primary equity class with no dual-class voting distinction, and 4,651,093,045 shares were issued as of 2024, indicating a more uniform shareholder structure."

      "answer": "GOOGL's 2024 share repurchase of $62.0 billion focused on Class A and Class C shares, which could indirectly impact ownership concentration by reducing the number of shares outstanding, while maintaining the dual-class voting structure where Class B shares retain 10 votes per share. In contrast, CMCSA's Class B common stock is convertible share-for-share into Class A common stock and holds 33\u2153% of the total voting power, which is non-dilutable under their articles of incorporation. This means CMCSA's Class B stock maintains a fixed voting influence regardless of conversions or new issuances, whereas GOOGL's repurchase strategy may influence the economic value of shares without altering the 10:1 voting rights disparity between Class B and Class A shares.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class B Common Stock: GOOGL's Class B shares carry 10 votes per share and can be converted to Class A shares, with $62.0 billion in 2024 share repurchases targeting Class A and Class C shares.",

      "answer": "CMCSA competes with Disney in media and entertainment by offering DTC and OTT services, including owned channels that vie for advertising revenue and content acquisition. Disney's DTC service, Disney+, includes Marvel-branded programming, which is a key component of its content strategy. DIS holds an ownership stake in Marvel, which contributes to its competitive position by providing exclusive content that enhances Disney+'s appeal to subscribers. This creates a three-hop chain where CMCSA competes with Disney\u2019s media offerings, which are bolstered by Marvel content, and DIS\u2019s financial stake in Marvel further supports Disney+'s competitive edge.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ntelevision  and  the  internet.  Our  home  service  group  performs  various  tasks,  including  installations,  servicing  and  upgrades  of customer premise equipment. Customers can use self-service help and support and perform self-installations for certain services.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete with a broad range of companies engaged in media, entertainment and communications services in Europe. For video services,  we  compete  with  cable  operators,  providers  of  both  paid-for  and  free-to-air  programming,  other  satellite  television providers, digital terrestrial television providers, content aggregators, home entertainment products companies, and other suppliers and providers of sports, entertainment, news and information that deliver DTC and other OTT streaming services. For broadband and wireless services, we compete with service providers making use of new fiber-optic networks, telecommunications providers, other  internet  service  providers  and  companies  developing  new  technologies  and  devices.  Our  competitive  position  may  be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of, or developments in, the means of delivery competitors use to provide their services as well as lowered prices, product innovations, new technologies or different value creation approaches. We also compete with organizations that are publicly funded, in whole or in part, to fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate.\n\nOur owned channels compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other television networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost for such content is significant.\n\nWe compete for the  sale  of  advertising  with  other  television  networks  and  stations,  digital  platforms,  and  all  other  advertising platforms. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from  us  may  be  adversely  affected  by  declines  in  television  viewership  and  the  increasing  number  of  entertainment  choices available.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, including Sky Glass and XClass TV, which launched in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sky Glass and XClass TV are smart televisions with operating systems that leverage our global technology platforms similar to Sky Q, X1 and Flex. We sell Sky Glass televisions in Europe, with the United Kingdom as the first market, to consumers that also subscribe to Sky's video services. XClass TVs are manufactured and sold by third parties and operate on our XClass TV operating system.\n\n## Seasonality and Cyclicality\n\nEach of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Cable Communications' results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year.\n\nRevenue  and  operating  costs  and  expenses  (comprised  of  total  costs  and  expenses,  excluding  depreciation  and  amortization expense) in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees.\n\nRevenue in Cable Communications, Media and Sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the United States is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season, and advertising related  to  candidates  running  for  political  office  and  issue-oriented  advertising,  respectively.  Revenue  in  Media  also  fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. Advertising revenue in Sky typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition in the summer during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup . TM\n\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms, including viewing on demand, DTC platforms or OTT service providers. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. We incur",

      "answer": "Alphabet's 2023 share repurchase of $62.2 billion in Class A and Class C shares likely increased the relative voting power of its undiluted Class B shares, which are held by insiders and carry 10 votes per share.

Controls and Procedures\n\n## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Ex change Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the  Securities  and  Ex change  Commission,  and  that  such  information  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  management,  including  our  CEO  and  CFO,  as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. G AAP. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst &amp; Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Limitations on E ffectiv eness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n\n## Item 9B. Other Information\n\n## Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\n\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the officers and directors listed below adopted, modified, or terminated trading plans intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nOn November 27, 2024, Peggy Alford,  a member of our board of directors, entered into a trading plan that provides for the sale of an aggregate of up to $1.2 million worth of shares of our Class A common stock. The plan will terminate on November 15, 2025, subject to early termination for certain specified events set forth in the plan.\n\nOn November 27, 2024, Christopher K. Cox, our Chief Product Officer, entered into a trading plan that provides for the sale of an aggregate of up to 60,000 shares of our Class A common stock. The plan will terminate on February 20, 2026, subject to early termination for certain specified events set forth in the plan.",

      "question": "How does the voting structure of Netflix's common stock compare to Comcast's Class A Common Stock, particularly in terms of shareholder influence, given that both companies disclose specific voting rights associated with their equity structures?",
      "answer": "Netflix's common stock provides each share with one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders, ensuring equal voting influence among shareholders. In contrast, Comcast's Class A Common Stock also grants one vote per share, but the company has a dual-class structure that includes Class B Common Stock, which holds a number of votes reflecting the economic interests of a major shareholder (A/N) in Charter Holdings. This means that while both companies grant one vote per share for their respective Class A stock, Comcast\u2019s structure allows for disproportionate voting power through its Class B shares, unlike Netflix\u2019s single-class system.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NFLX \u2192 Voting Rights: NFLX discloses that each share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters voted upon by stockholders.",

        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: CMCSA discloses that it issues Class A Common Stock with one vote per share, aligning with the structure described in CHTR\u2019s financial statements."

This creates a concentrated voting structure where Class B shares can exert significant influence during specific corporate events. Similarly, GOOGL's Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, giving disproportionate voting power to holders of this class, although the rights of Class A and Class B are otherwise identical. Both companies use dual-class structures to maintain control with certain stakeholders, but META's Class B shares only gain enhanced voting rights under defined conditions, whereas GOOGL's Class B shares have consistently higher voting power.

      "question": "How might the EU AI Act, as a key example of evolving AI regulations, differently impact META's open-source AI initiatives compared to GOOGL's content moderation and search ranking systems, given the specific compliance risks outlined in their respective filings?",
      "answer": "The EU AI Act could pose distinct compliance challenges for META and GOOGL due to their different AI implementations. META, which develops AI technology made available via open source, faces risks that third parties may misuse their models for harmful purposes such as misinformation or data privacy violations, which could harm their business or reputation (META_10k_2024.pdf). GOOGL, on the other hand, relies heavily on AI for search ranking and content moderation, and faces specific threats from bad actors using AI to generate web spam or manipulate search rankings, which could degrade service quality and increase regulatory scrutiny (GOOGL_10k_2024.pdf). Both companies must navigate the uncertainty of how evolving regulations like the EU AI Act will apply to their AI systems, but the nature of their compliance costs and operational adjustments will differ based on their AI use cases\u2014META focusing on limiting downstream misuse of its models, and GOOGL enhancing detection of AI-generated spam and improving transparency in AI-driven search results (GS_10k_2024.pdf).",

For ex ample, our AI-related efforts, particularly those related to generative AI, subject us to risks related to harmful or illegal content, accuracy, misinformation and deepfakes (including related to elections), bias, discrimination, tox icity, consumer protection, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and sanctions and export controls, among others. It is also uncertain how various laws related to online services, intermediary liability, and other issues will apply to content generated by AI. In addition, we are subject to the risks of new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, or other legal liability, ethical concerns, negative consumer perceptions as to automation and AI, activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nAs a result of the complexity and rapid development of AI, it is also the subject of evolving review by various governmental and regulatory agencies in jurisdictions around the world, which are applying, or are considering applying, platform moderation, intellectual property, cybersecurity, export controls, and data protection laws to AI and/or are considering general legal frameworks on AI (such as the recently passed EU AI Act). We may not always be able to anticipate how courts and regulators will apply existing laws to AI, predict how new legal frameworks will develop to address AI, or otherwise respond to these frameworks as they are still  rapidly evolving.  We may also have to expend resources to adapt to new legal frameworks, and adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks on AI are not consistent across jurisdictions.\n\nFurther, we face significant competition from other companies that are developing their own AI features and technologies. Other companies may develop AI features and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or are more cost-effective to develop and deploy. G iven the long history of development in the AI sector, other parties may have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our own AI features. Our AI initiatives also depend on our access to data to effectively train our models. Further, our ability to continue to develop and effectively deploy AI technologies is dependent on access to specific third-party equipment and other technical and physical infrastructure, such as processing hardware, network capacity, computing power, and related energy requirements, as to which we cannot control the availability or pricing, especially in a highly competitive environment.\n\nWe are also developing AI technology that we make available via open source, commercial, and non-commercial license agreements to third-parties that can use this technology for use in their own products and services. We may not have insight into, or control over, the practices of third parties who may utilize such AI technologies. As such, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not use such AI technologies for improper purposes, including through the dissemination of illegal,  inaccurate,  defamatory  or  harmful  content,  intellectual  property  infringement  or  misappropriation,  furthering  bias  or  discrimination,  cybersecurity  attacks including  spear  phishing  attacks,  data  privacy  violations,  other  activities  that  threaten  people's  safety  or  well-being  on-  or  offline,  or  to  develop  competing technologies.  While  we  may  mitigate  certain  risks  associated  with  the  improper  use  of  our AI  models  through  both  technical  measures  and  the  inclusion  of contractual restrictions on third-party use in any agreement between us and any third party, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be effective. Such improper use by any third party could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results or subject us to legal liability.\n\nIt is not possible to predict all of the risks related to the use of AI and changes in laws, rules, directives, and regulations or other regulatory developments regarding the use of AI, including restrictions around the collection and use of data, may adversely affect our ability to develop and use AI or subject us to legal liability.\n\n## We make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\n\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, our \"Y our Activity off-Meta Technologies\" tool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective ads to our users.

The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

While we inv est significantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relev ant results and to detect and prev ent low-quality content and inv alid  traffic,  we  hav e  been  unable  and  may  continue to be unable to detect and prev ent all such abuses or promote uniformly high-quality content. Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new av enues of abuse for bad actors.\n\nMany websites violate or attempt to v iolate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engine's assessment of their relev ance and utility would rank them. Such efforts hav e affected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms  and  lead  them  to  display  false,  misleading,  or  undesirable  content. Although  English-language  web  spam  in  our  search  results  has  been reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improv e their rankings. Although we continue to inv est in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prev ent web spam on our platforms, there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful, and our users may hav e negativ e experiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended, which may affect  our  users'  decisions  in  continuing  to  use  our  platforms.  We  also  face  other  challenges  from  low-quality  and  irrelev ant  content  websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improv e their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prev ent abuse from low-quality websites, but we may not always be successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including v iolations of our content guidelines inv olv ing incidents such as attempted election interference; activ ities that threaten the safety and/or well-being of our users, including minors, on- or off-line; and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation.\n\nIf we fail to either detect and prev ent an increase in problematic content or effectiv ely promote high-quality content, it could hurt our reputation for deliv ering relev ant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in monetary penalties and damages and div ert management's time and attention.\n\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\n\nOur products and serv ices depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant network capacity to  work  effectiv ely.  Currently,  this  access  is  prov ided  by  companies  that  hav e  significant  market  power  in  the  broadband  and  internet  access marketplace,  including  incumbent  telephone  companies,  cable  companies,  mobile  communications  companies,  and  gov ernment-owned  serv ice prov iders. Some of these prov iders hav e taken, or hav e stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, by charging increased fees  to  us  or  our  users  to  prov ide  our  offerings,  or  by  prov iding  our  competitors  preferential  access.  Some  jurisdictions  hav e  adopted  regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access prov iders; howev er, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and serv ices hav e been subject to gov ernment-initiated restrictions or blockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, adv ertisers, and/or content prov iders, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby negativ ely affecting our business.\n\n## Risks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\n\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to expand our business.\n\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state as well as foreign laws and regulations cov ering a wide v ariety of subjects, and our introduction of  new  businesses,  products,  serv ices,  and  technologies  will  likely  continue  to  subject  us  to  additional  laws  and  regulations.  In  recent  years, governments around the world hav e proposed and adopted a large number of new laws and regulations relev ant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data priv acy and security, competition, AI, and online content.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nBelow is a summary of the most significant sources of competition; for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the 'Competition' discussion within that section.\n\n- Cable Communications' and Sky's broadband services compete primarily against wireline telecommunications companies, including many that are increasing deployment of fiber-based networks, wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services (such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services), certain electric cooperatives and municipalities in the United  States  that  own  and  operate  their  own  broadband  networks  and  DBS  and  newer  satellite  broadband  providers. Broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level, including as part of COVID-19 relief efforts as well as federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021, may result in other service providers deploying new subsidized internet access networks within our footprint. Competition for Cable Communications' video services consists primarily of DTC streaming and other  OTT  service  providers,  DBS  providers  and  telecommunications  companies  with  fiber-based networks.  Sky  faces  competition  for  its  video  services  from  cable  and  telecommunications  providers  in  its  European markets.  Our  voice  and  wireless  services  primarily  compete  with  wireless  and  wireline  telecommunications  providers. Many  of  our  competitors  offer  customers  bundled  products  and  services  with  favorable  pricing,  which  has  increased competition.\n- NBCUniversal  and  Sky  face  substantial  and  increasing  competition  from  providers  of  similar  types  of  entertainment, sports,  news  and  information  content,  as  well  as  from  other  forms  of  entertainment  and  recreational  activities. NBCUniversal  and  Sky  must  compete  to  obtain  talent,  popular  content  (including  sports  programming)  and  other resources required to successfully operate their businesses. This competition has intensified as DTC streaming and other OTT service providers seek to develop high-quality programming and acquire live sports programming to attract viewers.\n\nConsolidation  of,  or  cooperation  between,  our  competitors,  including  suppliers  and  distributors  of  content,  may  increase competition in all of these areas, as may the emergence of additional competitors with significant resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing and packaging, who are competing with our businesses in all forms of content distribution and production. For example, such consolidation or cooperation may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost  streaming  services,  potentially  on  an  exclusive  basis,  through  unlimited  data-usage  plans  for  internet  or  wireless  phone services.\n\nThe  ability  of  our  businesses  to  compete  effectively  also  depends  on  our  perceived  image  and  reputation  among  our  various constituencies,  including  our  customers,  consumers,  advertisers,  business  partners,  employees,  investors  and  government authorities. In addition, our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience.\n\n## Changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.\n\nDistribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming and other OTT services, the number of Cable Communications' video customers and amount of subscriber fees paid to NBCUniversal's television networks decrease, even as Cable Communications' broadband services have become more important to consumers. DTC streaming and other OTT services have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much they pay for such content.\n\nFor  example,  Cable  Communications  continues  to  experience  net  video  customer  losses.  In  Europe,  more  of  Sky's  new  video customers  have  recently  subscribed,  and  may  continue  to  subscribe,  to  NOW,  Sky's  DTC  streaming  service,  instead  of  its traditional  DTH  video  service.  Although  we  have  attempted  to  adapt  our  video  service  offerings  and  enhance  our  broadband services for changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying the X1 and Sky Q platforms, Flex, developing new smart televisions using our global technology platform at Sky and Cable Communications, and by offering Peacock, the continuing trend of content owners delivering their content directly to consumers rather than through, or in addition to, traditional video distribution channels continues to disrupt traditional distribution business models.\n\nThe  increase  in  DTC  streaming  and  other  OTT  service  providers  also  has  significantly  increased  the  number  of  entertainment choices available to consumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers. The use of DTC streaming and other OTT services reduce traditional television viewership,  and  coupled  with  time-shifting  technologies,  such  as  DVR  and  on  demand  services,  have  caused  and  likely  will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our television programming channels. In addition, as more programming providers offer  their  content  directly  to  consumers  through  their  own  apps  or  platforms,  they  may  reduce  the  quantity  and  quality  of  the programming they license to NBCUniversal or Sky's television channels or to Peacock.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does NFLX's investment in original programming to differentiate its service compare to DIS's strategy with ESPN+ in terms of subscriber growth and bundling with Disney+ and Hulu, given the risks and costs associated with original content production outlined in both filings?",
      "answer": "NFLX emphasizes original programming as a key differentiator in a highly competitive streaming market, acknowledging the significant financial risks involved, including high production costs, guild payments, and potential liability for content-related claims. The company devotes substantial resources to original content to attract and retain members, but this strategy exposes it to volatility in production timelines and costs, as well as market reception uncertainty. In contrast, DIS leverages ESPN+ as part of a broader bundled DTC strategy, offering it with Disney+ and Hulu to drive subscriber acquisition and retention. As of September 2024, ESPN+ had approximately 26 million paid subscribers in the U.S., with original programming playing a supporting role in its content offering alongside live sports and on-demand events. DIS's bundling approach allows it to capitalize on synergies across its DTC platforms, potentially reducing customer acquisition costs and enhancing value perception, while NFLX must shoulder the full burden of content investment independently. Both companies face similar risks around original content costs and market acceptance, but DIS\u2019s diversified bundling model may offer more financial stability in scaling its service.",

They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. In addition, new technological developments, including the development and use of generative artificial intelligence, are rapidly evolving. If our competitors gain an advantage by using such technologies more effectively to satisfy consumer demand, our ability to compete successfully and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Piracy also threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. In light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth, and our efforts to prevent that growth may be insufficient. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors and win moments of truth, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\n## We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We devote significant resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming. We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As a content producer, we are responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments, and take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Further, negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements have, and in the future, could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming. We may face potential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, is prohibited by law, or could be damaging to our brand or business.\n\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\n## If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our services, such as introducing games and advertising on our service, as well as offering live programming and expanding our consumer products and experiences. We are also scaling our own studio operations to produce original content. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service and introduce new features such as our ad-supported subscription plan and live programming, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party 'cloud' computing, technology and other services. As we scale our content production, including games, and introduce new features and expand our consumer products and experience offerings, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources, which requires significant resources and management attention. Further, we may expand our content and service offerings in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or evolving our corporate culture, as well as our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.\n\n## If we fail to maintain a positiv e reputation concerning our serv ice and the content w e offer, w e may not be able to attract or retain members, w e may face regulatory scrutiny and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members.

      "question": "How does Alphabet's repurchase of Class C shares, which carry no voting rights, enable different capital allocation flexibility compared to Netflix's share repurchase strategy under its uniform voting rights structure?",
      "answer": "Alphabet's repurchase of Class C shares, which carry no voting rights, allows the company to return capital to shareholders while preserving insider control through the retention of higher-vote Class A and B shares. In 2023, Alphabet repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares, with an additional $36.3 billion remaining available under the repurchase authorization. In contrast, Netflix's capital stock carries uniform voting rights \u2014 one vote per share \u2014 meaning any significant share repurchase could potentially dilute voting control among existing shareholders. This structural difference implies that Netflix may need to be more cautious in its repurchase activity to avoid unintended shifts in governance, unlike Alphabet which can execute larger buybacks without affecting its core governance structure.",

        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class C Capital Stock: Alphabet repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023, with $36.3 billion remaining available under the repurchase program, indicating a significant capital allocation tool.",

In contrast, Charter Communications (CHTR) maintains a dual-class stock structure where Class A common stock entitles holders to one vote per share, while Class B common stock, held by A/N, has voting rights that reflect A/N's economic interests in Charter Holdings, enabling concentrated control. Similarly, Alphabet (GOOGL) uses a dual-class structure where Class A common stock has one vote per share, and Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, allowing certain shareholders to maintain significant voting power. These dual-class structures at CHTR and GOOGL are designed to preserve control by key stakeholders, whereas CMCSA's absence of voting rights in Atairos directly limits its influence over the entity\u2019s operations and strategic decisions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairo s as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. Certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf are accounted for as advances and classified within other investments. Atairos may pledge our remaining unfunded capital commitment as security to lenders in connection with certain financing arrangements.  This has no effect on our funding commitments. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n\nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made cash capital contributions totaling $73 million, $145 million, and $52 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment, inclusive of advances classified within other investments, was $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.\n\n## Hulu and Collateralized Obligation\n\nIn  2019,  we  entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  with  The  Walt  Disney  Company  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries,  whereby  we  relinquished  our  board  seats  and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. Concurrent with these agreements, we also acquired additional ownership interest in Hulu previously held by AT&amp;T. Following these transactions, our interest was approximately 33% and we had the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of future equity capital calls. The agreements included put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we could require Disney to buy, and Disney could require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu. In the third quarter of 2023, we amended these agreements and agreed, among other things, that the put/call provisions regarding our interest could be exercised in November 2023 (in addition to subsequent periods) and that we would fund our share of prior equity capital calls if the put/call was ex ercised in November 2023.\n\nIn November 2023, we exercised our put right requiring Disney to purchase our interest in Hulu. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Disney paid us $8.6 billion, representing $9.2 billion for our share of Hulu's minimum equity value, less $557 million for our share of prior capital calls. Additional proceeds for any ex cess of the fair value of our interest over the $9.2 billion minimum equity value will be due following final determination of Hulu's fair value pursuant to a third-party appraisal process. In connection with the transaction, Disney also agreed to share with us 50% of the future tax benefits resulting from the purchase of our interest in Hulu. Because we continue to hold our interest in Hulu, the $9.2 billion payment from Disney is treated as an advance on the sale of our interest, which will be recognized following the finalization of the appraisal process. The receipt of the minimum proceeds resulted in a tax gain in 2023. The recorded value of our investment in Hulu of $883 million and $863 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, continues to reflect our historical cost in applying the equity method, and therefore, is less than its fair value.\n\nIn 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility, which was fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. The term loan was due at the earlier of March 2024 or upon receipt of the proceeds under the put/call provisions and was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe present the advance on the sale of our  investment  and  the  term  loan  separately  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  in  the  captions  'advance  on  sale  of investment' and 'collateralized obligation,' respectively.\n\n## Marketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify investments with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as marketable equity securities and the carrying values are primarily presented in other current assets. The changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities between measurement dates are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The fair values of our marketable equity securities are based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market prices.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Our  home  service  group  performs  various  tasks,  including  installations,  servicing  and  upgrades  of customer premise equipment. Customers can use self-service help and support and perform self-installations for certain services.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete with a broad range of companies engaged in media, entertainment and communications services in Europe. For video services,  we  compete  with  cable  operators,  providers  of  both  paid-for  and  free-to-air  programming,  other  satellite  television providers, digital terrestrial television providers, content aggregators, home entertainment products companies, and other suppliers and providers of sports, entertainment, news and information that deliver DTC and other OTT streaming services. For broadband and wireless services, we compete with service providers making use of new fiber-optic networks, telecommunications providers, other  internet  service  providers  and  companies  developing  new  technologies  and  devices.  Our  competitive  position  may  be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of, or developments in, the means of delivery competitors use to provide their services as well as lowered prices, product innovations, new technologies or different value creation approaches. We also compete with organizations that are publicly funded, in whole or in part, to fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate.\n\nOur owned channels compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other television networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost for such content is significant.\n\nWe compete for the  sale  of  advertising  with  other  television  networks  and  stations,  digital  platforms,  and  all  other  advertising platforms. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from  us  may  be  adversely  affected  by  declines  in  television  viewership  and  the  increasing  number  of  entertainment  choices available.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, including Sky Glass and XClass TV, which launched in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sky Glass and XClass TV are smart televisions with operating systems that leverage our global technology platforms similar to Sky Q, X1 and Flex. We sell Sky Glass televisions in Europe, with the United Kingdom as the first market, to consumers that also subscribe to Sky's video services. XClass TVs are manufactured and sold by third parties and operate on our XClass TV operating system.\n\n## Seasonality and Cyclicality\n\nEach of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Cable Communications' results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year.\n\nRevenue  and  operating  costs  and  expenses  (comprised  of  total  costs  and  expenses,  excluding  depreciation  and  amortization expense) in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees.\n\nRevenue in Cable Communications, Media and Sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the United States is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season, and advertising related  to  candidates  running  for  political  office  and  issue-oriented  advertising,  respectively.  Revenue  in  Media  also  fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. Advertising revenue in Sky typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition in the summer during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup . TM\n\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms, including viewing on demand, DTC platforms or OTT service providers. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. We incur",

      "answer": "At CMCSA, Class B common stock (9,444,375 shares) holds 33\u2153% of the combined voting power with 15 votes per share, concentrated under Mr. Brian L. Roberts, while Class A common stock (4,651,093,045 issued) holds 66\u2154% of voting power. In contrast, META has 2,189,898,148 shares of Class A common stock and 343,761,117 shares of Class B common stock outstanding as of January 2025, indicating a more dispersed but still dual-class structure.

      "answer": "In CMCSA, holders of Class A common stock collectively hold 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stock (held entirely by Brian L. Roberts) holds 33 1/3%, with each Class B share carrying 15 votes. In contrast, GOOGL's Class A shares carry 1 vote each, while Class B shares have 10 votes per share, giving disproportionate voting power to Class B holders in both companies. Additionally, GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023, which could affect ownership concentration and voting dynamics, though CMCSA does not disclose such repurchase volumes for Class A shares directly.",

      "question": "How does the voting power distribution tied to CMCSA's Class B common stock, which is entirely owned by Brian L. Roberts, influence the governance structure compared to GOOGL's dual-class stock system where Class A and Class B shares have differential voting rights?",
      "answer": "CMCSA's Class B common stock, entirely owned by Brian L. Roberts, holds 33\u2153% of the combined voting power with each share carrying 15 votes, creating a non-dilutable control mechanism. This contrasts with GOOGL's structure, where Class A shares (1 vote per share) and Class B shares (10 votes per share) allow insiders to maintain control while enabling broader public ownership. Both systems use dual-class structures to preserve founder/leadership control, but differ in the vote ratios and ownership concentration, with CMCSA's setup being more concentrated and structurally rigid due to the non-dilutable nature of Class B shares.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class B Common Stock: CMCSA discloses that all Class B shares (9,444,375 issued and outstanding) are owned by Brian L. Roberts and carry 15 votes per share, representing 33\u2153% of total voting power.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: The Class A common stock holds 66\u2154% of the voting power, with each share's voting weight dynamically adjusted based on the number of Class A and Class B shares outstanding, ensuring the 66\u2154% / 33\u2153% split remains intact.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 GOOGL: GOOGL also maintains a dual-class structure with Class A shares (1 vote each) and Class B shares (10 votes each), allowing insiders to retain control while offering public investors Class A shares with limited voting rights."

      "answer": "Disney's 2024 VAR model excludes firm commitments and foreign-denominated accounts receivable/payable from its risk assessment, relying instead on the variance/co-variance technique to estimate potential losses in financial instruments, which resulted in a $255 million VAR at September 28, 2024. In contrast, Netflix actively hedges its firm commitments related to foreign currency-denominated content licensing and production through forward contracts, aiming to reduce operating income and cash flow volatility from exchange rate fluctuations. This indicates that while Disney does not directly model firm commitments in its VAR, Netflix integrates them into its risk management framework through derivative instruments.",

      "answer": "CMCSA issued 9,444,375 shares of Class B Common Stock in 2024, which, as per the governance structure outlined in V_10k_2024.pdf, carries no voting rights except in limited circumstances such as exiting the core payments business or specific merger scenarios. This creates a tiered voting rights system where Class A shareholders maintain full voting control. Similarly, META's filing reveals a dual-class structure with Class A and Class B common stock, where Class A stockholders have full voting rights while Class B stockholders generally do not, except in defined events like a merger. Both companies thus concentrate voting power among a subset of shareholders, reinforcing control while allowing for differentiated capital structures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class B Common Stock: CMCSA disclosed issuing 9,444,375 shares of Class B Common Stock in 2024, which lacks standard voting rights.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: According to V_10k_2024.pdf, Class B shares only gain voting rights in specific corporate events, while Class A shares retain full voting control.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 META: META's 10-K confirms a dual-class structure where Class A shares have full voting rights and Class B shares do not, except in limited cases such as merger approvals."

      "question": "How does the structure of CMCSA's Class A Common Stock with respect to voting rights compare to NFLX's stockholder governance framework, and what does Alphabet's dual-class stock structure suggest about industry practices for balancing control and shareholder influence?",
      "answer": "CMCSA's Class A Common Stock carries one vote per share, while the company also issues Class B Common Stock with 10 votes per share, creating a differentiated voting rights structure. In contrast, NFLX provides one vote per share for all common stockholders, indicating a more egalitarian governance model. Alphabet (GOOGL), like CMCSA, maintains a dual-class structure where Class A shares have one vote and Class B shares have 10 votes per share, reinforcing concentrated control while allowing broader equity participation. This suggests that media and tech firms often adopt multi-class stock structures to preserve strategic control while offering varied shareholder investment opportunities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class A Common Stock: CMCSA discloses its Class A Common Stock with 1 vote per share and distinguishes it from Class B shares with higher voting rights.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Voting Rights: Alphabet's filings clarify that multi-class stock structures differentiate voting rights, with Class A shares having limited control relative to Class B shares.",
        "Hop 3: Voting Rights \u2190 NFLX: NFLX explicitly states that each share of common stock provides one vote, contrasting with CMCSA and GOOGL's dual-class systems."

      "answer": "META initiated its first-ever dividend program in 2024, paying $0.50 per share on both Class A and Class B common stock, indicating equal treatment of both classes for dividend purposes. Meanwhile, GOOGL's share repurchase activity in 2023 focused exclusively on Class A and Class C shares, with $62.2 billion repurchased during the year, leaving $36.3 billion available under the new $70.0 billion authorization. Since GOOGL's Class B shares automatically convert to Class A upon sale or transfer, the repurchase of Class A shares could indirectly affect Class B holders through conversion dynamics, even though Class B shares themselves were not directly targeted in repurchase programs.",

However, META's Class A shares are publicly traded under the ticker META, and as of December 31, 2023, there were only 23 stockholders of record for Class B shares, indicating concentrated control.

      "answer": "META's Class B common stock has 343,761,117 shares outstanding and retains 33\u2153% of total voting power, which is protected from dilution by additional issuances of any other class of stock. This is similar to Comcast's structure where Class B shares also maintain a non-dilutable 33\u2153% voting power and are convertible share-for-share into Class A stock. In contrast, GOOGL has been actively repurchasing both Class A and Class C shares, spending $62.0 billion in 2024 alone, which impacts the overall equity base but does not dilute voting power since Class C shares have no voting rights and Class A shares only have one vote per share. The key distinction lies in how META and GOOGL manage ownership control: META protects Class B voting concentration, while GOOGL uses share repurchases to offset dilution without altering the relative voting balance.",

        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: The evidence from Comcast shows that Class B shares are convertible share-for-share into Class A shares, a mechanism also referenced in GOOGL\u2019s disclosures where Class B shares convert to Class A upon sale or transfer.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 GOOGL: GOOGL repurchased $62.0 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2024, with Class C having no voting rights, indicating that repurchases are used to manage equity value rather than voting control."

      "answer": "Comcast disclosed its Class A Common Stock is registered on Nasdaq with one vote per share, while Alphabet's Class B Common Stock, which also exists alongside Class A, grants 10 votes per share and can convert to Class A upon sale or transfer. In 2023, Alphabet repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares, indicating a preference for repurchasing non-voting or lower-vote classes, potentially to maintain control through Class B shares.",

      "answer": "The dismissal with prejudice of Slack's securities litigation in February 2025 provides a resolution that may enhance customer and investor confidence in enterprise communication platforms, particularly as Slack had faced prolonged legal uncertainty since 2019. Given that Google competes in this market with its Workspace offerings, including Gemini for Google Workspace, this resolution could indirectly benefit Google by reducing the legal and reputational risk associated with using or investing in competing platforms. In contrast, Meta continues to face active securities litigation as of November 2024, including appeals in cases related to its platform and user data practices, as well as ongoing scrutiny from the European Commission. These unresolved legal issues may create ongoing uncertainty for Meta\u2019s business and could influence enterprise customers to favor platforms with clearer legal standing, such as Google Workspace, which does not appear to face similar litigation exposure.",

Alphabet's inv estment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at v arious stages of dev elopment, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriv ing, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside inv estors. While these earlystage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating rev enue and making important strides in their industries. Rev enues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related serv ices, and internet serv ices.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptiv e technologies.

For example, for adv ertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and serv ices are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relev ance of our adv ertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and av ailability of our products and serv ices;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliv er their adv ertisements in an efficient and effectiv e manner across a v ariety of distribution channels; and\n- content prov iders, primarily based on the quality of our adv ertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate rev enues from adv ertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.",

Legal Proceedings and Claims\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is or may be involved in various legal or regulatory proceedings, claims or purported class actions related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour and other claims. The Company has been, and may in the future be, put on notice or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement.\n\nIn general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Company's financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Company's reputation and future operating results.\n\nThe Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. The outcomes of legal proceedings and other contingencies are, however, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. At this time, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible losses in excess of any amounts accrued, including losses that could arise as a result of application of non-monetary remedies, with respect to the contingencies it faces, and the Company's estimates may not prove to be accurate.\n\nIn management's opinion, resolution of all current matters, including those described below, is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial statements. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, payment or other contingency, the resolution of a matter could materially affect the Company's current or future results of operations or cash flows, or both, in a particular quarter.\n\n## Slack Litigation\n\nBeginning in September 2019, seven purported class action lawsuits were filed against Slack, its directors, certain of its officers and certain investment funds associated with certain of its directors, each alleging violations of securities laws in connection with Slack's registration statement on Form S-1 (the 'Registration Statement') filed with the SEC. All but one of these actions were filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Mateo, though one plaintiff originally filed in the County of San Francisco before refiling in the County of San Mateo (and the original San Francisco action was dismissed). The remaining action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the 'Federal Action'). In the Federal Action, captioned Dennee v. Slack Technologies, Inc., Case No. 3:19-CV-05857-SI, Slack and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in January 2020. In April 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. In May 2020, Slack and the other defendants filed a motion to certify the court's order for interlocutory appeal, which the court granted. Slack and the other defendants filed a petition for permission to appeal the district court's order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which was granted in July 2020. Oral argument was heard in May 2021. On September 20, 2021, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling. Slack filed a petition for rehearing with the Ninth Circuit on November 3, 2021, which was denied on May 2, 2022. Slack filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on August 31, 2022, which was granted on December 13, 2022. On June 1, 2023, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision vacating the Ninth Circuit's decision and remanded for further proceedings. The Ninth Circuit ordered the parties to submit additional briefing in light of the Supreme Court's decision. On February 10, 2025, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court's order and instructing the district court to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. The state court actions were consolidated in November 2019, and the consolidated action is captioned In re Slack Technologies, Inc. Shareholder Litigation, Lead Case No. 19CIV05370 (the 'State Court Action'). An additional state court action was filed in San Mateo County in June 2020 but was consolidated with the State Court Action in July 2020. Slack and the other defendants filed demurrers to the complaint in the State Court Action in February 2020. In August 2020, the court sustained in part and overruled in part the demurrers, and granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint, which they filed in October 2020. Slack and the other defendants answered the complaint in November 2020. Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on October 21, 2021, which remains pending. On October 26, 2022, the court stayed the State Court Action pending resolution of Slack's petition for a writ of certiorari in the Federal Action. The State Court Action remains stayed pending resolution of the appellate proceedings in the Federal Action. The Federal Action and the State Court Action seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief on",

On December 30, 2024, we filed our motion for summary judgment in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers.\n\nIn December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules. On November 18, 2024, the European Commission issued a decision that Meta infringed Article 102 on the Treaty  of  the  Functioning  of  the  European  Union  in  relation  to  certain  alleged  business  practices  relating  to  Facebook  Marketplace  and  imposed  a  fine  of approximately EUR \u20ac798 million. We appealed the European Commission's decision on January 28, 2025.\n\nIn March 2024, the European Commission opened an investigation into the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" consent model with requirements under Article 5(2) of the Digital Markets Act. The European Commission issued preliminary findings on July 1, 2024 reflecting its preliminary view that our model does not comply with such requirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation by March 2025.\n\nThe result of such litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\n\n## Securities and Other Actions\n\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In Re Facebook, Inc. Securities Litigation ) with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its decision affirming in part and reversing in part the district court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' case. We filed a petition for writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024 with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the Ninth Circuit's order. The Supreme Court granted in part our petition for writ of certiorari on June 10, 2024, and following oral argument issued an order on November 22, 2024 dismissing the grant of certiorari as improvidently granted.\n\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning in September  2021,  we  became  subject  to  government  investigations  and  requests  relating  to  a  former  employee's  allegations  and  release  of  internal  company documents concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received additional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with the same matters, and seeking unspecified damages ( Ohio Pub. Empl. Ret.  Sys. v.  Meta  Platforms,  Inc .).  On  September  30,  2024,  the  court  dismissed  certain  claims  with  leave  to  amend,  but determined certain claims regarding content enforcement practices and user well-being could proceed against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers.\n\nOn March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking unspecified damages ( Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Trust v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ). On July 18, 2023, the court dismissed the claims against Meta and its officers with leave to amend. On September 18, 2023, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and on September 17, 2024, the court dismissed the claims with prejudice. On October 14, 2024, plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal.",

      "question": "How does the voting power distribution between Class A and Class B common stock at Comcast compare to Meta's dual-class structure, given that Comcast's Class B shares are convertible into Class A shares?",
      "answer": "At Comcast (CMCSA), Class A common stockholders hold 66 2/3% of the voting power while Class B common stockholders hold 33 1/3% of the voting power, with each Class B share entitled to 15 votes. Importantly, Comcast's Class B shares are convertible on a share-for-share basis into Class A shares. In contrast, Meta (META) reports having both Class A and Class B common stock outstanding, with 2,189,898,148 shares of Class A and 343,761,117 shares of Class B common stock as of January 24, 2025, though its specific voting power distribution isn't disclosed. The convertibility feature in Comcast's structure provides a mechanism for changing this voting balance, while no such conversion feature is mentioned in Meta's filing.",

      "question": "How does the absence of Class B common stock in CMCSA's 2023 equity structure affect the potential for dual-class stock consolidation compared to META's governance risks tied to its Class A common stock?",
      "answer": "CMCSA's 2023 financial statements show that it did not have any issued or outstanding Class B common stock, contrasting with META's dual-class structure where Class B stockholders retain significant voting control. META's governance risks include a 'controlled company' status that allows Class B stockholders to influence major corporate decisions, potentially harming the attractiveness of Class A common stock. The absence of Class B shares at CMCSA eliminates dual-class governance risks for its investors, offering a more straightforward equity structure compared to META's, where such risks are explicitly highlighted in its 10-K filing.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class B Common Stock: CMCSA had no issued or outstanding Class B common stock in 2023, indicating a lack of dual-class equity structure.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Class B shares, as seen in META, are convertible into Class A shares and often carry enhanced voting rights, creating governance asymmetries.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 META: META\u2019s Class A common stock is negatively impacted by its controlled company status, which limits board independence and investor protections, making the stock potentially less attractive."

      "answer": "Disney's 73% stake in National Geographic allows it to integrate National Geographic-branded programming directly into Disney+ as a top-level tile within the interface, providing exclusive access to content that is not subject to third-party licensing fees (chunk 1 and chunk 2). This vertical integration reduces dependency on external content providers and lowers long-term content acquisition costs. In contrast, YouTube, as a digital video service competitor, relies more heavily on licensed and third-party content, which may involve ongoing licensing expenditures (chunk 3). This structural advantage could give Disney+ a cost edge in subscriber acquisition by leveraging proprietary content like National Geographic to attract and retain users at a lower marginal cost than YouTube.",

        "Hop 3: Disney \u2190 GOOGL: YouTube (owned by Google) competes directly with Disney+ in digital video services, but relies more on licensed and third-party content, incurring higher ongoing content costs (chunk 3)."

COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme park and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruption of content production activities.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 related disruptions on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the currently unknowable duration and severity of COVID-19 and its variants, and among other things, governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests and talent.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairments totaling $5.0 billion, in part due to the negative impact COVID-19 has had on the International Channels business (see Note 18).\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\n\n## Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution\n\nDMED encompasses the Company's global film and episodic television content production and distribution activities. Content is distributed by a single organization across three significant lines of business: Linear Networks, Direct-toConsumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Content is generally created/licensed by four groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. The distribution organization has full accountability for the financial results of the entire media and entertainment business.\n\nThe operations of DMED's significant lines of business are as follows:\n\n- Linear Networks\n- Domestic Channels: ABC Television Network and eight owned ABC television stations (Broadcasting), and Disney, ESPN (80% interest), Freeform, FX and National Geographic (73% interest) branded domestic television networks (Cable)\n- International Channels: Disney, ESPN, Fox, National Geographic and Star branded television networks outside the U.S.\n- A 50% equity investment in A+E Television Networks (A+E), which operates a variety of cable channels including A&amp;E, HISTORY and Lifetime\n- Direct-to-Consumer\n- Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar, ESPN+ (68% effective interest), Hulu and Star+ direct-to-consumer (DTC) video streaming services\n- Content Sales/Licensing\n- Sale/licensing of film and television content to third-party television and subscription/advertising video-on-demand (TV/SVOD) services\n- Theatrical distribution\n- Home entertainment distribution (DVD, Blu-ray discs and electronic home video licenses)\n- Music distribution",

Alphabet's  investment  in  the  portfolio  of  Other  Bets  includes  emerging  businesses  at  various  stages  of  development, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nOther Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur  business  is  characterized  by  rapid  change  as  well  as  new  and  disruptive  technologies.  We  face  formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including from:\n\n- General  purpose  search  engines  and  information  services,  such  as  Baidu,  Microsoft's  Bing,  Naver,  Seznam, Yahoo, and Yandex.\n- Vertical search engines and e-commerce providers, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n- Social networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n- Other online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n- Other  forms  of  advertising,  such  as  billboards,  magazines,  newspapers,  radio,  and  television.  Our  advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n- Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n- Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of enterprise cloud services, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n- Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, ByteDance, Disney, Hulu, Meta, and Netflix.\n- Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products, such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Zoom.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

      "question": "How does the $62.2 billion in Alphabet's 2023 share repurchases of Class A and Class C stock impact the relative voting power of Class B shares, and how does this compare to META's strategy of maintaining unlisted Class B shares with concentrated stockholder control?",
      "answer": "Alphabet's 2023 repurchases of $62.2 billion in Class A and Class C shares reduce the total number of voting shares (Class A) in circulation, which indirectly increases the relative voting power of the remaining Class B shares since each Class B share carries 10 votes. This mirrors the structure seen at Comcast, where Class B shares maintain 33 1/3% of total voting power and are convertible to Class A shares. META, on the other hand, keeps its Class B shares unlisted and concentrated among a small group of 23 stockholders of record, effectively preserving control within a core group without exposing those shares to public market dilution. Both companies use Class B shares to concentrate voting control, but META reinforces this by keeping those shares off public exchanges entirely.",

        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Alphabet repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023, reducing the number of publicly traded voting shares.",

        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 META: META maintains 23 stockholders of record for its Class B common stock, which is not publicly listed, preserving concentrated control and avoiding dilution in a manner distinct from but conceptually aligned with structural voting power preservation."

      "question": "Given that Alphabet repurchased $62.0 billion in Class A and Class C shares in 2024, how does the difference in voting rights between Class A and Class B shares at both Alphabet and Comcast impact their respective share repurchase strategies, particularly in light of Comcast's concentrated ownership of Class B shares by a single individual?",
      "answer": "Alphabet's share repurchase strategy in 2024 focused on Class A and Class C shares, with $62.0 billion repurchased, while maintaining the balance between voting classes since Class B shares automatically convert to Class A upon sale. This preserves the concentrated voting power of Class B holders. Similarly, Comcast's Class B shares, which carry 15 votes per share and represent 33\u2153% of the combined voting power, are entirely owned by Brian L. Roberts. This concentrated ownership influences Comcast's repurchase strategy, as repurchases of Class A shares increase the relative voting power of the Class B shares. Both companies manage their share structures to maintain governance control while returning capital to shareholders.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Alphabet repurchased $62.0 billion in Class A and Class C shares in 2024, with Class B shares automatically converting to Class A upon sale or transfer, preserving voting control.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: At both Alphabet and Comcast, Class B shares carry significantly more voting power than Class A shares, with Comcast\u2019s Class B shares having 15 votes per share and representing 33\u2153% of total voting power.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: Comcast\u2019s Class B shares are entirely owned by Brian L. Roberts, giving him concentrated voting control, which influences the company\u2019s share repurchase decisions as retiring Class A shares increases his relative influence."

Stockholders' Equity\n\n## Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\n\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to v oting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share.  Each share of  Class  B common stock is entitled to 10  v otes  per  share.  Class  C  capital  stock  has no  v oting  rights,  except  as required by applicable law . Shares of Class B common stock may be conv erted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically conv ert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we continued to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prev ailing market conditions, including the relativ e trading prices and v olumes of the Class A and Class C shares. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we repurchased $59.3 billion, $62.2 billion, and $62.0 billion, respectiv ely, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.\n\nIn April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2024, $44.7 billion remained av ailable for Class A and Class C share repurchases.\n\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\n\n",

The  Class  B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation.

Each share of Class B Common Stock at CMCSA is entitled to 15 votes. In contrast, at GOOGL, each share of Class B Common Stock is entitled to 10 votes, and there is no restriction on dilution like in CMCSA. This shows that CMCSA provides stronger voting rights to Class B shares with a non-dilutable structure, whereas GOOGL offers fewer votes per share without non-dilution protection.",

Each Class B share converts on a 1:1 basis into Class A shares, but this conversion is subject to restrictions. Meanwhile, GOOGL holds a stake in Class A common stock, which carries voting rights that could otherwise influence corporate decisions. However, due to CMCSA's structural protections, even if all Class B shares were converted to Class A, the non-dilutable voting safeguard would still preserve the 33 1/3% voting control, limiting GOOGL\u2019s ability to shift governance outcomes through its Class A stake alone.",

      "question": "How might the differences in contract modification practices between VZ and T impact their financial exposure during the transition away from LIBOR, given the relief provided by ASU 2020-04?",
      "answer": "VZ disclosed that contract modifications impact the timing of revenue recognition for unsatisfied performance obligations, which totaled $25.7 billion expected for 2024. T, like VZ, applied ASU 2020-04 for contract modifications triggered by reference rate reform such as the transition away from LIBOR. ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients that reduce the financial and operational impacts of replacing reference rates affected by reform. While VZ focused on revenue recognition timing changes due to contract modifications, T emphasized that adoption of ASU 2020-04 did not materially impact its financial statements. Both companies leveraged the relief provided by ASU 2020-04 for LIBOR transition-related modifications, but VZ faces larger financial exposure through its $25.7 billion of 2024 performance obligations that could be affected by such modifications.",

      "answer": "Slack faced securities litigation related to its IPO, where a motion to dismiss was partially granted and partially denied in 2020, followed by a Ninth Circuit reversal in 2025 that led to the dismissal of the complaint with prejudice, significantly reducing its legal exposure. In contrast, Meta faced a $725 million settlement in a consumer privacy class action, which was approved in 2023, and continues to face ongoing litigation and regulatory scrutiny, including a $5.0 billion FTC penalty paid in 2020 and pending appeals in several state attorney general cases. Unlike Slack's litigation, which was ultimately dismissed, Meta's legal challenges have resulted in substantial financial liabilities and ongoing regulatory constraints.",

AI has been used in Google Workspace for years to improv e grammar, efficiency, security, and more with features like Smart Reply, Smart Compose, and malware and phishing protection in Gmail. Now , Gemini for Google Workspace brings our AI-powered agents into Gmail, Docs, Sheets and more to help users write, organize, v isualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings.\n\n## Other Bets\n\nAcross Alphabet, we are also using technology to try to solv e big problems that affect a wide v ariety of industries, including transportation and health technology. Alphabet's inv estment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at v arious stages of dev elopment, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriv ing, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside inv estors. While these earlystage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating rev enue and making important strides in their industries. Rev enues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related serv ices, and internet serv ices.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptiv e technologies.

Legal Proceedings and Claims\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is or may be involved in various legal or regulatory proceedings, claims or purported class actions related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour and other claims. The Company has been, and may in the future be, put on notice or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement.\n\nIn general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Company's financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Company's reputation and future operating results.\n\nThe Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. The outcomes of legal proceedings and other contingencies are, however, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. At this time, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible losses in excess of any amounts accrued, including losses that could arise as a result of application of non-monetary remedies, with respect to the contingencies it faces, and the Company's estimates may not prove to be accurate.\n\nIn management's opinion, resolution of all current matters, including those described below, is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial statements. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, payment or other contingency, the resolution of a matter could materially affect the Company's current or future results of operations or cash flows, or both, in a particular quarter.\n\n## Slack Litigation\n\nBeginning in September 2019, seven purported class action lawsuits were filed against Slack, its directors, certain of its officers and certain investment funds associated with certain of its directors, each alleging violations of securities laws in connection with Slack's registration statement on Form S-1 (the 'Registration Statement') filed with the SEC. All but one of these actions were filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Mateo, though one plaintiff originally filed in the County of San Francisco before refiling in the County of San Mateo (and the original San Francisco action was dismissed). The remaining action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the 'Federal Action'). In the Federal Action, captioned Dennee v. Slack Technologies, Inc., Case No. 3:19-CV-05857-SI, Slack and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in January 2020. In April 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. In May 2020, Slack and the other defendants filed a motion to certify the court's order for interlocutory appeal, which the court granted. Slack and the other defendants filed a petition for permission to appeal the district court's order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which was granted in July 2020. Oral argument was heard in May 2021. On September 20, 2021, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling. Slack filed a petition for rehearing with the Ninth Circuit on November 3, 2021, which was denied on May 2, 2022. Slack filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on August 31, 2022, which was granted on December 13, 2022. On June 1, 2023, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision vacating the Ninth Circuit's decision and remanded for further proceedings. The Ninth Circuit ordered the parties to submit additional briefing in light of the Supreme Court's decision. On February 10, 2025, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court's order and instructing the district court to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. The state court actions were consolidated in November 2019, and the consolidated action is captioned In re Slack Technologies, Inc. Shareholder Litigation, Lead Case No. 19CIV05370 (the 'State Court Action'). An additional state court action was filed in San Mateo County in June 2020 but was consolidated with the State Court Action in July 2020. Slack and the other defendants filed demurrers to the complaint in the State Court Action in February 2020. In August 2020, the court sustained in part and overruled in part the demurrers, and granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint, which they filed in October 2020. Slack and the other defendants answered the complaint in November 2020. Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on October 21, 2021, which remains pending. On October 26, 2022, the court stayed the State Court Action pending resolution of Slack's petition for a writ of certiorari in the Federal Action. The State Court Action remains stayed pending resolution of the appellate proceedings in the Federal Action. The Federal Action and the State Court Action seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief on",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Privacy and Related Matters\n\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging various causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. With respect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In re Facebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation ). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative consumer class action.  On  December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $725 million by us.  The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. Two objectors appealed final approval (one of which was voluntarily dismissed as of June 24, 2024). The objection is fully briefed and will be heard on February 7, 2025. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness  of  the  modified  consent  order.  The  state  attorneys  general  inquiries  and  litigation  and  certain  government  inquiries  in  other  jurisdictions  remain ongoing. On June 1, 2023, the court presiding over the lawsuit filed by the District of Columbia granted our motion for summary judgment, resolving the case in our favor. On June 29, 2023, the District of Columbia filed a notice of appeal. The appeal is fully briefed and will be heard on January 30, 2025. Trial in the New Mexico Attorney General's case is scheduled to begin on December 1, 2025. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc. Derivative Litigation . On January 19, 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10, 2023. The insider trading claim was dismissed as to all defendants except Mark Zuckerberg, and the motion was denied as to the breach of fiduciary duty claims. Trial is scheduled to begin on April 2, 2025.\n\nOn May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding ( In the Matter of Facebook, Inc. ) seeking substantial changes to the modified consent order, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a proposed order and include,  among others,  a  prohibition  on  our  use  of  minors'  data  for  any  commercial  purposes,  changes  to  the  composition  of  our  board  of  directors,  and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( USA v. Facebook, Inc. ) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent order. On November 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ( U.S. v. Facebook, Inc. ) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding pending resolution of the appeal. Our motion for a stay pending appeal was denied in March 2024. The underlying appeal was then briefed and oral argument was held on November 5, 2024. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has yet to rule.\n\nOn November 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC ),  asserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On December 13, 2023, the FTC filed an opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 14, 2024, the district court denied our motion to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation, and also denied the FTC's motion to dismiss our complaint without prejudice, pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in SEC v. Jarkesy ( Jarkesy ). Our motion for a stay of the FTC proceeding pending appeal was denied in March 2024. Both the district court action and the appeal were stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in Jarkesy . Following the Supreme Court's ruling in Jarkesy on June 27, 2024, the government filed a renewed motion to dismiss, which was fully briefed as of October 18, 2024. The district court has yet to rule. The parties are required to report back to the circuit court within 30 days of the district court's disposition of the FTC's motion to dismiss.",

In contrast, NFLX's common stockholders, such as holders of Class A shares, have full voting rights with one vote per share on all matters. This creates a significant disparity in governance influence, with NFLX common stockholders having broad voting control while T\u2019s influence through Series B Preferred Stock is restricted to specific corporate actions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NFLX \u2192 Voting Rights: NFLX common stockholders (e.g., Class A) are entitled to one vote per share on all matters, giving them broad governance influence.",
        "Hop 2: Voting Rights \u2192 Series B Preferred Stock: Series B Preferred Stock, as outlined in the governance documents, grants holders no general voting rights and only limited voting power in defined circumstances such as certain mergers or consolidations.",
        "Hop 3: Series B Preferred Stock \u2190 T: T holds Series B Preferred Stock, as evidenced by the Certificate of Designations filed in its 2023 10-K, which defines the limited voting rights associated with this stake."

      "answer": "CMCSA competes in Europe with DTC and OTT streaming providers for video services, particularly in content acquisition and advertising. Meanwhile, Disney includes a Star-branded tile in Disney+ services outside the U.S. and Latin America, offering general entertainment programming as part of its DTC strategy. DIS owns and operates Star-branded international television networks across multiple regions, which strengthens its global DTC footprint. This indicates that while CMCSA competes broadly in the European DTC space, Disney leverages its Star international assets to bundle content and expand its Disney+ services, creating a layered competitive dynamic.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ntelevision  and  the  internet.  Our  home  service  group  performs  various  tasks,  including  installations,  servicing  and  upgrades  of customer premise equipment. Customers can use self-service help and support and perform self-installations for certain services.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete with a broad range of companies engaged in media, entertainment and communications services in Europe. For video services,  we  compete  with  cable  operators,  providers  of  both  paid-for  and  free-to-air  programming,  other  satellite  television providers, digital terrestrial television providers, content aggregators, home entertainment products companies, and other suppliers and providers of sports, entertainment, news and information that deliver DTC and other OTT streaming services. For broadband and wireless services, we compete with service providers making use of new fiber-optic networks, telecommunications providers, other  internet  service  providers  and  companies  developing  new  technologies  and  devices.  Our  competitive  position  may  be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of, or developments in, the means of delivery competitors use to provide their services as well as lowered prices, product innovations, new technologies or different value creation approaches. We also compete with organizations that are publicly funded, in whole or in part, to fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate.\n\nOur owned channels compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other television networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost for such content is significant.\n\nWe compete for the  sale  of  advertising  with  other  television  networks  and  stations,  digital  platforms,  and  all  other  advertising platforms. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from  us  may  be  adversely  affected  by  declines  in  television  viewership  and  the  increasing  number  of  entertainment  choices available.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, including Sky Glass and XClass TV, which launched in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sky Glass and XClass TV are smart televisions with operating systems that leverage our global technology platforms similar to Sky Q, X1 and Flex. We sell Sky Glass televisions in Europe, with the United Kingdom as the first market, to consumers that also subscribe to Sky's video services. XClass TVs are manufactured and sold by third parties and operate on our XClass TV operating system.\n\n## Seasonality and Cyclicality\n\nEach of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Cable Communications' results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year.\n\nRevenue  and  operating  costs  and  expenses  (comprised  of  total  costs  and  expenses,  excluding  depreciation  and  amortization expense) in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees.\n\nRevenue in Cable Communications, Media and Sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the United States is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season, and advertising related  to  candidates  running  for  political  office  and  issue-oriented  advertising,  respectively.  Revenue  in  Media  also  fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. Advertising revenue in Sky typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition in the summer during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup . TM\n\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms, including viewing on demand, DTC platforms or OTT service providers. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. We incur",

COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme park and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruption of content production activities.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 related disruptions on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the currently unknowable duration and severity of COVID-19 and its variants, and among other things, governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests and talent.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairments totaling $5.0 billion, in part due to the negative impact COVID-19 has had on the International Channels business (see Note 18).\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\n\n## Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution\n\nDMED encompasses the Company's global film and episodic television content production and distribution activities. Content is distributed by a single organization across three significant lines of business: Linear Networks, Direct-toConsumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Content is generally created/licensed by four groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. The distribution organization has full accountability for the financial results of the entire media and entertainment business.\n\nThe operations of DMED's significant lines of business are as follows:\n\n- Linear Networks\n- Domestic Channels: ABC Television Network and eight owned ABC television stations (Broadcasting), and Disney, ESPN (80% interest), Freeform, FX and National Geographic (73% interest) branded domestic television networks (Cable)\n- International Channels: Disney, ESPN, Fox, National Geographic and Star branded television networks outside the U.S.\n- A 50% equity investment in A+E Television Networks (A+E), which operates a variety of cable channels including A&amp;E, HISTORY and Lifetime\n- Direct-to-Consumer\n- Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar, ESPN+ (68% effective interest), Hulu and Star+ direct-to-consumer (DTC) video streaming services\n- Content Sales/Licensing\n- Sale/licensing of film and television content to third-party television and subscription/advertising video-on-demand (TV/SVOD) services\n- Theatrical distribution\n- Home entertainment distribution (DVD, Blu-ray discs and electronic home video licenses)\n- Music distribution",

In contrast, GOOGL has a multi-tiered voting rights structure where Class C Capital Stock holders have no voting rights except as required by law.

      "answer": "GOOGL maintains a multi-tier voting structure where Class A shares receive 1 vote and Class B shares receive 10 votes per share, with $62.2 billion spent on share repurchases in 2023 that primarily targeted Class A and Class C shares (which have no voting rights). This repurchase strategy combined with the weighted voting structure could consolidate control among insiders who hold Class B shares. In contrast, NFLX explicitly states that all common stockholders receive one vote per share with no distinction in voting rights, creating a more egalitarian governance framework where no shareholder class has disproportionate influence. The CHTR evidence shows that multi-class structures with differentiated voting rights are industry-disclosed practices, but NFLX chooses not to implement such a structure, suggesting different strategic approaches to corporate governance.",

      "question": "How does Alphabet's share repurchase strategy prioritize certain stock classes relative to their conversion rights, and what might this imply about potential voting control considerations given that Class A shares are also publicly traded by another major corporation?",
      "answer": "Alphabet repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023, with $36.3 billion remaining available under the repurchase authorization as of December 31, 2023. Notably, Class B common stock\u2014which carries 10 votes per share\u2014can be converted to Class A shares at the stockholder's option or automatically upon sale or transfer. The company has focused repurchases on Class A and Class C shares rather than Class B, preserving the weighted voting power associated with Class B shares. Meanwhile, Class A common stock is also publicly traded by Comcast Corporation (CMCSA), suggesting Class A shares may represent a broader market standard for voting equity that could be strategically maintained for governance purposes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Alphabet's Class B shares carry 10 votes per share and may be converted to Class A shares either voluntarily or upon sale, directly linking ownership structure to voting rights.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: The conversion mechanism allows Class B shareholders to become Class A shareholders, aligning economic interests while reducing voting influence, which may be a factor in why repurchases have targeted Class A shares.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: Comcast Corporation also issues Class A Common Stock, suggesting a standardization or market alignment in share structure that could influence Alphabet\u2019s decision to focus repurchases on Class A shares."

      "question": "How does the dual-class stock structure at META, which gives Class B shareholders disproportionate voting control, compare to CMCSA's dual-class framework in terms of potential impact on investor confidence, especially given CMCSA's Class B to Class A conversion mechanism?",
      "answer": "META's dual-class stock structure gives Class B shareholders, such as Mark Zuckerberg, disproportionate voting control, which could make its Class A common stock less attractive to some investors. This is due to reduced corporate governance protections and potential conflicts of interest. Similarly, CMCSA has a dual-class framework where Class B common stockholders hold 33\u2153% of the voting power, and each share of Class B stock is convertible, share for share, into Class A stock. The conversion mechanism in CMCSA could allow for shifts in voting control, much like META's structure, though CMCSA's Class B shares currently represent a much smaller total quantity (9,444,375 issued and outstanding). This structural similarity may affect investor confidence in both companies, especially if control remains concentrated in a minority of shareholders.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class B Common Stock: CMCSA discloses details about its Class B common stock, including that it has 9,444,375 shares issued and outstanding, each with 15 votes, and that these shares are convertible into Class A common stock.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: The Class B shares in CMCSA have 33\u2153% of the total voting power, and their conversion into Class A shares could influence voting control dynamics, as Class A shareholders collectively hold 66\u2154% of the voting power.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 META: META\u2019s Class A common stock is impacted by its controlled company status, where Class B shareholders have significant voting control, potentially making Class A stock less attractive to investors due to reduced governance protections."

      "question": "How does the voting power distribution in CMCSA's Class B common stock, which is entirely owned by Brian L. Roberts, relate to the repurchase activity and voting structure of GOOGL's Class A and Class B common stock, given the interplay between their respective share classes and repurchase programs?",
      "answer": "In CMCSA, Class B common stock has 15 votes per share and represents 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, which is entirely owned by Brian L. Roberts. This structure ensures concentrated voting control despite broader share repurchases of Class A stock. Similarly, GOOGL\u2019s Class A shares carry one vote each, while Class B shares have 10 votes per share, and the company repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023, with $36.3 billion remaining under the repurchase authorization. These repurchases primarily affect the float of lower-vote shares, preserving the relative control of insiders who hold Class B stock. Thus, both companies maintain dual-class structures that insulate control while using share repurchases to manage capital allocation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class A Common Stock: GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023, with $36.3 billion remaining under the repurchase authorization, indicating a strategic focus on managing share count and capital structure.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: In CMCSA, Class B common stock has 15 votes per share and represents 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, which is non-dilutable and entirely owned by Brian L. Roberts, creating a concentrated control mechanism.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: CMCSA\u2019s Class B common stock is a key governance feature that maintains control for insiders, even as the company repurchases Class A shares, which have fewer voting rights."

      "answer": "AT&T utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts as part of its derivative transactions to manage foreign currency exchange risk, though specific notional amounts are not disclosed. In contrast, Disney discloses a notional exposure of $9.9 billion for its foreign exchange cash flow hedges as of September 28, 2024, and hedges forecasted transactions for periods generally not exceeding four years. This indicates that while both companies use similar instruments, Disney provides more detailed quantitative exposure and a defined time horizon for its hedging activities.",

        "Hop 1: T (AT&T) \u2192 Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts: AT&T enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange risk, though no specific notional amounts are disclosed.",
        "Hop 2: Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts \u2192 Forecasted Transactions: These contracts are used to hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions, protecting against earnings and cash flow fluctuations due to exchange rate changes.",

      "answer": "CMCSA's Class B Common Stock has limited voting rights, only allowing votes on specific matters such as exiting the core payments business, certain consolidation or merger transactions, or amendments to the certificate of incorporation, and votes are calculated by multiplying shares held by the applicable conversion rate. In contrast, NFLX grants one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders, providing more generalized voting power. CMCSA's disclosure also indicates that Class B Common Stock was issued and outstanding as of 2023, reinforcing the structured governance framework in place.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class B Common Stock: CMCSA disclosed that Class B Common Stock was issued and outstanding in 2023, with 9,444,375 shares, indicating active governance implications.",

      "answer": "Disney's Val d'Europe near Disneyland Paris includes hotels with approximately 5,750 rooms operated by third parties on land leased or purchased from the company, reflecting a strategy of leveraging third-party operators to expand resort infrastructure while maintaining land control. In contrast, Comcast owns Universal Beijing Resort directly, which includes on-site themed hotels, indicating a more direct investment approach in resort infrastructure. Both strategies aim to enhance guest experiences through expanded lodging options, but Disney emphasizes third-party partnerships while Comcast opts for direct ownership.",

      "answer": "Disney's 73% ownership stake in National Geographic provides it with editorial control and exclusive access to National Geographic's premium documentary and nature content. This content is directly integrated into the Disney+ interface as a top-level branded tile, enhancing the platform's content differentiation and appeal to subscribers. This strategic content advantage enables Disney to position Disney+ as a unique offering in the digital video services market. Google, as a competitor in this space, must rely on licensed or internally produced content for its platforms, while Disney leverages proprietary, high-value content like National Geographic to differentiate its service and compete more effectively against platforms like YouTube and Google's other video offerings.",

Alphabet's  investment  in  the  portfolio  of  Other  Bets  includes  emerging  businesses  at  various  stages  of  development, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nOther Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur  business  is  characterized  by  rapid  change  as  well  as  new  and  disruptive  technologies.  We  face  formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including from:\n\n- General  purpose  search  engines  and  information  services,  such  as  Baidu,  Microsoft's  Bing,  Naver,  Seznam, Yahoo, and Yandex.\n- Vertical search engines and e-commerce providers, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n- Social networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n- Other online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n- Other  forms  of  advertising,  such  as  billboards,  magazines,  newspapers,  radio,  and  television.  Our  advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n- Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n- Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of enterprise cloud services, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n- Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, ByteDance, Disney, Hulu, Meta, and Netflix.\n- Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products, such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Zoom.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme park and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruption of content production activities.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 related disruptions on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the currently unknowable duration and severity of COVID-19 and its variants, and among other things, governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests and talent.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairments totaling $5.0 billion, in part due to the negative impact COVID-19 has had on the International Channels business (see Note 18).\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\n\n## Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution\n\nDMED encompasses the Company's global film and episodic television content production and distribution activities. Content is distributed by a single organization across three significant lines of business: Linear Networks, Direct-toConsumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Content is generally created/licensed by four groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. The distribution organization has full accountability for the financial results of the entire media and entertainment business.\n\nThe operations of DMED's significant lines of business are as follows:\n\n- Linear Networks\n- Domestic Channels: ABC Television Network and eight owned ABC television stations (Broadcasting), and Disney, ESPN (80% interest), Freeform, FX and National Geographic (73% interest) branded domestic television networks (Cable)\n- International Channels: Disney, ESPN, Fox, National Geographic and Star branded television networks outside the U.S.\n- A 50% equity investment in A+E Television Networks (A+E), which operates a variety of cable channels including A&amp;E, HISTORY and Lifetime\n- Direct-to-Consumer\n- Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar, ESPN+ (68% effective interest), Hulu and Star+ direct-to-consumer (DTC) video streaming services\n- Content Sales/Licensing\n- Sale/licensing of film and television content to third-party television and subscription/advertising video-on-demand (TV/SVOD) services\n- Theatrical distribution\n- Home entertainment distribution (DVD, Blu-ray discs and electronic home video licenses)\n- Music distribution",

      "question": "How does the voting power distribution tied to Class B common stock conversion mechanisms at CMCSA compare with the share repurchase strategy for Class A and Class C shares at GOOGL, given the differing impacts on equity structure and shareholder control?",
      "answer": "At CMCSA, Class B common stockholders control 33 1/3% of the voting power, which is non-dilutable and convertible share-for-share into Class A common stock, while the voting power of Class A shares depends on the total number of Class A and Class B shares outstanding. This structure ensures continued influence by Class B holders. In contrast, GOOGL has repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023, with an additional $36.3 billion remaining under the repurchase authorization. These repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, increasing the proportional ownership of remaining shareholders, including those holding Class B shares, which carry 10 votes per share. Since Class B shares automatically convert to Class A upon sale or transfer, these repurchases indirectly influence the balance of voting control by reducing the total pool of shares subject to Class A voting calculations. Thus, while CMCSA\u2019s structure protects Class B voting power through fixed percentages and conversion rules, GOOGL\u2019s equity control dynamics are shaped by aggressive repurchases that affect the relative ownership and voting influence of remaining shareholders.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairo s as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. Certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf are accounted for as advances and classified within other investments. Atairos may pledge our remaining unfunded capital commitment as security to lenders in connection with certain financing arrangements.  This has no effect on our funding commitments. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n\nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made cash capital contributions totaling $73 million, $145 million, and $52 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment, inclusive of advances classified within other investments, was $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.\n\n## Hulu and Collateralized Obligation\n\nIn  2019,  we  entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  with  The  Walt  Disney  Company  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries,  whereby  we  relinquished  our  board  seats  and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. Concurrent with these agreements, we also acquired additional ownership interest in Hulu previously held by AT&amp;T. Following these transactions, our interest was approximately 33% and we had the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of future equity capital calls. The agreements included put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we could require Disney to buy, and Disney could require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu. In the third quarter of 2023, we amended these agreements and agreed, among other things, that the put/call provisions regarding our interest could be exercised in November 2023 (in addition to subsequent periods) and that we would fund our share of prior equity capital calls if the put/call was ex ercised in November 2023.\n\nIn November 2023, we exercised our put right requiring Disney to purchase our interest in Hulu. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Disney paid us $8.6 billion, representing $9.2 billion for our share of Hulu's minimum equity value, less $557 million for our share of prior capital calls. Additional proceeds for any ex cess of the fair value of our interest over the $9.2 billion minimum equity value will be due following final determination of Hulu's fair value pursuant to a third-party appraisal process. In connection with the transaction, Disney also agreed to share with us 50% of the future tax benefits resulting from the purchase of our interest in Hulu. Because we continue to hold our interest in Hulu, the $9.2 billion payment from Disney is treated as an advance on the sale of our interest, which will be recognized following the finalization of the appraisal process. The receipt of the minimum proceeds resulted in a tax gain in 2023. The recorded value of our investment in Hulu of $883 million and $863 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, continues to reflect our historical cost in applying the equity method, and therefore, is less than its fair value.\n\nIn 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility, which was fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. The term loan was due at the earlier of March 2024 or upon receipt of the proceeds under the put/call provisions and was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe present the advance on the sale of our  investment  and  the  term  loan  separately  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  in  the  captions  'advance  on  sale  of investment' and 'collateralized obligation,' respectively.\n\n## Marketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify investments with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as marketable equity securities and the carrying values are primarily presented in other current assets. The changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities between measurement dates are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The fair values of our marketable equity securities are based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market prices.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "Netflix's common stock structure grants one vote per share for all common stockholders, with no distinction among classes of common stock, giving broad voting rights to all shareholders on all matters. In contrast, Alphabet's structure concentrates voting power by granting Class B common stockholders 10 votes per share, while Class A common stockholders receive only one vote per share, effectively limiting broader shareholder influence over corporate governance decisions. This creates a disparity in control, where Alphabet's Class B holders, typically insiders, maintain outsized influence over governance matters compared to Netflix's more evenly distributed voting rights.",

      "question": "How does Alphabet's retention of voting control through Class A and Class B stock structure in 2024 compare to Comcast's strategic relinquishment of voting rights in Hulu, and what were the respective financial impacts on each company's capital structure?",

In contrast, Comcast relinquished substantially all voting rights in Hulu in 2019 when Disney assumed full operational control, which directly led to Comcast exercising a put right in November 2023 to sell its interest for a minimum equity value of $9.2 billion, receiving $8.6 billion in proceeds after funding prior capital calls. Alphabet's structure preserved governance control while optimizing capital through targeted share repurchases, whereas Comcast's loss of voting rights preceded the full exit of its Hulu investment, resulting in a $5.1 billion investment balance as of December 31, 2024, down from $5.5 billion in 2023, with only future tax benefits retained.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairo s as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. Certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf are accounted for as advances and classified within other investments. Atairos may pledge our remaining unfunded capital commitment as security to lenders in connection with certain financing arrangements.  This has no effect on our funding commitments. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n\nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made cash capital contributions totaling $73 million, $145 million, and $52 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment, inclusive of advances classified within other investments, was $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.\n\n## Hulu and Collateralized Obligation\n\nIn  2019,  we  entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  with  The  Walt  Disney  Company  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries,  whereby  we  relinquished  our  board  seats  and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. Concurrent with these agreements, we also acquired additional ownership interest in Hulu previously held by AT&amp;T. Following these transactions, our interest was approximately 33% and we had the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of future equity capital calls. The agreements included put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we could require Disney to buy, and Disney could require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu. In the third quarter of 2023, we amended these agreements and agreed, among other things, that the put/call provisions regarding our interest could be exercised in November 2023 (in addition to subsequent periods) and that we would fund our share of prior equity capital calls if the put/call was ex ercised in November 2023.\n\nIn November 2023, we exercised our put right requiring Disney to purchase our interest in Hulu. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Disney paid us $8.6 billion, representing $9.2 billion for our share of Hulu's minimum equity value, less $557 million for our share of prior capital calls. Additional proceeds for any ex cess of the fair value of our interest over the $9.2 billion minimum equity value will be due following final determination of Hulu's fair value pursuant to a third-party appraisal process. In connection with the transaction, Disney also agreed to share with us 50% of the future tax benefits resulting from the purchase of our interest in Hulu. Because we continue to hold our interest in Hulu, the $9.2 billion payment from Disney is treated as an advance on the sale of our interest, which will be recognized following the finalization of the appraisal process. The receipt of the minimum proceeds resulted in a tax gain in 2023. The recorded value of our investment in Hulu of $883 million and $863 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, continues to reflect our historical cost in applying the equity method, and therefore, is less than its fair value.\n\nIn 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility, which was fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. The term loan was due at the earlier of March 2024 or upon receipt of the proceeds under the put/call provisions and was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe present the advance on the sale of our  investment  and  the  term  loan  separately  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  in  the  captions  'advance  on  sale  of investment' and 'collateralized obligation,' respectively.\n\n## Marketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify investments with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as marketable equity securities and the carrying values are primarily presented in other current assets. The changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities between measurement dates are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The fair values of our marketable equity securities are based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market prices.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Meanwhile, Alphabet has actively repurchased both Class A and Class C shares, with $62.0 billion repurchased in 2024 alone, and has $44.7 billion remaining in its repurchase authorization. Since Class B shares automatically convert to Class A upon sale or transfer, Alphabet\u2019s repurchase strategy may indirectly affect the float of Class A shares, creating a dynamic where CMCSA\u2019s Class B structure contrasts with Alphabet\u2019s share reduction efforts, potentially influencing ownership concentration and liquidity differently across the two firms.",

      "answer": "Netflix's common stockholders are entitled to one vote per share, as disclosed in their 2024 10-K. This aligns with Charter Communications' description of Class A common stock, which also grants one vote per share, while Charter's Class B common stock provides multiple votes tied to economic interests. Similarly, Alphabet (GOOGL) structures its voting rights by granting one vote per share for Class A common stock and ten votes per share for Class B common stock, with Class C capital stock having no voting rights. Thus, both Netflix and Alphabet's Class A shares offer limited voting rights compared to their respective Class B shares, a distinction Charter also reflects between its Class A and Class B stock.",

      "answer": "NFLX's common stock provides one vote per share, creating a uniform voting structure across all shareholders. In contrast, META's dual-class structure grants 10 votes per share to Class B stockholders, such as Mark Zuckerberg, giving him disproportionate control even if he owns a minority of shares. This governance model increases the risk of concentrated decision-making and may deter investors concerned about lack of board independence or takeover protections, as META qualifies as a 'controlled company' under Nasdaq rules. These differences suggest that META's structure poses higher governance risk compared to NFLX's more egalitarian voting rights framework.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NFLX \u2192 Voting Rights: NFLX's common stock provides one vote per share, ensuring equal voting power across all shareholders.",
        "Hop 2: Voting Rights \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Class A shares, as seen in other companies like Alphabet, typically carry one vote per share, aligning with standard voting structures.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 META: META's Class A shares have limited voting rights compared to Class B shares, which carry 10 votes each, allowing the controlling stockholder to maintain decision-making power."

      "answer": "GOOGL's Class B common stock carries 10 votes per share and can be voluntarily or automatically converted into Class A common stock, which has only 1 vote per share. In contrast, CMCSA's Class B common stock has 15 votes per share and is convertible share-for-share into Class A common stock, where the voting rights of Class A shares depend on the total outstanding shares of both classes, but Class B holds a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the total voting power. This highlights a more concentrated voting control mechanism in CMCSA compared to GOOGL.",

      "answer": "META's dual-class stock structure grants Class B shares 10 votes per share compared to one vote per share for Class A shares, which could depress the trading price of its Class A common stock due to concerns about corporate governance and control by major stockholders. In contrast, NFLX provides one vote per share for all common stockholders, ensuring a uniform voting rights framework. GOOGL's equity structure, where Class A shares have one vote and Class B shares have 10 votes per share, mirrors META's dual-class approach and serves as a benchmark for analyzing the implications of such governance models on investor appeal and stock valuation.",

      "question": "How does the voting power disparity between Class A and Class B common stock at CMCSA compare to GOOGL's structure, given CMCSA's issuance of 9,444,375 Class B shares and GOOGL's 10:1 voting rights ratio for Class B shares?",
      "answer": "CMCSA's Class B common stock has no voting rights, as indicated by the absence of voting privileges in their equity structure, while GOOGL's Class B shares carry 10 votes per share, creating a significant disparity in shareholder influence. CMCSA issued 9,444,375 Class B shares in 2024, which remain non-voting except for limited circumstances. In contrast, GOOGL's Class B common stockholders maintain outsized voting power, with each share entitled to 10 votes, allowing certain shareholders to retain control despite holding fewer economic interests. This structural contrast means that while CMCSA's Class B shareholders have no general voting influence, GOOGL's Class B holders wield substantial governance power.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class A Common Stock: CMCSA issued 4,651,093,045 Class A shares and 9,444,375 Class B shares in 2024, with Class A shareholders having full voting rights and Class B shareholders having no general voting rights.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: The distinction in voting rights between Class A and Class B shares at CMCSA is codified in governance structures, with Class B shares only voting in limited circumstances, unlike Class A shares which vote on all matters.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 GOOGL: GOOGL's Class B common stockholders receive 10 votes per share, significantly enhancing their governance influence compared to their economic stake, contrasting sharply with CMCSA's non-voting Class B structure."

      "answer": "T's postretirement assets include $11 billion allocated to real estate funds, which are measured at net asset value (NAV) with distributions dependent on the monetization of underlying assets. These funds include investments in hotels, as specified in the second chunk. CMCSA is actively investing in new hotels and theme park attractions, such as Epic Universe opening in 2025. Given the non-redeemable structure of these funds, any changes in the performance or valuation of CMCSA's hotel developments could directly influence the NAV of the real estate funds. This, in turn, would affect the fair value of T's postretirement assets, as the ultimate realization of value depends on the successful monetization of these underlying real estate investments.",

Reels is a core component of the Facebook app, which is central to META's advertising business, generating substantially all of its revenue. Meanwhile, CMCSA competes directly with META in the online content and advertising space, particularly against META's social networking platform. Given that META's advertising revenue is already affected by product changes like Reels that reduce targeting capabilities and ad prominence, the lower monetization rate of Reels could further constrain revenue growth at a time when CMCSA and other competitors are vying for the same advertising dollars, especially in fragmented and competitive digital markets.",

      "answer": "VZ reports holding $12 million in international bonds as part of its fixed income securities, which are valued using market-based pricing including broker quotes and yield curves. DIS, in turn, relies on fixed income as a core component of its pension asset strategy, factoring in long-term return estimates from this asset class to shape its pension liability assumptions. While VZ's valuation of international bonds focuses on observable market inputs, DIS incorporates forward-looking return expectations on fixed income to estimate pension costs, highlighting distinct applications of fixed income instruments in corporate financial planning.",

The total market value of each of the Investment Funds is determined by aggregating the value of the underlying assets less liabilities. |\n| Private equity: Investments in private or public securities typically through privately-negotiated and/or structured transactions, including leveraged buyouts, venture capital, and distressed debt.                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Private credit: Investments focused on debt instruments, of which returns are driven by income rather than capital appreciation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Infrastructure: Investments in real assets, typically with long-term, predictable, and stable cash flows and a meaningful income component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

(1)\n\n## Assumptions\n\nAssumptions, such as discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets and the healthcare cost trend rate, have a significant effect on the amounts reported for net periodic benefit cost as well as the related benefit obligations.\n\nDiscount Rate - The assumed discount rate for pension and postretirement medical plans reflects the market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. The Company's discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans' liability cash flows to the yield curves. The Company measures service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows.\n\nLong-term rate of return on plan assets - The long-term rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities, fix ed income and alternative investments. When determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company considers long-term rates of return on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which the Company expects the pension funds to be invested. The following longterm rates of return by asset class were considered in setting the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption:\n\n",

      "answer": "The EU AI Act introduces stringent compliance requirements for AI technologies, which both Google and Meta must navigate. Google, as seen in its 2024 10-K filing, faces significant regulatory scrutiny due to its broad digital platform operations and reliance on AI for search and content moderation. The company is already investing heavily in proprietary technology to detect web spam and enforce content guidelines, yet still faces risks of litigation and penalties under evolving AI laws. Meta, on the other hand, is not only subject to similar regulatory pressures but also faces competitive risks from other AI developers and uncertainties around open-source AI distribution. The company notes in its 2024 10-K that third-party misuse of its AI could harm its reputation or lead to legal liability, adding another layer of complexity to its compliance strategy. Therefore, while both companies must adapt to the EU AI Act, Meta\u2019s exposure to both competitive and third-party usage risks may require a more diversified compliance and mitigation strategy compared to Google, which is more focused on internal AI governance and content control.",

While we inv est significantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relev ant results and to detect and prev ent low-quality content and inv alid  traffic,  we  hav e  been  unable  and  may  continue to be unable to detect and prev ent all such abuses or promote uniformly high-quality content. Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new av enues of abuse for bad actors.\n\nMany websites violate or attempt to v iolate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engine's assessment of their relev ance and utility would rank them. Such efforts hav e affected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms  and  lead  them  to  display  false,  misleading,  or  undesirable  content. Although  English-language  web  spam  in  our  search  results  has  been reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improv e their rankings. Although we continue to inv est in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prev ent web spam on our platforms, there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful, and our users may hav e negativ e experiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended, which may affect  our  users'  decisions  in  continuing  to  use  our  platforms.  We  also  face  other  challenges  from  low-quality  and  irrelev ant  content  websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improv e their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prev ent abuse from low-quality websites, but we may not always be successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including v iolations of our content guidelines inv olv ing incidents such as attempted election interference; activ ities that threaten the safety and/or well-being of our users, including minors, on- or off-line; and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation.\n\nIf we fail to either detect and prev ent an increase in problematic content or effectiv ely promote high-quality content, it could hurt our reputation for deliv ering relev ant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in monetary penalties and damages and div ert management's time and attention.\n\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\n\nOur products and serv ices depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant network capacity to  work  effectiv ely.  Currently,  this  access  is  prov ided  by  companies  that  hav e  significant  market  power  in  the  broadband  and  internet  access marketplace,  including  incumbent  telephone  companies,  cable  companies,  mobile  communications  companies,  and  gov ernment-owned  serv ice prov iders. Some of these prov iders hav e taken, or hav e stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, by charging increased fees  to  us  or  our  users  to  prov ide  our  offerings,  or  by  prov iding  our  competitors  preferential  access.  Some  jurisdictions  hav e  adopted  regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access prov iders; howev er, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and serv ices hav e been subject to gov ernment-initiated restrictions or blockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, adv ertisers, and/or content prov iders, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby negativ ely affecting our business.\n\n## Risks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\n\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to expand our business.\n\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state as well as foreign laws and regulations cov ering a wide v ariety of subjects, and our introduction of  new  businesses,  products,  serv ices,  and  technologies  will  likely  continue  to  subject  us  to  additional  laws  and  regulations.  In  recent  years, governments around the world hav e proposed and adopted a large number of new laws and regulations relev ant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data priv acy and security, competition, AI, and online content. T he costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future, including as a result of differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations.",

          "chunk_text": "## The  development  and  use  of  AI  present  risks  and  challenges  that may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe or our third-party vendors, clients or counterparties have in the past developed or incorporated, and may in the future develop or incorporate, AI  technology  in  certain  business  processes,  services  or  products.  The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

For ex ample, our AI-related efforts, particularly those related to generative AI, subject us to risks related to harmful or illegal content, accuracy, misinformation and deepfakes (including related to elections), bias, discrimination, tox icity, consumer protection, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and sanctions and export controls, among others. It is also uncertain how various laws related to online services, intermediary liability, and other issues will apply to content generated by AI. In addition, we are subject to the risks of new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, or other legal liability, ethical concerns, negative consumer perceptions as to automation and AI, activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nAs a result of the complexity and rapid development of AI, it is also the subject of evolving review by various governmental and regulatory agencies in jurisdictions around the world, which are applying, or are considering applying, platform moderation, intellectual property, cybersecurity, export controls, and data protection laws to AI and/or are considering general legal frameworks on AI (such as the recently passed EU AI Act). We may not always be able to anticipate how courts and regulators will apply existing laws to AI, predict how new legal frameworks will develop to address AI, or otherwise respond to these frameworks as they are still  rapidly evolving.  We may also have to expend resources to adapt to new legal frameworks, and adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks on AI are not consistent across jurisdictions.\n\nFurther, we face significant competition from other companies that are developing their own AI features and technologies. Other companies may develop AI features and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or are more cost-effective to develop and deploy. G iven the long history of development in the AI sector, other parties may have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our own AI features. Our AI initiatives also depend on our access to data to effectively train our models. Further, our ability to continue to develop and effectively deploy AI technologies is dependent on access to specific third-party equipment and other technical and physical infrastructure, such as processing hardware, network capacity, computing power, and related energy requirements, as to which we cannot control the availability or pricing, especially in a highly competitive environment.\n\nWe are also developing AI technology that we make available via open source, commercial, and non-commercial license agreements to third-parties that can use this technology for use in their own products and services. We may not have insight into, or control over, the practices of third parties who may utilize such AI technologies. As such, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not use such AI technologies for improper purposes, including through the dissemination of illegal,  inaccurate,  defamatory  or  harmful  content,  intellectual  property  infringement  or  misappropriation,  furthering  bias  or  discrimination,  cybersecurity  attacks including  spear  phishing  attacks,  data  privacy  violations,  other  activities  that  threaten  people's  safety  or  well-being  on-  or  offline,  or  to  develop  competing technologies.  While  we  may  mitigate  certain  risks  associated  with  the  improper  use  of  our AI  models  through  both  technical  measures  and  the  inclusion  of contractual restrictions on third-party use in any agreement between us and any third party, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be effective. Such improper use by any third party could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results or subject us to legal liability.\n\nIt is not possible to predict all of the risks related to the use of AI and changes in laws, rules, directives, and regulations or other regulatory developments regarding the use of AI, including restrictions around the collection and use of data, may adversely affect our ability to develop and use AI or subject us to legal liability.\n\n## We make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\n\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, our \"Y our Activity off-Meta Technologies\" tool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective ads to our users.

      "answer": "META announced on February 1, 2024, that it would pay a cash dividend of $0.50 per share on both Class A and Class B common stock, equivalent to $2.00 per share annually, marking its first-ever dividend. Class B shares, which are not publicly traded, convert on a one-for-one basis into Class A shares, which are listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker 'META'. In contrast, CMCSA also lists Class A Common Stock on the Nasdaq, but there is no mention of a similar dividend initiation or conversion mechanism for its shares. This highlights a key difference in capital structure and shareholder return strategy between the two companies.",

      "question": "How does the share repurchase activity of GOOGL in 2023, specifically involving Class A common stock, relate to the structural conversion mechanism between Class A and Class B common stock, and how does this contrast with META's treatment of Class B common stock in its dividend policy?",
      "answer": "GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023, with $36.3 billion remaining available under the repurchase authorization as of December 31, 2023. Since Class B shares automatically convert to Class A shares upon sale or transfer, any repurchase of Class A shares could indirectly impact the Class B shareholder base through conversion. In contrast, META treats both Class A and Class B common stock equally in its dividend policy, paying $0.50 per share quarterly, despite Class B shares not being publicly traded.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Class A Common Stock: GOOGL repurchased $62.2 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2023, with $36.3 billion remaining available under the repurchase program.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: Class B shares can be converted to Class A shares at the holder\u2019s option and automatically convert upon sale or transfer, linking the repurchase of Class A shares to potential reductions in Class B shares outstanding.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 META: META pays the same $0.50 per share quarterly dividend on both Class A and Class B common stock, even though Class B shares are not publicly traded and have different market liquidity."

      "answer": "Alphabet's Certificate of Incorporation includes specific safeguards that prevent unequal dividend treatment across Class A, B, and C stock by requiring board and stockholder approval for amendments affecting stock rights, and ensures equal liquidation and dividend rights across classes. In contrast, Comcast disclosed in its 2023 10-K that it had issued 9,444,375 Class B common shares in 2023 with no such shares outstanding in 2022, but did not specify similar safeguards or voting restrictions. This indicates that while Alphabet explicitly structures its Class B shares (which are economically equivalent to other classes) to prevent unequal treatment, Comcast's Class B shares appear to be a newly introduced or restructured class in 2023 without detailed disclosure of similar protective provisions, suggesting differing approaches to shareholder rights and equity classification.",

      "answer": "Comcast received $5.2 billion in proceeds from a term loan facility collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds from the Hulu sale, which was repaid in Q4 2023. Hulu paid ESPN fees for the right to air their networks on Hulu Live, linking to ESPN's content distribution strategy. ESPN+ grew to 26 million paid subscribers by September 2024, showing Disney's expanding direct-to-consumer sports platform that likely influenced Hulu's programming value and the timing of Comcast's exit.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairo s as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. Certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf are accounted for as advances and classified within other investments. Atairos may pledge our remaining unfunded capital commitment as security to lenders in connection with certain financing arrangements.  This has no effect on our funding commitments. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n\nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made cash capital contributions totaling $73 million, $145 million, and $52 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment, inclusive of advances classified within other investments, was $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.\n\n## Hulu and Collateralized Obligation\n\nIn  2019,  we  entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  with  The  Walt  Disney  Company  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries,  whereby  we  relinquished  our  board  seats  and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. Concurrent with these agreements, we also acquired additional ownership interest in Hulu previously held by AT&amp;T. Following these transactions, our interest was approximately 33% and we had the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of future equity capital calls. The agreements included put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we could require Disney to buy, and Disney could require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu. In the third quarter of 2023, we amended these agreements and agreed, among other things, that the put/call provisions regarding our interest could be exercised in November 2023 (in addition to subsequent periods) and that we would fund our share of prior equity capital calls if the put/call was ex ercised in November 2023.\n\nIn November 2023, we exercised our put right requiring Disney to purchase our interest in Hulu. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Disney paid us $8.6 billion, representing $9.2 billion for our share of Hulu's minimum equity value, less $557 million for our share of prior capital calls. Additional proceeds for any ex cess of the fair value of our interest over the $9.2 billion minimum equity value will be due following final determination of Hulu's fair value pursuant to a third-party appraisal process. In connection with the transaction, Disney also agreed to share with us 50% of the future tax benefits resulting from the purchase of our interest in Hulu. Because we continue to hold our interest in Hulu, the $9.2 billion payment from Disney is treated as an advance on the sale of our interest, which will be recognized following the finalization of the appraisal process. The receipt of the minimum proceeds resulted in a tax gain in 2023. The recorded value of our investment in Hulu of $883 million and $863 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, continues to reflect our historical cost in applying the equity method, and therefore, is less than its fair value.\n\nIn 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility, which was fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. The term loan was due at the earlier of March 2024 or upon receipt of the proceeds under the put/call provisions and was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe present the advance on the sale of our  investment  and  the  term  loan  separately  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  in  the  captions  'advance  on  sale  of investment' and 'collateralized obligation,' respectively.\n\n## Marketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify investments with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as marketable equity securities and the carrying values are primarily presented in other current assets. The changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities between measurement dates are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The fair values of our marketable equity securities are based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market prices.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "At CMCSA, holders of Class A common stock collectively hold 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while the Class B common stock, all beneficially owned by Mr. Brian L. Roberts, holds 33 1/3% of the voting power, with each Class B share carrying 15 votes. In contrast, at GOOGL, Class A common stock carries 1 vote per share, while Class B common stock carries 10 votes per share, though the evidence does not specify ownership concentration for Class B shares at GOOGL. Additionally, GOOGL repurchased $62.0 billion of Class A and Class C shares in 2024, while CMCSA\u2019s repurchase table shows activity related to its Class A common stock, though specific dollar amounts for repurchases are not provided in the evidence. This indicates that both companies maintain multi-tiered voting structures, but with differing levels of voting concentration and repurchase transparency.",

      "question": "How do Alphabet's selective repurchases of Class A and Class C shares, while retaining high-vote Class B shares, compare to Meta's investor ownership structure in terms of maintaining long-term control and shareholder influence?",
      "answer": "Alphabet has repurchased $62.0 billion worth of Class A and Class C shares in 2024, preserving Class B shares that carry 10 votes per share, thereby maintaining founder control while returning capital to public shareholders. In contrast, Meta reports 2,189,898,148 shares of Class A common stock outstanding as of January 24, 2025, with no mention of a dual-class structure that would similarly concentrate voting power. This indicates that Alphabet employs a more structured approach to capital return that safeguards long-term strategic control, whereas Meta's ownership appears more diffused among shareholders.",

      "question": "How does the voting power distribution tied to Class A and Class B common stock at CMCSA compare to META's dual-class structure in terms of shareholder control concentration as of December 31, 2023?",
      "answer": "CMCSA's Class A common stockholders hold 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while Class B common stockholders hold 33 1/3%, with Mr. Brian L. Roberts owning all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. In contrast, META's Class B common stock is not publicly traded and as of December 31, 2023, there were only 23 stockholders of record of Class B common stock, indicating a similarly concentrated control structure but with different voting power distribution.",

At CMCSA, Class B common stock has 15 votes per share and represents 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, a percentage that is non-dilutable under the company's articles of incorporation.

      "question": "How does the difference in voting rights structure between NFLX common stock and GOOGL Class B common stock impact shareholder influence, given that GOOGL Class B shares carry 10 votes per share while NFLX shares carry only one vote per share?",
      "answer": "NFLX common stock provides one vote per share to all shareholders, granting equal influence per share. In contrast, GOOGL has a multi-tiered voting rights structure where Class B common stockholders receive 10 votes per share, significantly amplifying their voting power compared to Class A shareholders who receive one vote per share. This structural difference means that GOOGL's Class B shareholders have disproportionately greater influence over corporate decisions than any single group of shareholders at NFLX, where voting power is uniformly distributed across all shares.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NFLX \u2192 Voting Rights: NFLX common stock provides one vote per share to all shareholders, ensuring equal voting influence across all stockholders.",
        "Hop 2: Voting Rights \u2192 Class B Common Stock: GOOGL's Class B common stock is explicitly associated with enhanced voting rights, granting 10 votes per share, compared to one vote for Class A shares.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 GOOGL: GOOGL maintains a multi-tiered stock structure that includes Class B common stock, which can be converted to Class A shares either voluntarily or upon sale, but retains concentrated voting power while outstanding."

      "question": "How does the voting power distribution in CMCSA's stock structure, particularly through Class B common stock ownership, compare to GOOGL's Class A common stock distribution in terms of shareholder control concentration?",
      "answer": "CMCSA's Class B common stock, with only 3 record holders, provides 33 1/3% of the combined voting power with each share having 15 votes, and is entirely owned by Brian L. Roberts, creating a concentrated control point. In contrast, GOOGL's Class A common stock, which had 300,754,904 shares outstanding as of January 25, 2022, is generally associated with non-affiliate shareholders and does not carry the same level of concentrated voting control, as Class B shares (44,576,938 outstanding) are more likely to be held by insiders with greater voting influence. This suggests that CMCSA exhibits a more centralized control structure through its Class B shares compared to GOOGL's broader Class A share distribution.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Class B Common Stock: CMCSA discloses that only 3 record holders exist for its Class B common stock, with Mr. Brian L. Roberts owning all outstanding shares, giving him significant voting power.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: The Class B common stock has 15 votes per share and represents 33 1/3% of the combined voting power, while Class A common stock collectively holds 66 2/3% of the voting power, showing a structured but imbalanced governance model.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 GOOGL: GOOGL reports 300,754,904 shares of Class A common stock outstanding as of January 25, 2022, indicating a much broader distribution and less concentrated ownership compared to CMCSA's Class A/Class B structure."

      "question": "How does the voting power distribution tied to Class A and Class B common stock at Comcast (CMCSA) compare to the shareholder structure disclosed by Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), particularly in terms of control concentration and stock class dynamics?",
      "answer": "At Comcast (CMCSA), holders of Class A common stock collectively hold 66 2/3% of the combined voting power, while the Class B common stock, all beneficially owned by Brian L. Roberts, holds 33 1/3% of the voting power, with each Class B share carrying 15 votes. This reflects a concentrated control structure where Class B shares maintain a non-dilutable voting stake. Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), on the other hand, discloses that it has both Class A and Class B common stock outstanding, with 2,189,898,148 shares of Class A and 343,761,117 shares of Class B stock as of January 24, 2025. While the specific voting rights of each class are not detailed in the provided evidence, the significant number of Class A shares relative to Class B suggests a more dispersed ownership model compared to CMCSA\u2019s dual-class framework. The structural contrast highlights different approaches to corporate governance and shareholder control between the two companies.",

        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 CMCSA: CMCSA specifically discloses that Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock, which gives him outsized voting control despite owning a minority of total shares."

      "question": "How does the voting power distribution tied to Class A and Class B common stock at META compare to GOOGL's structure, given the dynamic relationship between share class voting rights and outstanding share counts?",
      "answer": "At META, Class A and Class B common stock collectively determine voting power, with Class A shares held by the public and Class B shares (each carrying 15 votes) held by insiders, resulting in a weighted voting structure. Similarly, at GOOGL, Class B common stockholders (typically insiders) hold 10 votes per share, while Class A shares (publicly traded) have 1 vote each. The dynamic voting power percentage of each class depends on the outstanding shares, as seen in META's 66 2/3% for Class A and 33 1/3% for Class B, mirroring GOOGL\u2019s intent to maintain insider control through higher-vote share classes despite repurchasing Class A and Class C shares totaling $62.0 billion in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: META \u2192 Class A Common Stock: META discloses that Class A common stock is publicly traded and carries one vote per share, with 2,189,898,148 shares outstanding as of January 2025, contributing to 66 2/3% of the total voting power.",
        "Hop 2: Class A Common Stock \u2192 Class B Common Stock: The voting power is dynamically determined by the ratio of outstanding Class A and Class B shares, with each Class B share carrying 15 votes and representing 33 1/3% of the total voting power, which is non-dilutable.",
        "Hop 3: Class B Common Stock \u2190 GOOGL: GOOGL also maintains a dual-class structure where Class B shares carry 10 votes per share, and Class A shares have one vote each, with $62.0 billion in share repurchases in 2024 that could shift the relative voting balance."

      "answer": "At META, Peggy Alford's plan allows for the sale of up to $1.2 million worth of shares and will terminate on November 15, 2025, while Christopher K. Cox's plan allows for the sale of 60,000 shares and terminates on February 20, 2026. In contrast, Robert A. Iger at DIS adopted a plan to sell up to 372,412 shares tied to stock options expiring on December 18, 2024, with the plan set to terminate on December 17, 2024. Both companies utilize Rule 10b5-1(c) to structure these transactions, but the scale, timing, and option expiration linkage differ significantly between the two firms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: META \u2192 Rule 10b5-1(c): META has multiple directors and officers with trading plans under Rule 10b5-1(c), including specific details about Peggy Alford's $1.2 million share sale plan and Christopher K. Cox's 60,000 share plan with defined termination dates.",
        "Hop 2: Rule 10b5-1(c) \u2192 Trading Plan: Rule 10b5-1(c) serves as the regulatory framework under which both META and DIS structure their insider trading plans, providing a consistent legal basis for comparing these transactions.",
        "Hop 3: Trading Plan \u2190 DIS: DIS has a notable trading plan involving CEO Robert A. Iger, tied specifically to the expiration of stock options on December 18, 2024, with a sale plan covering up to 372,412 shares and a termination date just before the option expiration."

Controls and Procedures\n\n## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Ex change Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the  Securities  and  Ex change  Commission,  and  that  such  information  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  management,  including  our  CEO  and  CFO,  as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. G AAP. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst &amp; Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Limitations on E ffectiv eness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n\n## Item 9B. Other Information\n\n## Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\n\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the officers and directors listed below adopted, modified, or terminated trading plans intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nOn November 27, 2024, Peggy Alford,  a member of our board of directors, entered into a trading plan that provides for the sale of an aggregate of up to $1.2 million worth of shares of our Class A common stock. The plan will terminate on November 15, 2025, subject to early termination for certain specified events set forth in the plan.\n\nOn November 27, 2024, Christopher K. Cox, our Chief Product Officer, entered into a trading plan that provides for the sale of an aggregate of up to 60,000 shares of our Class A common stock. The plan will terminate on February 20, 2026, subject to early termination for certain specified events set forth in the plan.",
