Costco explicitly lists Taiwan as one of the international markets where it operates membership warehouses, indicating a direct operational presence.

Effective for fiscal 2022, stock-based compensation was allocated to the segments in this reporting.

Higher net pricing, which included the carryov er impact of pricing actions taken in 2023 as well as the effects of input cost-driv en pricing actions taken during 2024, was reflected across  all  regions.  T he  increase  in  input  costs  was  driv en  by  higher  raw  material  costs,  partially  offset  by  lower  manufacturing  costs  driv en  by productiv ity. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher cocoa, sugar, nuts and other ingredient costs, as well as unfav orable year-ov er-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower energy, edible oils, grains, dairy and packaging costs.  Ov erall, unfav orable v olume/mix was due to v olume declines partially offset by fav orable product mix. Unfav orable v olume/mix was experienced in all regions.\n\nT otal selling, general and administrativ e expenses decreased $563 million from 2023, which was net of benefits from a number of factors noted in the table abov e, including in part, fav orable contingent consideration adjustments related to the Clif Bar acquisition and lower acquisition integration costs, lapping prior-year div estiture-related costs, the elimination of costs from the dev eloped market gum business div ested in 2023, lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position, a fav orable currency translation impact related to expenses and lapping prior-year impact from the European Commission legal matter, marginally offset by costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program and higher implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow  program.  Excluding  these  factors,  selling,  general  and  administrativ e  expenses  increased  $215  million  from  2023.  T he  increase  was  driv en primarily  by  higher  adv ertising  and  consumer  promotion  costs  and  higher  ov erhead  costs  in  part  due  to  increased  inv estments  in  route  to  market capabilities.\n\nUnfavorable currency-related items, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, decreased operating income by $191 million primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relativ e to most currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Russian ruble, Brazilian real, Egyptian pound, T urkish lira, Chinese yuan and Nigerian naira, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relativ e to the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound sterling and Polish zloty.\n\nOperating income margin increased from 15.3% in 2023 to 17.4% in 2024. The increase in operating income margin was driv en primarily by fav orable year-ov er-year  change  in  acquisition  integration  costs  and  contingent  consideration  adjustments,  fav orable  year-ov er-year  change  in  mark-to-market gains/(losses) from commodity and currency hedging activ ities, higher Adjusted Operating Income margin, lower div estiture-related costs, lapping prioryear impact from the European Commission legal matter and lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position, partially offset by higher intangible asset impairment charges, lapping the prior-year gain and the impact from the dev eloped market gum business div ested in 2023 and costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program.

Known or expected pricing or rev enue adjustments, such as trade discounts, rebates or returns, are estimated at the time of sale. We base these estimates of expected amounts principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. Estimates that affect rev enue, such as trade incentiv es and product returns, are monitored and adjusted each period until the incentiv es or product returns are realized.\n\nKey  sales  terms,  such  as  pricing  and  quantities  ordered,  are  established  on  a  frequent  basis  such  that  most  customer  arrangements  and  related incentiv es  hav e  a  one  year  or  shorter  duration. As  such,  we  do  not  capitalize  contract  inception  costs  and  we  capitalize  product  fulfillment  costs. Deferred rev enues are not material and primarily include customer adv ance payments typically collected a few days before product deliv ery, at which time deferred rev enues are reclassified and recorded as net rev enues. We generally do not receiv e non-cash consideration for the sale of goods nor do we grant payment financing terms greater than one year.\n\n## Marketing, Advertising and Research and Development\n\nWe promote our products with marketing and advertising programs.  These programs include, but are not limited to, cooperativ e adv ertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. For interim reporting purposes, adv ertising, consumer promotion and marketing research expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of v olume, based on estimated sales v olume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheets and all marketing and adv ertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred. Adv ertising expense was $2,112 million in 2024, $2,057 million in 2023 and $1,670 million in 2022. We expense product research and dev elopment costs as incurred. Research and development expense was $400 million in 2024, $380 million in 2023 and $346 million in 2022. We record marketing and adv ertising as well as research and dev elopment expenses within selling, general and administrativ e expenses.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain a share-based compensation plan, which authorizes the granting of v arious  equity-based  incentiv es,  including  stock  options  (including stock appreciation rights), deferred stock units (DSUs) and performance share units (PSUs). Stock compensation expense is amortized to expense ov er the v esting period, generally three years.\n\nStock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our Common Stock on the grant date. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in three annual installments beginning a year from the grant date and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes Model to measure the fair v alue of stock options granted to employees. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the  options  are  expected  to  be  outstanding  and  is  based  on  historical  trends.  Expected  stock  price  v olatility  is  based  on  the  implied  and  historical volatility of the Company's stock. T he expected div idend yield is based on the Company's most recent annual div idend rate. T he risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curv e in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life.\n\nDSUs are typically granted to selected management employees on an annual basis and v est ov er three years. Div idend equiv alents are paid during the vesting period for DSUs granted prior to February 27, 2024. For DSUs granted on or after February 27, 2024, div idend equiv alents accumulated ov er the vesting period are paid after v esting. T he fair v alue of our DSUs and other stock-based awards is measured at the market price of our Common Stock on the grant date.\n\nPSUs vest based on varying performance, market and serv ice conditions. Div idend equiv alents accumulated ov er the v esting period are paid after v esting. The grant date fair v alue of PSUs is determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation model for the market-based component and the market price of our Common  Stock  on  the  grant  date  for  performance-based  components.  The  final  award  may  equal 0-200  percent  of  the  target  grant,  based  on  the achiev ement of the performance and market-based components .\n\nForfeitures are estimated on the grant date for all of our stock-based compensation awards.\n\n## Employee Benefit Plans\n\nWe provide a range of benefits to our current and retired employees including pension benefits, defined contribution plan benefits, postretirement health care  benefits  and  postemployment  primarily  sev erance-related  benefits  depending  upon  local  statutory  requirements,  employee  tenure  and  serv ice requirements as well as other factors. The cost for these plans is recognized in earnings primarily ov er the working life of the cov ered employee.",

From July 22, 2021 through March 31, 2022, PMI repurchased 10.5 million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $1.0 billion. During the first three months of 2022, PMI repurchased 2.0 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $199 million. On May 11, 2022, we announced the suspension of the three-year share repurchase program following the recommended public offer to acquire the outstanding shares of Swedish Match from its shareholders. For further details, see Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures. Prior to the suspension of the program, PMI made no share repurchases during the second quarter of 2022. The three-year share repurchase program expired on July 21, 2024.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, 27,288,770 shares of common stock were reserved for stock awards under PMI's stock plans, and 250 million shares of preferred stock, without par value, were authorized but unissued. PMI currently has no plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.\n\n## Note 10.\n\n## Stock Plans:\n\nIn May 2022, PMI's shareholders approved the Philip Morris International Inc. 2022 Performance Incentive Plan (the '2022 Plan'). Under the 2022 Plan, PMI may grant to eligible employees restricted shares and restricted share units, performance-based cash incentive awards and performance-based equity awards. Up  to 25 million shares of PMI's common stock may be issued under the 2022 Plan. At December 31, 2024, shares available for grant under the 2022 Plan were 19,189,876.\n\nIn May 2017, PMI's shareholders approved the Philip Morris International Inc. 2017 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the '2017 Non-Employee Directors Plan'). A non-employee director is defined as a member of the PMI Board of Directors who is not a full-time employee of PMI or of any corporation in which PMI owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing at least 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote in the election of directors in such corporation. Up to 1 million shares of PMI common stock may be awarded under the 2017 Non-Employee Directors Plan. At December 31, 2024, shares available for grant under the plan were 855,920.\n\n## Restricted share unit (RSU) awards\n\nPMI may grant RSU awards to eligible employees; recipients may not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber such awards. Such awards are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. RSU awards generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. RSU awards do not carry voting rights, although they do earn dividend equivalents.",

      "answer": "COST accounts for non-lease components and the lease components to which they relate as a single lease component for all asset classes. MDLZ similarly combines non-lease components (e.g., product costs, common-area maintenance) with lease components and accounts for them together. PEP also combines lease and non-lease components, specifically citing that for real estate leases, they account for lease components together with non-lease components such as common-area maintenance. While all three companies follow a similar principle of integrating non-lease components into lease accounting, the specific examples and presentation differ, with COST and PEP emphasizing integration across all asset classes and real estate, respectively, while MDLZ provides more detail on the types of non-lease elements included. This reveals a consistent but nuanced application of lease accounting standards across the sector.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nSome leases include free-rent periods and step-rent provisions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nThe Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. Non-lease components and the lease components to which they relate are accounted for together as a single lease component for all asset classes. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. The lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. As the rate implicit  in  the  Company's  leases  is  not  easily  determinable,  the  present  value  of  the  sum  of  the  lease  payments  is calculated using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. Impairment of ROU assets is evaluated in a similar manner as described in Property and Equipment, net above.\n\nThe Company's asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that must be removed at the end of a lease. These obligations are generally recorded as a discounted liability, with an offsetting asset at the inception  of  the  lease  term,  based  upon  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  costs  to  remove  the  improvements.  These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same  depreciation method  as  the leasehold improvement  assets  and  are  included with buildings  and improvements.  Estimated  ARO  liabilities  associated  with  these  leases  are  included  in  other  liabilities  in  the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization.  The  Company  reviews  goodwill  annually  in  the  fourth  quarter  for  impairment  or  when  circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income approach estimates fair  value  based  on  expected  discounted  future  cash  flows,  while  the  market  approach  uses  comparable  public companies and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\n\nGoodwill  is  included  in  other  long-term  assets  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  The  following  table  summarizes goodwill by reportable segment:\n\n",

ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the lease liability, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received and initial direct costs incurred. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. The non-recurring fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 as no fair value inputs are observable. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our countryspecific incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term using information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Many of our leases contain non-lease components (e.g. product costs, common-area or other maintenance costs) that relate to the lease components of the agreement. Nonlease components and the lease components to which they relate are accounted for as a single lease component.\n\nAmortization of ROU lease assets is calculated on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the expense recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the leased item. Interest expense is recorded over the lease term and is recorded in interest expense (based on a front-loaded interest expense pattern) for finance leases and is recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses (on a straight-line basis) for operating leases. All operating lease cash payments and interest on finance leases are recorded within cash flows from operating activities and all finance lease principal payments are recorded within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Software Costs:\n\nWe capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed seven years.\n\n## Goodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangible Assets:\n\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on July 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit's fair value using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. In 2021, we performed a quantitative annual test. For our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a marketbased, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.4% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations, and for our Latin America and AMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.4%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, industry and economic conditions, and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\n\nAnnually we assess indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these intangible assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We determine estimated fair value using estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, we consider the asset impaired and reduce its carrying value to the estimated fair value. We amortize definite-life intangible assets over their estimated useful lives and evaluate them for impairment as we do other long-lived assets.",

      "answer": "PepsiCo (PEP) highlights that nationalization of assets or those of business partners is a risk in developing and emerging markets where they operate, particularly in regions with geopolitical tensions or unstable legal systems. Philip Morris International (PM) specifically notes that nationalization of its Russian assets, including trademarks and cash reserves, is a material risk due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and retaliatory actions by the Russian government. Walmart (WMT) identifies nationalization as a risk in its international operations, particularly in countries like India and Mexico, where foreign ownership restrictions and regulatory changes could impact its business. When combined, these disclosures show that while all three companies face nationalization risks, the nature and geographic focus of these risks differ based on their industry-specific operations and regional footprints.",

These uncertain or unfavorable econom ic conditions have resulted in and could continue to result in recessions or econom ic slowdowns; volatile commodity  markets;  labor  shortages;  highly  inflationary  econom ies,  devaluation,  fluctuation  or  dem onetization  of  currency;  contraction  in  the availability of credit; austerity or stim ulus m easures; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are sold; or a decrease in the fair value of pension or post-retirem ent assets that could increase future em ployee benefit costs and/or funding requirem ents of our pension or post-retirem ent plans. Under difficult econom ic conditions, consum ers m ay seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or shifting toward lower-priced products offered by other com panies, including private-label brands, which has im pacted and could continue to im pact consum er dem and for our products.

If our management fails to account for other relevant information or substitute the key business metrics they review as our business changes or if the assumptions or estimates underlying the metrics are inaccurate, their ability to accurately formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions may be compromised and our business, financial results and future growth prospects may be adversely impacted.\n\nRisks Related to the Impact of the War in Ukraine on our Business\n\n## Our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position may be adversely impacted by the continuation and consequences of the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn  2024,  Russia  accounted  for  around  9%  of  our  total  cigarette  and  heated  tobacco  unit  shipment  volume,  and  around  6%  of  our  total  net  revenues.  Ukraine accounted for around 2% of our total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume, and around 1% of our total net revenues. Historically, we also produced finished goods in Ukraine for export and manufactured products in Russia. In 2022, as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we suspended planned investments and scaled down our manufacturing operations in Russia.\n\nThe full implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine for our operations in those countries are impossible to predict at this time. The likelihood of retaliatory action by the  Russian  government  against  companies,  including  PMI,  as  a  result  of  actions  and  statements  made  in  response  to  the  Russian  invasion  or  otherwise, including the possibility of legal action against us or our employees; the deprivation of rights in, or access to, our Russian or Russia-related assets; or nationalization of foreign businesses or assets (including cash reserves held in Russia and intangible assets such as trademarks), is impossible to predict. We are continuously assessing the evolving situation in Russia, including regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. The deprivation of rights in, or access to, our Russian or Russia-related assets could also result in a material impairment and could cause the deconsolidation of our Russian business. In Ukraine, there is no way to know when and to what extent we will be able to fully normalize our operations or to what extent our workforce, facilities, inventory, and other assets will remain intact. These developments have and will continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in further impairment charges.\n\nThe conflict also continues to elevate the likelihood of supply chain disruptions, both in the region and globally, and may inhibit our ability to timely source materials and services needed to make and sell our products. For example, historically we sourced certain finished goods, production materials and components from both Russia and Ukraine, including printed materials and filters, and the invasion has, and may continue to, disrupt the availability of and impact our supply chain for these materials. These disruptions, to the extent we are unable to find alternative sources or otherwise address these supply constraints, may impact the availability and cost of our products in other markets, which would adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in impairment charges. Furthermore, the imposition of various restrictions on transactions with parties from certain jurisdictions, the ban on exports of various products, and  other  economic  and  financial  restrictions  may  adversely  affect  certain  third  parties  with  which  we  do  business  in  Russia,  such  as  customers,  suppliers, intermediaries, service providers and banks.\n\nThe broader consequences of the invasion are also impossible to predict, but could include reputational consequences, further sanctions, financial or currency restrictions,  punitive  tax   law  changes,  embargoes,  regional  instability,  and  geopolitical  shifts  as  well  as  adverse  effects  on  macroeconomic  conditions,  security conditions, currency exchange rates, and financial markets. G iven the nature of our business and global operations, such geo-political instability and uncertainty could increase the costs of our materials and operations; reduce demand for our products; have a negative impact on our supply chains, manufacturing capabilities, or  distribution  capabilities;  increase  our  ex posure  to  currency  fluctuations;  constrain  our  liquidity  or  our  ability  to  access  capital  markets;  create  staffing  or operations difficulties; or subject us to increased cyber-attacks. While we will continue to monitor this fluid situation and develop contingency plans as necessary to address any disruptions to our business operations as they develop, the extent of the conflict's effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted.\n\nThe conflict may also heighten many other risks disclosed in this Form 10-K, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Such risks could affect, without limitation, the achievement of our strategic priorities, including achievement of our smoke-free business growth targets; the availability of third-party manufacturing resources; the availability of attractive acquisition and strategic business opportunities and our ability to fully realize the benefits of these transactions; our ability to attract, motivate, and retain the best global talent; and our loss of revenue from counterfeiting and similar illicit activities.",

Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.\n\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores, clubs and eCommerce platforms around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our results of operations.\n\n## Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks\n\nOur international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.\n\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we operate retail and eCommerce businesses in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.\n\nDuring fiscal 2025, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions; legal and regulatory constraints, such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as in India; restrictive governmental actions, such as trade protection measures or nationalization; antitrust and competition law regulatory matters, such as those underway in Canada, Mexico and India (relating to our Flipkart subsidiary); local product safety and environmental laws; tax regulations; local labor laws; anti-money laundering laws and regulations; trade policies; foreign ex change or currency regulations; laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection; and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.\n\nChanging our operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade or newly imposed sanctions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and we may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. In addition, tensions between nation-state governments and conflicts of laws may lead to challenges for our operations. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response, or consumer boycotts in certain regions, could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could also adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they recur, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also ex ist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, geopolitical tensions or events, laws and regulations.\n\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or U.S. sanctions laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries. Our global policies designed to regulate such business practices and our global compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations may not be adequate to prevent the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are appropriately regulated by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could subject us to fines and penalties and adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\n\nAs we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our ov erall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adv erse effects that the v olatility of these markets may hav e on our operating results.\n\nWe principally utilize deriv ativ e instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from v olatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our deriv ativ e activ ity and the types of deriv ativ e instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 10, Financial Instruments .\n\nMany of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create v olatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the  U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated  reporting  generally  results  in  a  cumulativ e  translation  adjustment  to  other  comprehensiv e  income  within  equity. A  stronger  U.S.  dollar relativ e to other functional currencies adv ersely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate v olatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Operations by Operating Segment under Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results for  currency  exchange  effects  on  our  financial  results.  T hroughout  our  discussion  and  analysis  of  results,  we  isolate  currency  impacts  and supplementally prov ide net rev enues, operating income and diluted earnings per share on a constant currency basis. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, recent currency dev aluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting .\n\nWe also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather  conditions,  gov ernment  policy  and  regulation  and  the  macroeconomic  env ironment.  Refer  to Recent  Developments  and  Significant  Items Affecting Comparability and Financial Outlook above for updates on recent supply chain, labor and other disruptions that are increasing operating costs and  impacting  our  results.  T o  manage  input  cost  v olatility  and  inflation,  we  enter  into  forward  purchase  agreements  and  other  deriv ativ e  financial instruments. We also pursue productiv ity and cost sav ing measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings.\n\nWe regularly ev aluate our v ariable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures  include  mov ements  in  U.S.  T reasury  rates,  corporate  credit  spreads,  commercial  paper  rates  as  well  as  limited  debt  tied  to  Secured Overnight  Financing  Rates  ('SOFR').  We  periodically  use  interest  rate  swaps  and  forward  interest  rate  contracts  to  achiev e  a  desired  proportion  of variable  v ersus  fixed-rate  debt  based  on  current  and  projected  market  conditions.  For  more  information  on  our  debt  activ ity,  see  Note  9, Debt  and Borrowing Arrangements .\n\nSee Note 10, Financial Instruments , for more information on our deriv ativ e activ ity.\n\n## Value at Risk\n\nWe use a value at risk ('VAR') computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair v alue of our interest rate-sensitiv e financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitiv e deriv ativ e financial instruments. T he VAR analysis was done separately as of each quarter end for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios using historical market mov ements. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receiv ables, and net inv estments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the abov e-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.",

          "chunk_text": "## ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES\n\nGlobal E conomic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are G reater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and G ermany and collectively comprised approximately 20% of our net sales in fiscal 2024. As a result, we are exposed to global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions and government policies. We are exposed to market risks from operating in challenging environments due to economic, political and social instabilities, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, currency controls, foreign ex change and interest rate changes. These risks can negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. For example, we are exposed to risks due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Our Russia business accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales, net earnings and net assets as of June 30, 2024.\n\nForeign Exchange. We have significant exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, both due to translation and transaction exposures. Translation exposures arise from measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Transaction exposures involve impacts from 1) input costs that are denominated in currencies other than the local reporting currency and 2) revaluation of working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We have experienced significant foreign exchange impacts in the past due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the US dollar, which  have  negatively  impacted  net  sales,  net  earnings  and  cash  flows.  In  response  to  the  devaluation  of  foreign  currencies  (including  those  deemed  highly inflationary), any lags or inability (due to government restrictions) to implement price increases or the negative impacts of such actions on product consumption may lead to a decline in our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nCommodities and  Supply  Chain. Our costs are subject to fluctuations due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, inflationary impacts and productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. V olatility in the market price of commodities and input materials directly affects our costs. Disruptions in manufacturing, supply and distribution  operations  can  lead  to  increased  costs.  Legal  or  regulatory  requirements  and  sustainability  initiatives  may  result  in  increased  costs.  We  strive  to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response  to  certain  inflationary  or  cost  increases  may  also  offset  portions  of  the  cost  impacts;  however,  such  price  increases  may  negatively  impact  product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nGovernment Policies. We are exposed to changes in U.S. and foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies that can have a negative impact on net sales, net earnings and cash flows. These include tax policy changes (both U.S. and foreign), including those resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy'. G overnment controls such as currency exchanges, pricing and import authorizations as well as government policies related to environmental and climate change matters and changes to international trade agreements can also impact our financial performance.\n\nFor additional information on risk factors that could impact our business results, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&amp;A), operating margin, other non-operating items, income taxes and net earnings. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending, retail executions (both in-store and online) and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as our pricing actions (which can also impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign exchange impacts on sales outside the U.S.\n\nFor most of our categories, our cost of products sold and SG &amp;A are variable in nature to some extent. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in North America are generally higher than the Company average for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for ex ample, product or package improvements) and, to a lesser extent, scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SG&amp;A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems' infrastructures to support business growth. The main drivers of changes in  SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments (for example, increased  advertising),  inflation,  foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive experienced 7.0% organic sales growth in Africa/Eurasia in 2021, driven in part by performance in South Africa, indicating a growing consumer base for personal care products. PepsiCo made contributions to socioeconomic programs in South Africa as part of its acquisition and integration activities, suggesting a focus on corporate social responsibility and market development. Walmart operates 414 stores (324 retail and 90 wholesale) in Africa, including South Africa, reflecting a significant physical retail presence aimed at serving local consumers and small businesses. Together, these engagements highlight South Africa's role as a strategic market for multinational consumer staples companies, with opportunities in retail infrastructure, product sales, and community investment.",

Organic sales in Africa/Eurasia increased 7.0% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by Turkiye, Nigeria and South Africa.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was primarily due to an increase in Oral Care organic sales.

This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to a decrease in Gross profit (170 bps), partially offset by a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses (60 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales.

          "chunk_text": "## Promotional and Marketing Programs\n\nIn addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities, we may provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds to our bottlers. In most cases, we do this on a discretionary basis under the terms of commitment letters or agreements, even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottler's agreements between our Company and the bottlers. Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce new products, packages and equipment to assist the bottlers. Likewise, in many instances, we provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to fountain and bottle/can retailers, typically pursuant to marketing agreements.\n\n## Investments in Bottling Operations\n\nMost of our branded beverage products are prepared, packaged, distributed and sold by independent bottling partners. However, from time to time we acquire or take control of a bottling operation, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning a bottling operation enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler's sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler's business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. In line with our long-term bottling strategy, we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation, typically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-Cola system efficiency. When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an equity method investment, our Company continues to participate in the bottler's results of operations through our share of the equity method investee's earnings or losses.\n\nIn addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in certain bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca-Cola system's production, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net operating revenues and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generate increased sales for our Company's concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler's operating and financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nSales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters historically accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. These include companies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; dilutables (including syrups and powders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-based beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and relaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. The Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States. In the United States, the Company has established a wholly owned, indirect, firewalled subsidiary, which uses third-party manufacturers and distributors to produce and sell alcohol products in certain regions of the United States and also authorizes alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage bases. Competitive products include all alcohol ready-to-drink beverages containing various alcohol bases. In many of the countries in which we do business, PepsiCo, Inc. is a primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone S.A., Suntory Beverage &amp; Food Limited, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Kirin Holdings, Heineken N.V., Diageo plc and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, increasingly, against smaller companies that are developing microbrands and selling them directly to consumers through e-commerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete against retailers that have developed their own store or private-label beverage brands.\n\nCompetitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs,     in-store displays and point-of-sale marketing, digital marketing, product and ingredient innovation, availability, increased efficiency in production techniques, the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing equipment, contracting with marketing assets (theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc.), and brand and trademark development and protection.",

We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional  wholesalers  and  retailers,  including  supermarkets,  supercenters,  internet  retailers,  gasoline  stations,  hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors in the U.S. We also compete with other warehouse clubs, including Walmart's Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club. Many of the major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple competing clubs.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale trademarks and our private-label brand, Kirkland Signature. We believe that Kirkland Signature products  are  high  quality,  offered  at  prices  that  are  generally  lower  than  national  brands,  and  help  lower  costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private-label items.\n\nWe rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.\n\n## Available Information\n\nOur U.S. website is www.costco.com.

Our  products  are  sold  in  approximately  180  countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, ecommerce  (including  social  commerce)  channels,  grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors,  wholesalers,  specialty  beauty  stores  (including airport  duty-free  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies, electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell direct  to  consumers.  We  have  on-the-ground  operations  in approximately 70 countries.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its  controlled  subsidiaries.  Intercompany  transactions  are eliminated.\n\nBecause  of  a  lack  of  control  over  Venezuelan  subsidiaries caused by a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not consolidated  for  any  year  presented.  We  account  for  those subsidiaries at cost, less impairments, plus or minus observable price changes.\n\nBeginning in fiscal year 2022, the Company began to present increases and reductions in short-term debt with maturities of more  than  three  months  separately  within  the  Consolidated Statements  of  Cash  Flows.  The  presentation  for  the  twelve months  ended  June  30,  2021,  and  June  30,  2020,  have  been revised  to  align  with  the  current  period  presentation.  This change  had  no  impact  on  total  financing  activities,  and  we have concluded the change is not material.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of  America  (U.S.  GAAP)  requires  management  to  make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge  of  current  events  and  actions  the  Company  may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among  other  items,  consumer  and  trade  promotion  accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, postretirement benefits, stock options,  valuation  of  acquired  intangible  assets,  useful  lives for  depreciation  and  amortization  of  long-lived  assets,  future cash  flows  associated  with  impairment  testing  for  goodwill, indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  and  other  long-lived  assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax positions  and  contingencies.  Actual  results  may  ultimately differ from estimates, although management does not generally believe such differences would materially affect the financial statements in any individual year. However, regarding ongoing  impairment  testing  of  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus  those  anticipated  at  the  time  of  the  initial  valuations, could  result  in  impairment  charges  that  materially  affect  the financial statements in a given year.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product  to  customers.  Those  sales  predominantly  contain  a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single  point  in  time  when  ownership,  risks  and  rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt  by  the  customer.  A  provision  for  payment  discounts and  product  return  allowances  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of sales  in  the  same  period  the  revenue  is  recognized.  The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect  on  behalf  of  governmental  authorities.  The  revenue includes  shipping  and  handling  costs,  which  generally  are included in the list price to the customer.\n\nTrade  promotions,  consisting  primarily  of  customer  pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending,  which  is  recognized  as  incurred  at  the  time  of  the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are  included  as  accrued  marketing  and  promotion  in  the Accrued  and  other  liabilities  line  item  in  the  Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nCost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials  and  supplies  consumed  in  the  manufacturing  of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expenses necessary to acquire and convert the  purchased  materials  and  supplies  into  finished  products. Cost  of  products  sold  also  includes  the  cost  to  distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs,  warehousing  costs  and  other  shipping  and  handling activity.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expense\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense (SG&amp;A) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research  and  development  costs,  administrative  and  other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items. Research and development costs are charged to  expense  as  incurred  and  were  $2.0  billion  in  2022,  $1.9 billion  in  2021  and  $1.8  billion  in  2020.  Advertising  costs, charged to expense as incurred, include worldwide television, print,  radio,  internet  and  in-store  advertising  expenses  and were $7.9 billion in 2022, $8.2 billion in 2021 and $7.3 billion in 2020. Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending reported  in  SG&amp;A include  costs  associated  with  consumer  promotions,  product sampling and sales aids.",

When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.\n\nThe Walmart U.S. business also includes an in-house advertising offering via Walmart Connect, supply chain and fulfillment capabilities to online marketplace sellers via Walmart Fulfillment Services, and access to quality, affordable healthcare via Walmart Health. In Fiscal 2022, Walmart U.S. initiatives also included the launch of a B2B last mile delivery service platform via Walmart GoLocal, and Walmart Luminate which provides a suite of data products to merchants and suppliers. Additional service offerings include fuel, financial services and related products (including through our digital channels, stores and clubs as well as our previously announced fintech joint venture), such as money orders, prepaid access, money transfers, check cashing, bill payment, and certain types of installment lending. Combined, these offerings do not currently represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues.\n\nOperations. Walmart U.S. is available to customers through supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets, as well as online or through the mobile application 24 hours a day. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart U.S. continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help stores operate more efficiently, such as pickup and delivery, Walmart+, shipfrom-store and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences.\n\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.\n\nCompetition. Walmart U.S. competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercentertype stores, eCommerce retailers, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers, and greater brand recognition. They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.\n\nOur ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. We employ many strategies and programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These strategies include the following:\n\n- EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;\n- EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers;\n- Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery and our Walmart+ membership offering, all of which enhance convenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served; and\n- Expanding our flywheel and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital advertising, fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial services.\n\nDistribution. We utilize a total of 157 distribution facilities which are located strategically throughout the U.S. For fiscal 2022, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 31 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as leveraging our ability to ship or deliver directly from more than 3,500 stores.\n\n## Walmart International Segment\n\nWalmart International is our second largest segment and operated in 23 countries outside of the U.S. as of January 31, 2022. Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, and China, and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa (which includes Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), India, as well as Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua).

          "chunk_text": "We generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as 'structural changes,' which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company's unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's acquisitions and divestitures.\n\n'Acquired brands' refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.\n\n'Licensed brands' refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.\n\nIn January 2023, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Vietnam. The impact of this refranchising has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments. In January, February and December 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in certain territories in India, and in February 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Bangladesh and the Philippines. The impact of each of these refranchisings has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments.\n\nIn May 2023, the Company acquired certain brands in Asia Pacific. The impact of acquiring these brands has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Asia Pacific operating segment.\n\n## Beverage Volume\n\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, 'unit case' means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and 'unit case volume' means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.",

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions; erosion of consumer confidence; competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products; adult smoker willingness to convert to our SFPs; higher product taxes; higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories; unfair competition; and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products, restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our SFPs, or disproportionately impacts the commercialization of our products in relation to our competitors.\n\nCompetitors in our industry include Altria G roup, Inc., British American Tobacco plc, Japan Tobacco Inc., Imperial Brands plc, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, China,  Taiwan,  Thailand  and  V ietnam.  Some  competitors  have  different  profit,  volume  and  regulatory  objectives,  some  international  competitors  may  be  less susceptible than  PMI to changes in currency exchange rates, and some competitors may sell products in circumvention of applicable regulations that compete directly  with  our  products.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative  products  through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior product satisfaction, and without scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our SFPs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. See Item 1, Business-Competition for a description of the competitive environment in which we operate.\n\n## We may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences.\n\nOur  business  is  subject  to  changes  in  adult  consumer  preferences,  which  may  be  influenced  by  local  economic  conditions,  accessibility  to  our  products  and availability of accurate information related to our products.\n\n## To be successful, we must:\n\n- promote brand equity successfully;\n- anticipate and respond to new adult consumer trends;\n- ensure that our products meet our quality standards;\n- develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios;\n- improve productivity;\n- educate and encourage adult smokers to convert to our SFPs;\n- ensure effective adult consumer engagement, including communication about product characteristics and usage of SFPs;\n- mitigate the impact of developments that cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands;\n- provide excellent customer care;\n- ensure adequate production capacity to meet demand for our products; and\n- be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases.\n\nIn periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may tend to purchase low-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could be materially adversely impacted as a result. Such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation. In addition to economic uncertainty (including recessions and inflation) unusual weather events and global or local epidemics, endemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19) has and may change the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for our mid-price or premium-price brands.\n\n## Our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets, maintain sufficient production capacity, or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.\n\nOur profit growth may be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to meet the demand for our products with increased production capacity, to raise prices, or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) is managing raw material cost volatility through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives, and limited commodity hedging, particularly in its Hill's Pet Nutrition segment. Coca-Cola (KO) acknowledges that while it attempts to offset cost pressures through price increases, it may not be able to fully compensate for rising input costs through productivity initiatives alone, indicating a more constrained approach. Mondelez (MDLZ) actively manages operating costs through cost-saving and productivity initiatives, such as its 'Simplify to Grow' program, which targets significant reductions in supply chain and overhead costs. Comparing these approaches, CL and MDLZ are proactively embedding productivity initiatives into their cost management frameworks, while KO expresses uncertainty about the sufficiency of such measures in mitigating inflationary pressures.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive notes that economic instability affects consumer demand and increases the cost of raw materials, labor, and logistics, particularly in international markets where 70% of its net sales originate. Costco highlights exposure to macroeconomic volatility, especially in less stable international regions, and emphasizes risks from trade policies, tariffs, and supply chain disruptions. Walmart identifies economic instability as a risk to supplier reliability and global sourcing, particularly in countries facing political or economic turmoil, and warns of potential disruptions to product availability and increased costs. Collectively, the three companies illustrate how economic instability affects global consumer staples firms through supply chain fragility, shifting consumer behavior, and regulatory unpredictability.",

        "Hop 1: CL \u2192 Economic Instability: Colgate-Palmolive states that economic instability impacts consumer confidence and consumption, potentially reducing sales volumes or shifting product mix to lower-margin offerings, with 70% of net sales from international markets.",
        "Hop 2: COST \u2192 Economic Instability: Costco notes that economic instability in international regions affects trade policies, tariffs, and supply chain continuity, increasing the complexity and cost of global operations.",

If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.\n\n## Business and Industry Risks\n\n## We face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nWe operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately 70% of our Net sales originating in markets outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we face risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:\n\n- changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of inflation, volatile commodity prices and increases in the cost of raw and packaging materials, labor, energy and logistics;\n- political or economic instability, geopolitical events, environmental events, widespread health emergencies, such as COVID19 or other pandemics or epidemics, natural disasters or social or labor unrest;\n- changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows from non-U.S. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars, in those markets;\n- exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import or export raw materials or finished product, including as a result of COVID-19, or to repatriate earnings from overseas;\n- lack of well-established, reliable and/or impartial legal systems in certain countries where we operate and difficulties in enforcing contractual, intellectual property or other legal rights;\n- foreign ownership and investment restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources; and\n- changes to trade policies and agreements and other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of and/or the increase in onerous trade restrictions and/or tariffs, sanctions, price controls, labor laws, travel or immigration restrictions, including as a result of COVID-19 or other pandemics or epidemics, profit controls or other government controls.\n\nAny or all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings.\n\nIn addition, there continue to be uncertainties related to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union ('EU') (commonly referred to as Brexit), including the long-term impact of the bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU (the 'EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement'). These uncertainties include the impact of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on businesses in the EU and the United Kingdom and how the new relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom will develop over time, including disruptions to trade and the free movement of goods, services and people to and from the United Kingdom, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the British pound and/or the euro and disruptions to our workforce and that of",

Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions), monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights.\n\n## Changes  in  accounting  standards  and  subjective  assumptions,  estimates  and  judgments  by  management related  to  complex  accounting  matters  could  significantly  affect  our  financial  condition  and  results  of operations.\n\nAccounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including self-insurance liabilities, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying  assumptions,  estimates  or  judgments  by  our  management  could  significantly  change  our  reported  or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## We are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\nSection  404  of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act  of  2002  requires  management  assessments  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.\n\n## Changes in tax rates, new U.S. or foreign tax legislation, and exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally,  at  any  point  in  time,  we  may  be  under  examination  for  value  added,  sales-based,  payroll, product,  import  or  other  non-income  taxes.  We  may  recognize  additional  tax  expense,  be  subject  to  additional  tax liabilities,  or  incur  losses  and  penalties,  due  to  changes  in  laws,  regulations,  administrative  practices,  principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries,  a  change  in  earnings  attributable  to  the  various  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate  could  result  in  an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Significant  changes  in  or  failure  to  comply  with  regulations  relating  to  the  use,  storage,  discharge  and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are  subject  to  a  wide  and  increasingly  broad  array  of  federal,  state,  regional,  local  and  international  laws  and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes  and  other  environmental  matters.  Failure  to  comply  with  these  laws  could  result  in  harm  to  our  members, employees or others, significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or  the  imposition  of  severe  penalties  or  restrictions  on  operations  by  governmental  agencies  or  courts  that  could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",

Certain impacts of physical risk may include: temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at stores, clubs, and distribution or fulfillment centers; extreme weather patterns that affect the production or sourcing of certain commodities; flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory; and heat and extreme weather events that cause long-term disruption or threats to the habitability of the communities in which Walmart operates. Relative to transition risk, certain impacts may include: changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate-related weather events; prolonged climate-related events affecting macroeconomic conditions with related effects on consumer spending and confidence; stakeholder perception of our engagement in climate-related policies; and new regulatory requirements resulting in higher compliance risk and operational costs.\n\nWe bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\n## Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner and in the large volumes we may demand, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.\n\nPolitical and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries and entities, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nIf the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance. We are also subject to reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms.\n\nOur customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. Whether laws related to these marketplace transactions apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes could expose us to loss of sales, reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen, or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law or the proprietary rights of others. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommerce growth and flywheel strategy.",

The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. During 2021, we experienced higher than anticipated transportation and commodity costs, which we expect to continue in 2022. A number of external factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse weather  conditions,  supply  chain  disruptions  (including  raw  material  shortages)  and  labor  shortages,  have impacted  and  may  continue  to  impact  transportation  and  commodity  availability  and  costs.  When  prices increase,  we  may  or  may  not  pass  on  such  increases  to  our  customers  without  suffering  reduced  volume, revenue, margins and operating results.\n\nSee Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices.\n\n## Risks Associated with Climate Change\n\nCertain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or  are  considering imposing, new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing  programs.  These  new  or  increased  legal  or  regulatory  requirements  could  result  in  significant increased costs of compliance and additional investments in facilities and equipment. However, we are unable to  predict  the  scope,  nature  and  timing  of  any  new  or  increased  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. We continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations.\n\n## Risks Associated with International Operations\n\nWe are subject to risks in the normal course of business that are inherent to international operations. During the  periods  presented  in  this  report,  certain  jurisdictions  in  which  our  products  are  made,  manufactured, distributed  or  sold,  including  in  certain  developing  and  emerging  markets,  operated  in  a  challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and  political  environment  in  these  markets  closely  and  to  identify  actions  to  potentially  mitigate  any unfavorable impacts on our future results.\n\n## Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products\n\nCertain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging,  commodities  used  in  the  production  of  our  products  or  their  packaging  or  the  recyclability  or recoverability  of  our  packaging.  These  taxes  and  regulations  vary  in  scope  and  form.  For  example,  some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in increased regulatory focus on labeling in certain jurisdictions, including in Mexico which enacted product labeling requirements and limitations on the marketing of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging,",

References to our sustainability reports and website are for informational purposes  only  and  neither  the  sustainability  reports  nor  the other information on our website is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nWe  discuss  our  expectations  regarding  future  performance, events  and  outcomes,  such  as  our  business  outlook  and objectives in this Form 10-K, as well as in our quarterly and annual reports, current reports on Form 8-K, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for  historical  and  present  factual  information,  are  'forwardlooking  statements'  and  are  based  on  financial  data  and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. We assume no  obligation  to  update  any  forward-looking  statements  as  a result  of  new  information,  future  events  or  other  factors, except to the extent required by law. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize  that events could  significantly differ  from  our expectations.\n\nThe following discussion of 'risk factors' identifies significant factors  that  may  adversely  affect  our  business,  operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and  Analysis and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes incorporated in this report. The following  discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider  when  evaluating  our  expectations.  These  and  other factors  could  cause  our  future  results  to  differ  from  those  in the  forward-looking  statements  and  from  historical  trends, perhaps materially.\n\n## MACROECONOMIC  CONDITIONS  AND  RELATED FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nOur  business  is  subject  to  numerous  risks  as  a  result  of having  significant  operations  and  sales  in  international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility.\n\nWe are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries  and  products  sold  in  approximately  180  countries and territories around the world.  We  hold assets, incur liabilities,  generate  sales  and  pay  expenses  in  a  variety  of currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar,  and  our  operations outside the U.S. generate more than fifty percent of our annual net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have  and  could  continue  to  reduce  the  U.S.  dollar  value  of sales,  earnings  and  cash  flows  we  receive  from  non-U.S. markets,  increase  our  supply  costs  (as  measured  in  U.S. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition. Further, we have  a significant  amount  of  foreign  currency  debt  and derivatives  as part of  our  capital  markets  activities.  The maturity cash outflows of these instruments could be adversely impacted by significant appreciation of foreign currency exchange rates (particularly the Euro), which could adversely impact  our  overall  cash  flows.  Moreover,  discriminatory  or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries, including  changes  to  tariffs  and  existing  trade  policies  and agreements,  could  adversely  affect  our  results.  See  also  the Results of Operations and Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity sections of the MD&amp;A  and  the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.\n\nWe  also  have  businesses  and  maintain  local  currency  cash balances  in  a  number  of  countries  with  currency  exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls or restrictions, such as Nigeria, Turkey, Argentina and Egypt. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could  be adversely  impacted  if  we  are  unable  to  successfully  manage such controls and restrictions, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased  tariffs,  quotas,  exchange  or  price  controls,  trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business.\n\nAdditionally, our business, operations or employees have been and could continue to be adversely affected (including by the need  to  de-consolidate  or  even  exit  certain  businesses  in particular countries) by political volatility, labor market disruptions  or  other  crises  or  vulnerabilities  in  individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval or acts of war (such as the Russia-Ukraine War) and the related government and other entity responses, broad  economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration  in  the  creditworthiness  of  local  governments, particularly in emerging markets.\n\nUncertain  economic  or  social  conditions  may  adversely impact  demand  for  our  products  or  cause  our  customers and  other  business  partners  to  suffer  financial  hardship, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand  for  our  products  related  to  one  or  more  significant local, regional or global economic or social disruptions. These disruptions  have  included  and  may  in  the  future  include:  a slow-down, recession or inflationary pressures in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for  our  suppliers,  vendors  or  customers;  a  significant  shift  in government policies; significant social unrest; the deterioration of economic  relations between  countries or regions, including potential negative consumer sentiment toward  non-local  products  or  sources;  or  the  inability  to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries  to  pay  funds  to  or  collect  funds  from  our customers,  vendors  and  suppliers.  Additionally,  these  and other economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third-party partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services  we  need,  in  which  case  our  business  and  results  of operations could be adversely affected.",

These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nIf the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance. We are also subject to reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms.\n\nOur customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. Whether laws related to these marketplace transactions apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes could expose us to loss of sales, reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen, or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law or the proprietary rights of others. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommerce growth and flywheel strategy.",

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola (KO), PepsiCo (PEP), and Procter & Gamble (PG) each characterize their exposure to geopolitical risks in 2023, particularly in relation to their operations in emerging markets such as Russia, Ukraine, and the Middle East?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) notes that geopolitical conditions, including international conflicts, impact the beverage industry through supply chain disruptions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and regulatory changes, though it does not specify particular regions or quantify the impact. PepsiCo (PEP) explicitly mentions the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East as sources of geopolitical risk, affecting global economic stability and the movement of goods, and notes that these conditions could impact its operations and financial performance. Procter & Gamble (PG) specifically references the Russia-Ukraine war, stating it has already negatively affected operations, leading to reduced product offerings, halted investments, and potential future impairments of assets in Russia, while also warning of broader implications such as inflation and supply chain disruptions across Europe. Collectively, these companies highlight varying degrees of exposure to geopolitical instability, with PG being the most specific and impacted due to its actions in Russia.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: KO \u2192 Geopolitical Conditions: KO mentions that geopolitical conditions, including international conflicts, affect the beverage industry through cost fluctuations, regulatory changes, and foreign currency exchange rate volatility, but does not specify regions or quantify the impact.",
        "Hop 2: PEP \u2192 Geopolitical Conditions: PEP explicitly names the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East as geopolitical risks, noting that these events can disrupt the movement of goods, create economic uncertainty, and affect demand for products globally.",
        "Hop 3: PG \u2192 Geopolitical Conditions: PG provides the most detailed account, specifically citing the Russia-Ukraine war as a direct cause of operational changes, including reduced product offerings, halted investments, and potential asset impairments in Russia, while also warning of broader economic effects across Europe."

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble highlights Argentina as a country with significant foreign exchange volatility that has historically impacted its net sales, costs, and earnings. The company actively manages exposure in such markets, including Argentina, through pricing and cost optimization strategies. Philip Morris International notes Argentina in the context of restructuring, having incurred $15 million in asset impairment and exit costs related to cigarette plant closures in 2019, signaling a strategic reduction of footprint in the region. Walmart previously operated in Argentina but sold off its operations in fiscal 2021, indicating a broader exit from the market as part of its international portfolio optimization. Together, these perspectives show that Argentina posed distinct challenges and strategic considerations for each company\u2014currency risk for P&G, operational restructuring for PMI, and market exit for Walmart\u2014reflecting varied risk-return assessments across the consumer staples sector.",

Net  sales  could  also  be  adversely  impacted  following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on the consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including     supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. If we  are not successful in  executing  and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our  gross  margin,  operating  margin,  net  earnings  and  cash flows.\n\nForeign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure  to  the  fluctuation  of  exchange  rates.  Translation exposures relate to exchange  rate impacts of  measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a  currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation  of  transaction-related  working  capital  balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In  the  past  three  years,  a  number  of  foreign  currencies  have weakened  versus  the  U.S.  dollar,  leading  to  lower  sales  and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries  that  recently  had  and  are  currently  experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Russia. These fluctuations have significantly  impacted  our  historical  net  sales,  costs  and  net earnings  and  could  do  so  in  the  future.  Increased  pricing  in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  may  offset  portions  of  the  currency  impacts  but  could also  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  consumption  of  our products,  which  would  negatively  affect  our  net  sales,  gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nGovernment Policies. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative,  regulatory  or  enforcement  policies.  For  example, our  net  earnings  and  cash  flows  could  be  affected  by  any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under  the  current  work  being  led  by  the  OECD  for  the  G20 focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the  Economy.\"  The  breadth  of  the  OECD  project  extends beyond pure digital businesses, and if agreed and enacted by most  countries,  is  likely  to  impact  most  large  multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and broadly  establishing  a  15%  minimum  tax  on  their  foreign operations. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and  climate change  matters.  Additionally, we  attempt  to carefully  manage  our  debt,  currency  and  other  exposures  in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and  pricing  controls,  such  as  Nigeria,  Turkey, Argentina  and Egypt. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere.  Changes  in  government  policies  in  these  areas might  cause  an  increase  or  decrease  in  our  net  sales,  gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nCOVID-19  Pandemic. Because  we  sell  products  that  are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nHowever, the continued evolution of the pandemic may result in economic recessions or a slowdown of economic growth in certain countries or regions. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products (due to governmental actions or  key  material,  transportation  and  labor  shortages  impacting our  ability  to  produce  and  ship  products)  or  could  impact consumers'  movements  and  access  to  our  products.  There could also be reduced demand due to consumption decreases and consumer pantry destocking (particularly, in home cleaning,  health  and  hygiene  products)  as  economic  activity resumes  following  slowdowns  or  relaxation  of  governmental restrictions.  Net,  the  uncertainty  in  the  timing  and  extent  of demand  volatility,  the  relaxation  and  reimplementation  of movement  restrictions,  the  timing  and  impact  of  potential consumer pantry destocking, the future economic trends due to a  resurgence  of  positive  cases  and  governmental  actions  in response  to  the  pandemic  may  result  in  heightened  volatility and negative impacts to net sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the pandemic.\n\nWhile we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets due primarily to the restriction of employee movements, key material and labor shortages and transportation constraints. We intend to continue to work with our suppliers and government authorities to implement employee  safety  measures  to  minimize  disruption  to  the manufacturing and distribution of our products. The continued evolution of the pandemic and uncertainty with regards to the disruptions  caused  either  by  resurgence  of  positive  cases  or governmental actions in response to the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain and impact our operations (for example, the closure of a key manufacturing or distribution  facility  or  the  inability  of  a  key  material  or transportation supplier to source and transport materials).\n\nThe pandemic has not had a material negative impact on the Company's liquidity position. We continue to generate operating  cash  flows  to  meet  our  short-term  liquidity  needs and continue to maintain access to capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings.\n\nRussia-Ukraine  War .  The  war  between  Russia  and  Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both countries. Our Ukraine  business  includes  two  manufacturing  sites.  We  have approximately  500  employees  including  both  manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. Our operations in Ukraine accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in fiscal 2022. Additionally, net assets of our Ukraine subsidiary, along",

Organic sales in Latin America increased 8.0% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in Latin America in 2021 versus 2020 was due to increases in Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care organic sales.

See 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' for further discussion.\n\n## Commodity Prices\n\nOur  commodity  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $1.6  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $1.1 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  At  the  end  of  2021,  the  potential  change  in  fair  value  of  commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $177 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nOur operations outside of the United States generated 44% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa, collectively, comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks  in  the  international  markets  in  which  our  products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2021,  favorable  foreign  exchange  contributed  1  percentage  point  to  net  revenue  growth,  primarily  due  to appreciation  in  the  Mexican  peso,  Canadian  dollar  and  South African  rand.  Currency  declines  against  the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.\n\nIn addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold,  including  in Argentina,  Brazil,  China,  Mexico,  the Middle  East,  Russia  and  Turkey,  and  currency  controls  or  fluctuations  in  certain  of  these  international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments.\n\nOur foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $1.9 billion  as  of  December 26, 2020. At the end of 2021, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $278 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.\n\nThe total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nOur interest  rate  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $2.1  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $3.0 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  Assuming  year-end  2021  investment  levels  and  variable  rate  debt,  a  1percentage-point  increase  in  interest  rates  would  have  decreased  our  net  interest  expense  in  2021  by  $47 million  due  to  higher  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  levels,  as  compared  with  our variable rate debt.\n\n## OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\n## Results of Operations - Consolidated Review\n\n## Volume\n\nPhysical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions,  including  the  preparation  of  our  annual  operating  plan  and  the  evaluation  of  our  business performance.

Mondelez (MDLZ) applies weighted-average assumptions to calculate net periodic postretirement healthcare costs, with costs of $(5) million, $12 million, and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Philip Morris (PM) also uses weighted-average assumptions in determining net pension and postretirement healthcare costs, with settlement and curtailment charges primarily driven by employee severance and early retirement programs. These differing applications reflect distinct focuses: KO centers on equity-based compensation, MDLZ on postretirement healthcare, and PM on pension and workforce restructuring liabilities.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive reports that sales to Walmart represented 12%, 12%, and 11% of net sales in 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively, indicating a consistent and significant portion of revenue tied to the retailer. PepsiCo discloses that in 2021, sales to Walmart and its affiliates represented approximately 13% of its consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to independent bottlers used in finished goods sold to Walmart. Procter & Gamble, while mentioning Walmart as a major customer, does not provide a specific revenue percentage in its 2022 filing, suggesting a less transparent or potentially smaller exposure compared to the other two. Collectively, this indicates that while all three consumer staples companies rely on Walmart as a key customer, the degree of dependency varies, with PepsiCo and Colgate showing more pronounced exposure than Procter & Gamble.",

Segment Information\n\nThe Company operates in two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition.\n\nThe operations of the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment are managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia.\n\nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of Corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intercompany sales have been eliminated. Corporate operations include costs related to stock options and restricted stock units, research and development costs, Corporate overhead costs, restructuring and related implementation charges and gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets. The Company reports these items within Corporate operations as they relate to Corporate-based responsibilities and decisions and are not included in the internal measures of segment operating performance used by the Company to measure the underlying performance of the operating segments.\n\nApproximately 70% of the Company's Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45% of the Company's Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). Oral, Personal and Home Care sales to Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 12%, 12% and 11% of the Company's Net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No other customer represented more than 10% of Net sales in any period presented.\n\nIn 2021, Corporate Operating profit included goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges of $571, and a benefit of $26 related to a value-added tax matter in Brazil. In 2020, Corporate Operating profit included benefits of $16 resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and a charge of $6 for acquisition-related costs. In 2019, Corporate Operating profit included charges of $125 resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, a charge of $24 for acquisition-related costs and a benefit of $30 from a value-added tax matter in Brazil.\n\n98\n\n",

These assets are reported in the country where they are primarily used.\n\n- (b) The increase in net revenue reflects our acquisition of Be &amp; Cheery. See Note 13 for further information.\n- (c) The increase in net revenue reflects our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. See Note 13 for further information.\n\n## Note 2 - Our Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Merchandising  activities  are  immaterial  in  the  context  of  our  contracts.  In  addition,  we  exclude  from  net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue producing transactions.\n\nThe transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for  a  right  of  return.  However,  our  policy  for  DSD,  including  certain  chilled  products,  is  to  remove  and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality  and  freshness  they  expect.  Similarly,  our  policy  for  certain  warehouse-distributed  products  is  to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.\n\nOur products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.\n\nWe estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and  collectibility,  write-off  history,  the  aging  of  accounts  receivable,  our  analysis  of  customer  data,  and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.\n\nWe are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers. In 2021, sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam's) represented  approximately  13%  of  our  consolidated  net  revenue,  including  concentrate  sales  to  our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart.\n\n## Total Marketplace Spending\n\nWe  offer  sales  incentives  and  discounts  through  various  programs  to  customers  and  consumers.  Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives  and  discounts  are  primarily  accounted  for  as  a  reduction  of  revenue  and  include  payments  to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution  of  new  products,  payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives  and  discounts  also  include  support  provided  to  our  independent  bottlers  through  funding  of advertising and other marketing activities.\n\nA  number  of  our  sales  incentives,  such  as  bottler  funding  to  independent  bottlers  and  customer  volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for  the  expected  payout,  which  may  occur  after  year  end  once  reconciled  and  settled.  These  accruals  are based  on  contract  terms  and  our  historical  experience  with  similar  programs  and  require  management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 1\n\n## SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company's (the \"Company,\" \"Procter &amp; Gamble,\"  \"we\"  or  \"us\")  business  is  focused  on  providing branded  consumer  packaged  goods  of  superior  quality  and value.  Our  products  are  sold  in  approximately  180  countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, ecommerce  (including  social  commerce)  channels,  grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors,  wholesalers,  specialty  beauty  stores  (including airport  duty-free  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies, electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell direct  to  consumers.  We  have  on-the-ground  operations  in approximately 70 countries.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its  controlled  subsidiaries.  Intercompany  transactions  are eliminated.\n\nBecause  of  a  lack  of  control  over  Venezuelan  subsidiaries caused by a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not consolidated  for  any  year  presented.  We  account  for  those subsidiaries at cost, less impairments, plus or minus observable price changes.\n\nBeginning in fiscal year 2022, the Company began to present increases and reductions in short-term debt with maturities of more  than  three  months  separately  within  the  Consolidated Statements  of  Cash  Flows.  The  presentation  for  the  twelve months  ended  June  30,  2021,  and  June  30,  2020,  have  been revised  to  align  with  the  current  period  presentation.  This change  had  no  impact  on  total  financing  activities,  and  we have concluded the change is not material.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of  America  (U.S.  GAAP)  requires  management  to  make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge  of  current  events  and  actions  the  Company  may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among  other  items,  consumer  and  trade  promotion  accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, postretirement benefits, stock options,  valuation  of  acquired  intangible  assets,  useful  lives for  depreciation  and  amortization  of  long-lived  assets,  future cash  flows  associated  with  impairment  testing  for  goodwill, indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  and  other  long-lived  assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax positions  and  contingencies.  Actual  results  may  ultimately differ from estimates, although management does not generally believe such differences would materially affect the financial statements in any individual year. However, regarding ongoing  impairment  testing  of  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus  those  anticipated  at  the  time  of  the  initial  valuations, could  result  in  impairment  charges  that  materially  affect  the financial statements in a given year.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product  to  customers.  Those  sales  predominantly  contain  a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single  point  in  time  when  ownership,  risks  and  rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt  by  the  customer.  A  provision  for  payment  discounts and  product  return  allowances  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of sales  in  the  same  period  the  revenue  is  recognized.  The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect  on  behalf  of  governmental  authorities.  The  revenue includes  shipping  and  handling  costs,  which  generally  are included in the list price to the customer.\n\nTrade  promotions,  consisting  primarily  of  customer  pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending,  which  is  recognized  as  incurred  at  the  time  of  the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are  included  as  accrued  marketing  and  promotion  in  the Accrued  and  other  liabilities  line  item  in  the  Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nCost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials  and  supplies  consumed  in  the  manufacturing  of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expenses necessary to acquire and convert the  purchased  materials  and  supplies  into  finished  products. Cost  of  products  sold  also  includes  the  cost  to  distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs,  warehousing  costs  and  other  shipping  and  handling activity.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expense\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense (SG&amp;A) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research  and  development  costs,  administrative  and  other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items. Research and development costs are charged to  expense  as  incurred  and  were  $2.0  billion  in  2022,  $1.9 billion  in  2021  and  $1.8  billion  in  2020.  Advertising  costs, charged to expense as incurred, include worldwide television, print,  radio,  internet  and  in-store  advertising  expenses  and were $7.9 billion in 2022, $8.2 billion in 2021 and $7.3 billion in 2020. Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending reported  in  SG&amp;A include  costs  associated  with  consumer  promotions,  product sampling and sales aids.",

Advertising costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred. Certain consumer and trade promotional programs, such as consumer coupons, are recorded as a reduction of sales.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe cost of approximately 75% of inventories is determined using the FIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of all other inventories, in the U.S. and Mexico, is determined using the LIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories in excess of one year of forecasted sales are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent 'Other assets.'\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nLand, buildings and machinery and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided, primarily using the straight-line method, over-estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings. Depreciation attributable to manufacturing operations is included in Cost of sales. The remaining component of depreciation is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangibles\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the Company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Other intangible assets with finite lives, such as local brands and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 40 years. Amortization expense related to intangible assets is included in Other (income) expense, net, which is included in Operating profit.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect at the time such differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive model to recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on an income tax return.

          "chunk_text": "recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models. These appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\n\n## Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets\n\nIntangible assets are classified into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, recoverability tests must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, impairment tests must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.\n\nThe performance of recoverability and impairment tests of intangible assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term growth rates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers' financial condition. These factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we use when performing recoverability tests of intangible assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. Refer to the heading 'Operations Review' below for additional information related to our present business environment.\n\nIntangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. Additionally, we are required to ensure that the assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our Company's actual cost of capital has changed. Therefore, if the cost of capital and/or discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts.\n\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller geographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa, innocent and do\u011fadan businesses as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.\n\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. However, the impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.",

In addition, amortizable intangible assets,  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  other  long-lived  assets  are  evaluated  for  impairment  upon  a significant  change  in  the  operating  or  macroeconomic  environment.  A  deterioration  in  our  underlying assumptions regarding the impact of competitive operating conditions, macroeconomic conditions or other factors  used  to  estimate  the  future  performance  of  any  of  our  reporting  units  or  assets,  including  any deterioration in the weighted-average cost of capital based on market data available at the time, can result in an impairment charge, which can adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n## Fluctuations in exchange rates impact our financial performance.\n\nBecause our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries  outside  the  United  States,  where  the  functional  currency  is  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar,  are translated into U.S. dollars.

We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates. Any downgrade or announcement  that  we  are  under  review  for  a  potential  downgrade  of  our  credit  ratings,  especially  any downgrade to below investment grade, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital  and  credit  markets  on  terms  commercially  acceptable  to  us  or  at  all,  result  in  a  reduction  in  our liquidity, or impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced  historically  (and  therefore  require  us  to  rely  more  heavily  on  more  expensive  types  of  debt financing), all of which can adversely affect our financial performance.\n\n## Legal, Tax and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Taxes aimed at our products can adversely affect our business or financial performance.\n\nCertain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of certain of our products, particularly our beverages, as a result of the ingredients or substances contained in our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing  over  a  certain  amount  of  added  sugar  (or  other  sweetener),  some  apply  a  graduated  tax  rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and others apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing any amount of added sugar (or other sweetener).

      "answer": "MDLZ provides detailed quantitative disclosures on performance share units, including annual grants (e.g., 895,410 units in 2023), vesting amounts (e.g., 1,772,439 shares vested in 2023), and fair value metrics (e.g., $68.59 per share for 2023 grants). PM discloses potential issuance of 2,854,560 shares from performance share units upon achieving maximum performance targets, indicating a strong performance-based alignment mechanism. WMT focuses on broader equity compensation alignment through its Stock Incentive Plan, with vesting schedules varying by grant period (e.g., 8% quarterly vesting starting in fiscal 2023), emphasizing long-term associate-shareholder alignment. Together, these reveal differing emphases: MDLZ on detailed transparency and annual tracking, PM on performance thresholds, and WMT on long-term alignment across a broader associate base.",

      "answer": "MDLZ, PEP, and TGT all incorporate non-lease components into their lease accounting, but they differ in how they describe and manage these elements. MDLZ explicitly states that it accounts for lease and non-lease components (e.g., product costs, common-area or other maintenance costs) as a single lease component. PEP notes that for real estate leases, it accounts for lease components together with non-lease components such as common-area maintenance, but does not specify the nature of other non-lease elements. TGT combines lease and nonlease components for new and reassessed leases but also highlights specific types of variable payments such as real estate taxes, common area maintenance, and insurance reimbursements. These differences suggest that while all three companies integrate non-lease costs into their lease accounting, MDLZ and TGT provide more detailed categorization of these expenses, whereas PEP offers a more generalized approach, potentially reflecting different levels of granularity in cost management and lease structuring.",

        "Hop 1: MDLZ \u2192 Non-Lease Components: MDLZ explicitly states that many of its leases contain non-lease components such as product costs, common-area or other maintenance costs, and accounts for both lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.",
        "Hop 2: PEP \u2192 Non-Lease Components: PEP indicates that its real estate leases include non-lease components like common-area maintenance, but does not elaborate further on other types of non-lease elements or how they are quantified.",
        "Hop 3: TGT \u2192 Non-Lease Components: TGT combines lease and nonlease components for new and reassessed leases and specifically identifies real estate taxes, common area maintenance, insurance, and sales-based rent adjustments as variable payments tied to lease agreements."

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola (KO), Mondelez (MDLZ), and Walmart (WMT) each articulate their exposure to competitive pressures in the consumer staples sector, and what does this reveal about how each company prioritizes mitigating these risks through operational, pricing, and strategic responses?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) emphasizes that evolving consumer preferences, particularly around health and wellness, and the rapid digital transformation of shopping behaviors, pose significant competitive risks. KO highlights the need to innovate and adapt its product portfolio and digital commerce initiatives to maintain market share and revenue growth. Mondelez (MDLZ) notes that competitive pressures require timely responses to channel shifts and pricing dynamics, especially in the context of rising commodity costs and the rapid growth of discounters and digital commerce. MDLZ has increased investments in digital and new distribution channels to protect revenues and brand relevance. Walmart (WMT) operates in a highly competitive omni-channel retail environment and faces pressures from a broad range of competitors, including discounters, eCommerce platforms, and specialty retailers. WMT has responded by strengthening its international portfolio through divestitures and focusing on omni-channel integration to maintain competitive advantage. Collectively, these responses show that while all three face competitive pressures, KO focuses on consumer health trends and digital transformation, MDLZ emphasizes pricing and channel agility, and WMT prioritizes strategic portfolio optimization and omni-channel retail execution.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: KO \u2192 Competitive Pressures: KO identifies evolving consumer preferences\u2014especially around health, wellness, and digital shopping\u2014as key risks. Failure to innovate or adapt digital transformation initiatives could negatively affect revenue growth and market share.",
        "Hop 2: MDLZ \u2192 Competitive Pressures: MDLZ states that competitor and customer pressures require timely responses to distribution channel shifts and pricing dynamics. The company has increased investments in digital commerce and new technologies to protect revenues and respond to inflationary and competitive forces.",
        "Hop 3: WMT \u2192 Competitive Pressures: WMT highlights intense omni-channel retail competition and has responded with strategic divestitures (e.g., Walmart Argentina, Asda, Seiyu) and a focus on strengthening its global omni-channel capabilities to remain competitive."

Our third-party service providers and business partners may not fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreedupon terms. In addition, while we have procedures in place for selecting and managing our relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, or for any reason our third-party service providers or business partners fail to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, our financial results could suffer.\n\n## If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or if we or our bottling partners experience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our business could suffer.\n\nMany of our employees at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we generally have been able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and regard our relations with employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory, negotiations may nevertheless be challenging, as the Company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our employees. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which could affect our profit margins. In addition, many of our bottling partners' employees are represented by labor unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or at our bottling operations or our major bottlers' plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers' ability to supply finished beverages to customers, which could reduce our net operating revenues and could expose us to customer claims. Furthermore, from time to time we and our bottling partners restructure manufacturing and other operations to improve productivity, which may have negative impacts on employee morale and work performance, result in escalation of grievances and adversely affect the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements. If these labor relations are not effectively managed at the local level, they could escalate in the form of corporate campaigns supported by the labor organizations and could negatively affect our Company's overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products' acceptance by consumers.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS\n\n## Obesity and other health-related concerns may reduce demand for some of our products.\n\nThere is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about the health problems associated with obesity. Increasing public concern about obesity; other health-related public concerns surrounding consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages; possible new or increased taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages by government entities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue; additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our sugar-sweetened beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sugar-sweetened beverages may reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, our sugar-sweetened beverages, which could adversely affect our profitability.\n\n## If we do not address evolving consumer product and shopping preferences, our business could suffer.\n\nConsumer product preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sugar-sweetened beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients; shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer tastes and needs coupled with a rapid expansion of beverage options and delivery methods; changes in consumer lifestyles; concerns regarding location of origin or source of ingredients and raw materials and the environmental, social and sustainability impact of ingredient sources and the product manufacturing process; consumer emphasis on transparency related to ingredients we use in our products and collection and recyclability of, and amount of recycled content contained in, our packaging containers and other materials; concerns about the health and welfare of animals in our dairy supply chain; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, in many of our markets, shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with consumers rapidly embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms. If we fail to address changes in consumer product and shopping preferences, do not successfully anticipate and prepare for future changes in such preferences, or are ineffective or slow in developing and implementing appropriate digital transformation initiatives, our share of sales, revenue growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.\n\n## Product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.\n\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards, which we expect our operations as well as our bottling partners to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our bottling partners periodically have not met, and may not always meet, these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions into beverage categories, such as value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, that are beyond our",

We expect commodity cost volatility to continue, and our commodity hedging activities cannot fully offset this volatility.\n- Further disruptions or uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic could result in delays or modifications to our strategic plans and initiatives.\n- Illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism or other workforce disruptions have affected and could materially negatively affect our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution or other business processes. The pandemic has also necessitated increased expenditures to secure the safety and effectiveness of our personnel and operations.\n- Government or regulatory responses to pandemics could negatively impact our business. Mandatory lockdowns or other restrictions on operations in some countries temporarily disrupted our ability to distribute our products in some markets. Resumption, continuation or expansion of these disruptions could materially adversely impact our operations and results.\n- Initially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. dollar appreciated materially against other currencies in the countries in which we operate, resulting in currency translation losses. If the U.S. dollar were to appreciate again against some or all of those same currencies, the resulting currency translation losses, along with currency transaction losses, could adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition.\n- The COVID-19 outbreak initially increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets and commercial paper markets, and volatility may increase again as COVID-19 evolves. We might not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like or on terms we find acceptable, and our borrowing costs could increase. An economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed. A disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties for a number of our derivative contracts.\n\nThese and other impacts of the COVID-19 or other global or regional health pandemics or epidemics could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors below, including but not limited to those relating to our reputation, brands, consumer preferences, supply chain, product sales, results of operations or financial condition. We might not be able to predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near- or long-term adverse impacts to our results. The ultimate impact of these disruptions also depends on events beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 and other pandemics or epidemics and actions taken by parties other than us to respond to them, and in the case of COVID-19, on the emergence and spread of COVID-19 variants including Omicron. Any of these disruptions could have a negative impact on our business operations, financial performance, results of operations and stock price, and this impact could be material. Additionally, COVID-19 may also materially adversely affect our operating results and financial position in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and we face risks related to the execution of our strategy and our timely response to channel shifts and pricing and other competitive pressures.\n\nThe food and snacking industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors include food, snack and beverage companies that operate in multiple geographic areas and numerous local and regional companies. Failure to effectively respond to challenges from our competitors could adversely affect our business.\n\nCompetitor and customer pressures require that we timely and effectively respond to changes in distribution channels and technological developments that may require changes in our prices. These pressures could affect our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases. Failure to effectively and timely assess new or developing trends, technological advancements or changes in distribution methods and set proper pricing, including as a result of inflation, or effective trade incentives could negatively impact demand for our products, our operating results, achievement of our strategic and financial goals and our ability to capitalize on new revenue or value-producing opportunities. The rapid growth of some channels, such as discounters as well as digital commerce which has expanded significantly following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, may impact our current operations or strategies more quickly than we planned for, create consumer price deflation, alter the buying behavior of consumers or disrupt our retail customer relationships. We may need to increase or reallocate spending on existing and new distribution channels and technologies, marketing, advertising and new product innovation to protect or increase revenues, market share and brand significance. These expenditures may not be successful, including those related to our digital commerce and other technology-focused efforts, and might not result in trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Overview\n\nThis discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 (\"fiscal 2022\"), January 31, 2021 (\"fiscal 2021\") and January 31, 2020 (\"fiscal 2020\"), should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial position and results of operations of the Company as a whole.\n\nThroughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.  Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.\n\nManagement also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as \"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nIn discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future.\n\nWe have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, including the following highlights over the last three years:\n\n- In November 2020, we completed the sale of Walmart Argentina and recorded a pre-tax non-cash loss in fiscal 2021 of $1.0 billion, primarily due to cumulative foreign currency translation losses. Refer to Note 12.\n- In February 2021, we completed the sale of Asda for net consideration of $9.6 billion, for which we recognized an estimated pre-tax loss in fiscal 2021 of $5.5 billion, and an incremental loss of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing of the transaction. Refer to Note 11 and Note 12.\n- In March 2021, we completed the sale of Seiyu for net consideration of $1.2 billion, for which we recognized an estimated pre-tax loss in fiscal 2021 of $1.9 billion, and an incremental loss of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing of the transaction. Refer to Note 12.\n\nWe operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce, health and wellness, financial services, advertising, and data service businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality associates. We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, supply chain disruptions, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices,",

      "question": "How do COST, TGT, and WMT each structure their 401(k) plan contributions, and what does this reveal about their respective employee benefit strategies?",
      "answer": "COST indirectly references its 401(k) plan through its tax disclosures, noting that a portion of a special dividend was paid through the plan, resulting in a $94 discrete tax benefit in 2024. This suggests that the 401(k) plan plays a role in broader financial planning rather than being a central employee benefit. TGT explicitly states that it offers a 401(k) plan with dollar-for-dollar matching contributions up to five percent of eligible earnings, indicating a clear and competitive benefit strategy aimed at attracting and retaining talent. WMT provides a more detailed and structured approach, offering 100% matching contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings after one year of employment, with immediate vesting. This reveals that WMT places a strong emphasis on long-term employee retention and financial security. Collectively, the companies demonstrate varying degrees of emphasis on the 401(k) plan as a strategic component of employee compensation, with WMT showing the most robust commitment, TGT offering a competitive match, and COST treating the plan more as a financial instrument.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) emphasizes ongoing 'funding-the-growth' initiatives aimed at reducing costs across direct materials, logistics, and advertising, but acknowledges that these efforts may not fully offset rising commodity and service costs. The Coca-Cola Company (KO) notes that while productivity initiatives are a key lever to counter cost increases, they may not be sufficient to offset rising input costs in a timely or adequate manner. Mondelez International (MDLZ) provides concrete figures, indicating that in 2024, it spent $72 million on implementation costs tied to its 'Simplify to Grow' program, which includes supply chain reinvention and other productivity initiatives. While all three companies rely on productivity efforts to manage inflationary pressures, CL focuses on continuous cost reduction, KO expresses caution about the sufficiency of such efforts, and MDLZ demonstrates a more structured, quantified investment in operational restructuring.",

          "chunk_text": "In addition, as a result of our global shared service organizational model, certain of our functions, such as finance and accounting, customer service and logistics, human resources, global information technology and data analytics are concentrated in key office facilities. A significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason, including those mentioned above, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Volatility in material and other costs has in the past and may continue to adversely impact our profitability.\n\nRaw and packaging material commodities, such as resins, essential oils, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans, are subject to market price variations. Increases in the costs of and/or a reduction in the availability of commodities, energy (including fuel prices), logistics (including trucks and containers) or other necessary services, including as a result of geopolitical conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, and/or the impact of climatic events have affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our profit margins. While the prices of many commodities and services have retreated from their historical peaks, prices may increase again, which could create year-over-year inflationary pressure. We have taken and may continue to take actions to mitigate these cost increases in the form of price increases and efforts to achieve cost efficiencies in areas such as manufacturing and distribution, or otherwise manage the exposure through sourcing strategies, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. These actions may not, however, fully offset these higher costs and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely impacted. In addition, even if we are able to increase the prices of our products in response to commodity and other cost increases, we may not be able to sustain the price increases. If such price increases are sustained, they may negatively impact our sales volume, which can in turn negatively impact our margins and profitability. If competitors do not adjust their prices or if consumers decide not to pay higher prices and forego purchasing certain of our products or switch to 'private label' or lower-priced product offerings, sales declines, a deterioration in our profitability and loss of market share may occur which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See 'Our business results are impacted by our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain and/or key office facilities' above for additional information.\n\n## There is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful.\n\nOne way that we generate funds needed to support the growth of our business is through our continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization, which we refer to as our funding-the-growth initiatives. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect ex penses, distribution and logistics, and advertising and promotional materials, among other things. The achievement of our funding-the-growth goals depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unex pected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing any or all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our ex pected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our funding-the-growth initiatives, our ability to fund other initiatives and achieve our profitability goals may be adversely affected. Any failure to implement our funding-the-growth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding our funding-the-growth initiatives, refer to Part II, Item 7 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview.'\n\n## A cybersecurity incident, data breach or a failure of key technology systems could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely extensively on information and operational technology systems ('IT/OT Systems'), some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties, including cloud-based service providers, and their vendors, in order to conduct our business. Our uses of these systems include, but are not limited to:\n\n- communicating within our company and with other parties, including our customers, suppliers and consumers;\n- ordering and managing materials from suppliers;\n- converting materials to finished products;\n- receiving and processing orders from, shipping products to and invoicing our customers, suppliers and consumers;\n- marketing products to consumers;",

Furthermore, we may not be able to offset cost increases through productivity initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity.\n\n## If we do not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, or if we are unable to realize a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of our joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial results could suffer.\n\nWe routinely evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses or brands to expand our beverage portfolio and capabilities. Additionally, from time to time, we have acquired or taken control of bottling operations, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Acquisitions of businesses, brands or bottling operations may involve significant challenges and risks, and the expected benefits, including cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions, may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all.\n\nWe have encountered, and may in the future encounter, challenges in successfully integrating the operations, technologies, services, products and systems of any acquired businesses, brands or bottling partners in an effective, timely and cost-efficient manner. We have faced, and may in the future face, difficulties in operating through new business models and/or supply chain models, or in new categories or territories, and challenges in extending Company controls (including internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, data protection and cybersecurity), policies and governance structures (including with respect to food safety and quality, occupational safety and sustainability) to acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, which, at times, has resulted in increased costs and negative publicity. Our financial performance is impacted by how well we can integrate and manage our acquisitions, and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations. If we incur unforeseen liabilities or costs in connection with acquiring or integrating businesses, brands or bottling operations, experience internal control or product quality failures, or are unable to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, our consolidated results could be negatively affected.\n\nWe also participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures and strategic relationships. If we are unable to successfully manage our relationships with our joint venture partners or our strategic relationships, including our relationship with Monster, or if for any other reason we fail to realize all or a significant portion of the benefits we ex pect from our joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\n\n## If our third-party service providers and business partners do not satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, or experience adverse events, our business could suffer.\n\nIn the conduct of our business, we rely on relationships with third parties, including cloud data storage and other information technology service providers, suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other ex ternal business partners, for certain services in support of key portions of our operations. These third parties are subject to similar risks as we are relating to cybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems and employee failures, and are subject to legal, regulatory and market risks of their own. Our third-party service providers and business partners may not fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms or applicable laws. In addition, while we have procedures in place for assessing risk along with selecting, managing and monitoring our relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, cybersecurity, reputational and operational risk. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, or for any reason our third-party service providers or business partners fail to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities or ex perience events that could directly or indirectly impact us, our financial results could suffer.\n\n## If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or if we or our bottling partners experience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our business could suffer.\n\nMany of our employees at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we generally have been able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and regard our relations with employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory, negotiations may nevertheless be challenging, as the Company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our employees. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which could affect our profit margins. In addition, many of our bottling partners' employees are represented by labor unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or at our bottling operations or our major bottlers' plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers' ability to supply finished beverages to customers, which could reduce our net operating revenues and could expose us to customer claims. Furthermore, from time to time we and our bottling partners restructure manufacturing and other operations to improve productivity, which may have negative impacts on employee morale and work performance, result in escalation of grievances and adversely affect the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements.

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) highlights that failure to meet ESG goals or accurately report on them could harm its reputation, reduce consumer confidence, and expose the company to regulatory enforcement and litigation. KO specifically mentions the costs associated with complying with evolving ESG standards and the potential for increased legal exposure if goals are not met or are perceived to be unmet. PepsiCo (PEP) emphasizes its compliance with environmental laws and internal programs aimed at global environmental compliance. PEP states it is committed to making necessary expenditures to meet sustainability goals and comply with regulatory requirements, though it notes these have not had a material impact on its financial performance to date. Walmart (WMT) acknowledges that failure to meet ESG goals could adversely affect public perception, associate morale, and customer or investor support, and it discloses that it periodically updates ESG reporting on its corporate website. However, WMT does not quantify the financial impact of ESG compliance or failure to meet goals, focusing instead on reputational risk.

If we are unable to meet our ESG goals or evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, our reputation, and therefore our ability to sell products, could be negatively impacted. In addition, in recent years, investor advocacy groups and certain institutional investors have placed increasing importance on ESG matters. If, as a result of their assessment of our ESG practices, certain investors are unsatisfied with our actions or progress, they may reconsider their investment in our Company.\n\nAs the nature, scope and complexity of ESG reporting, diligence and disclosure requirements expand, we may have to undertake additional costs to control, assess and report on ESG metrics. Any failure or perceived failure, whether or not valid, to pursue or fulfill our ESG goals, targets and objectives or to satisfy various ESG reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could increase the risk of litigation.\n\nIncreasing concerns about the environmental impact of plastic bottles and other packaging materials could result in reduced demand for our beverage products and increased production and distribution costs.\n\nThere are increasing concerns among consumers, governments and other stakeholders about the damaging impact of the accumulation of plastic bottles and other packaging materials in the environment, particularly in the world's waterways, lakes and oceans, as well as inefficient use of resources when packaging materials are not included in a circular economy. We and our bottling partners sell certain of our beverage products in plastic bottles and use other packaging materials that, while largely recyclable, may not be regularly recovered and recycled due to low economic value or lack of collection and recycling infrastructure. If we and our bottling partners do not, or are perceived not to, act responsibly to address plastic materials recoverability and recycling concerns, our corporate image and brand reputation could be damaged, which may cause some consumers to reduce or discontinue consumption of some of our beverage products. In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments to reduce the Coca-Cola system's impact on the environment by increasing our use of recycled content in our packaging materials; increasing our use of packaging materials that are made in part of plant-based renewable materials; expanding our use of reusable packaging (including refillable or returnable glass and plastic bottles, as well as dispensed and fountain delivery models where consumers use refillable containers for our beverages); participating in programs and initiatives to reclaim or recover plastic bottles and other packaging materials that are already in the environment; and taking other actions and participating in other programs and initiatives organized or sponsored by nongovernmental organizations and other groups. If we and our bottling partners fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our announced environmental goals and commitments, the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference for our products. In addition, in response to environmental concerns, governmental entities in the United States and in many other jurisdictions around the world have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations and policies designed to mandate or encourage plastic packaging waste reduction and an increase in recycling rates and/or recycled content minimums, or, in some cases, restrict or even prohibit the use of certain plastic containers or packaging materials. These regulations and policies, whatever their scope or form, could increase the cost of our beverage products or otherwise put the Company at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, our increased focus on reducing plastic containers and other packaging materials waste may require us or our bottling partners to incur additional expenses and to increase our capital expenditures.

It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.\n\nWe are also subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater discharge and air emissions. In the United States, our facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated  onsite  and  sent  to  third-party  owned  and  operated  offsite  licensed  facilities  and  our  facilities outside  the  United  States  must  comply  with  similar  laws  and  regulations.  In  addition,  continuing  concern over  environmental,  social  and  governance  matters,  including  climate  change,  is  expected  to  continue  to result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in or outside of the United States) to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases, to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns or to expand mandatory reporting of certain environmental, social and governance metrics. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place with respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made, and plan  to  continue  making,  necessary  expenditures  for  compliance  with  applicable  environmental  laws  and regulations and to achieve our sustainability goals. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in environmental compliance requirements, and expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements or to achieve our sustainability goals, could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental remediation and indemnification obligations cannot be predicted with certainty, such obligations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.\n\nIn addition to the discussion in this section, see also 'Item 1A. Risk Factors.'\n\n## Human Capital\n\nPepsiCo  believes  that  human  capital  management,  including  attracting,  developing  and  retaining  a  high quality workforce, is critical to our long-term success. Our Board of Directors (Board) and its Committees provide  oversight  on  a  broad  range  of  human  capital  management  topics,  including  corporate  culture, diversity, equity and inclusion, pay equity, health and safety, training and development and compensation and benefits.\n\nWe employed approximately 309,000 people worldwide as of December 25, 2021, including approximately 129,000 people within  the  United  States. We  are  party  to  numerous  collective  bargaining  agreements  and believe that relations with our employees are generally good.\n\nProtecting the safety, health, and well-being of our associates around the world is PepsiCo's top priority. We strive to achieve an injury-free work environment. We also continue to invest in emerging technologies to protect our employees from injuries, including leveraging fleet telematics and distracted driving technology, resulting in reductions in road traffic accidents, and deploying wearable ergonomic risk reduction devices. In addition,  throughout  the  COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained focused on the health and safety of our associates, especially our frontline associates who continue to make, move and sell our products during this critical  time,  including  by  continuing  to  implement  various  safety  protocols  in  our  facilities,  providing personal protective equipment and enabling testing.",

The defendants in this derivative suit filed the opening brief on their motion to dismiss that case on December 21, 2021; and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022.\n\nThe Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims and the related opioid matters.\n\nWe discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" and in Note 10 in the \"Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements,\" which are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could increase the costs for our shareholders to bring claims, discourage our shareholders from bringing claims, or limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity.\n\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, associate or shareholder in such capacity or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery. The exclusive forum provision may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which they are intended to apply, then we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations. While the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with, and the exclusive forum provision will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under, the federal securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\n\n## Our reputation may be adversely affected if we are not able to achieve our ESG goals.\n\nWe strive to deliver shared value through our business and our diverse stakeholders expect us to make significant progress in certain ESG priority issue areas. From time to time, we announce certain aspirations and goals relevant to our priority ESG issues. We periodically publish information about our ESG priorities, strategies, and progress on our corporate website and update our ESG reporting from time to time. Achievement of these aspirations and goals is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, and it is possible that we may fail, or be perceived to have failed, in the achievement of our ESG goals or certain of our customers, associates, shareholders, investors, suppliers, business partners, government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations might not be satisfied with our efforts. Certain challenges we face in the achievement of our ESG objectives are also captured within our ESG reporting, which is not incorporated by reference into and does not form any part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A failure or perceived failure to meet our goals could adversely affect public perception of our business, associate morale or customer or shareholder support.\n\n## ITEM 1B.

      "question": "How do COST, MO, and PEP each assess the impact of evolving U.S. laws on their international operations, and what does this reveal about the varying degrees of regulatory exposure across their global footprints?",
      "answer": "COST highlights that it operates 276 warehouses outside the U.S. as of the end of 2024, and that international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign laws, including trade tariffs, monetary policies, and regulatory constraints, which could increase the cost and complexity of doing business globally. MO notes that while primarily U.S.-focused, it engages in international business activities subject to U.S. and foreign laws such as privacy laws and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, with compliance systems in place but no guarantee of full protection against violations. PEP emphasizes that its operations in developing and emerging markets like Brazil, China, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa are exposed to complex U.S. and foreign legal frameworks, including trade sanctions, foreign ownership restrictions, and anti-bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, which can significantly affect its ability to manage international operations. Synthesizing these perspectives reveals that while all three companies face regulatory exposure from U.S. laws, COST focuses on operational complexity, MO emphasizes compliance risk in limited international engagements, and PEP highlights structural legal and political risks in high-growth but unstable markets.",

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola (KO), Philip Morris (PM), and Walmart (WMT) each approach the determination of fair value for assets under different accounting contexts, and what do their methodologies reveal about the strategic importance and complexity of fair value estimation across the consumer staples sector?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) emphasizes the use of discounted cash flow models, market approaches, and management\u2019s assumptions consistent with a market participant perspective, particularly for impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at the reporting unit level. KO acknowledges the difficulty in predicting future cash flows, especially in emerging markets, and notes that different assumptions could materially affect impairment charges. Philip Morris (PM) uses a combination of income, cost, and market approaches in fair value determination for acquired assets, particularly in business combinations, and applies discounted cash flow models with the relief-from-royalty method for non-amortizable intangible assets. PM also highlights sensitivity to assumptions like revenue growth, discount rates, and terminal growth rates. Walmart (WMT), in contrast, determines the fair value of restricted stock units based on the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield over the vesting period, with specific percentages (e.g., 2.3% in fiscal 2023), reflecting a more straightforward, market-based valuation for compensation purposes. Together, these approaches show that fair value determination varies significantly across the sector depending on asset type, strategic context, and regulatory requirements.",

      "answer": "KO disclosed that 3,029 thousand Performance Share Units (PSUs) were certified with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $57.00 per unit for the 2020\u20132022 period, with 3,011 thousand released and 18 thousand forfeited in 2023. MDLZ reported annual grants of PSUs totaling 895,410 shares in 2023 with a weighted-average fair value of $68.59 per share, and cumulative balances of PSUs decreasing from 4,896,990 in 2021 to 4,553,166 by the end of 2023. PM disclosed that 2,854,560 shares may be issued upon vesting of PSUs if maximum performance targets are achieved, but did not provide annual grant or forfeiture details. These differences suggest varying levels of granularity and timing in how each company reports PSU activity and its financial implications.",

      "question": "How do MDLZ, TGT, and WMT each structure their performance share unit programs in terms of vesting timelines, payout assumptions, and grant date fair value metrics, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to equity-based compensation?",
      "answer": "MDLZ provides detailed historical data on performance share units, including annual grants (e.g., 895,410 units in 2023) and weighted-average fair value metrics (e.g., $68.59 per share in 2023), with vesting occurring over time as reflected in the balances and forfeitures. TGT specifies a 3- to 4-year performance period tied to metrics like sales growth and earnings per share, with grant date fair values of $162.54, $216.63, and $179.58 in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and assumes maximum payout rates in its disclosures. WMT outlines vesting schedules for equity awards, with performance share units generally vesting quarterly at 8% per quarter over three years starting in fiscal 2023, and uses discounted stock prices based on expected dividend yields (e.g., 2.2% in fiscal 2024) to determine fair value. Together, these disclosures reveal that MDLZ emphasizes historical grant and vesting data, TGT focuses on performance-based metrics relative to peers, and WMT structures compensation around service-based vesting with dividend-adjusted valuations.",

Mondel\u0113z includes Ukraine in its list of emerging markets within the Europe region and notes that the war in Ukraine has resulted in 'incremental costs' that are excluded in its Adjusted Operating Income calculations, though the exact financial impact is not quantified. PepsiCo highlights Ukraine as one of several international markets facing geopolitical tensions that have created challenging operating environments, but it does not isolate Ukraine-specific financial metrics. Taken together, Ukraine appears to be a minor market for Colgate, a partially acknowledged exposure for Mondel\u0113z, and one of many geopolitical concerns for PepsiCo, suggesting that none of the three companies have a major dependency on Ukraine, though all acknowledge its instability as a risk factor.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Executive Overview\n\n## Business Organization\n\nColgate-Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, 'we,' 'us,' 'our,' the 'Company' or 'Colgate') is a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet. We seek to deliver consistent compounded earnings per share growth to help drive superior total shareholder return, as well as to provide Colgate people with an innovative and inclusive work environment. We do this by developing and selling science-led products globally that make people's and their pets' lives healthier and more enjoyable and by embracing our Sustainability &amp; Social Impact Strategy across our organization.\n\nWe are tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, we follow a closely defined business strategy to grow our key product categories and increase our overall market share. Within the categories in which we compete, we prioritize our efforts based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization's core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable, profitable long-term growth.\n\nOperationally, we are organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. We compete in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to our sales and profitability. Approx imately two-thirds of our Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45% of our Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce our exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.\n\nThe Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment is managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell primarily to a variety of retailers, wholesalers, distributors, dentists and, in some geographies, skin health professionals. Through Hill's Pet Nutrition, we also compete on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling products principally through authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. We also sell certain of our products direct-to-consumer. We are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale and have major manufacturing facilities, warehousing facilities and distribution centers in every region around the world.\n\nIn connection with management changes, we realigned the reporting structure of our skin health business effective July 1, 2024. Accordingly, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the results of the skin health business previously reported within the Europe reportable operating segment are reported with our other skin health businesses in the North America reportable operating segment, with no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company has recast its historical geographic segment information to conform to the new reporting structure.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-GAAP financial measure, and gross profit margin, selling, general and administrative expenses, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, in each case, on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. In addition, we review market share, household penetration and other data to assess how our brands are performing within their categories on a global and regional basis. The monitoring of these indicators and our Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and the Company's use of market share data and the limitations of such data, see 'Non-GAAP Financial Measures' and 'Market Share Information' below.\n\n## The War in Ukraine\n\nThe war in Ukraine, and the related geopolitical tensions, have had and continue to have a significant impact on our operations in Ukraine and Russia, though it has not been material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have no manufacturing facilities in Russia. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our business in the Eurasia region constituted approximately 1% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 2% of our consolidated operating profit.",

We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and ev aluate our performance. We hav e detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below . The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition and div estiture activ ities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activ ities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activ ities and other major items affecting comparability of operating  results.  We  believ e  the  nonGAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We hav e prov ided the reconciliations between the GAAP  and  non-GAAP  financial  measures  along  with  a  discussion  of  our  underlying  GAAP  results  throughout  our Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.\n\nOur primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we ev aluate our current and prior year operating results. As new ev ents or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we prov ide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis . (1)\n\n- 'Organic Net Rev enue' is defined as net rev enues (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) excluding the impacts of acquisitions, div estitures , short-term distributor agreements related to the sale of a business , and currency rate fluctuations . We believ e that Organic net rev enue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activ ities of our business and prov ides improv ed comparability of results. We also evaluate Organic Net Rev enue growth from emerging markets and dev eloped markets, and these underlying measures are also reconciled to U.S. GAAP above. (2) (3) (4)\n- Our emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the AMEA region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, T\u00fcrkiye, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slov ak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries.\n- Our  dev eloped  markets  include  the  entire  North  America  region,  the  Europe  region  excluding  the  countries  included  in  the  emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region.\n- 'Adjusted Operating Income' is defined as operating income (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) excluding the impacts of the Simplify  to  Grow  Program ;  gains  or  losses  (including  non-cash  impairment  charges)  on  goodwill  and  intangible  assets;  div estiture or acquisition  gains  or  losses,  div estiture-related  costs , acquisition-related costs ,  and  acquisition  integration  costs  and  contingent consideration adjustments ;  inv entory step-up charges ; the operating results of div estitures ; operating results from short-term distributor agreements  related  to  the  sale  of  a  business ;  remeasurement  of  net  monetary  position ;  mark-to-market  impacts  from  commodity, forecasted currency and equity method inv estment transaction deriv ativ e contracts ; impact from resolution of tax matters ; 2017 malware incident net recov eries; incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine ; impact from the European Commission legal matter ; the impact from pension participation changes ; and operating costs from the ERP System Implementation program . We also present 'Adjusted Operating Income margin,' which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income. We also ev aluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis . We believ e these measures prov ide improv ed comparability of underlying operating results. (5) (2) (6) (7) (8) (9) (2) (3) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (4)\n- 'Adjusted  EPS'  is  defined  as  diluted  EPS  attributable  to  Mondel\u0113z  International  (the  most  comparable  U.S.  GAAP  financial  measure)  from continuing  operations  excluding  the  impacts  of  the  items  listed  in  the  Adjusted  Operating  Income  definition  as  well  as  losses  on  debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans; mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses and realized gains or losses from marketable securities ; initial impacts from enacted tax law changes ; and gains or losses on equity method inv estment transactions .

Many of the com m odities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open m arket. The prices we pay for such item s are subject to fluctuation, and we m anage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreem ents and derivative i n stru m en ts, i n cl u di n g  swaps an d f u tu res.

These  new  or  increased  legal  or  regulatory  requirem ents,  along  with  initiatives  to  m eet  our sustainability goals, could result in significant increased costs and additional investm ents in facilities and equipm ent.

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) reports that the Eurasia region accounted for approximately 2% of consolidated net sales and 3% of operating profit in 2023, noting continued risks including supply chain disruptions, foreign currency volatility, and challenges repatriating cash from Russia. Mondel\u0113z International (MDLZ) disclosed $143 million in direct expenses from the war in Ukraine in 2022, with partial recovery of $22 million later that year, and has partially reopened two damaged Ukrainian manufacturing plants. Philip Morris International (PM) states that Russia accounted for around 9% of total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume and 6% of total net revenues in 2023, with Ukraine contributing around 2% of shipment volume and 1% of net revenues, and highlights risks including potential asset nationalization, supply chain disruptions, and reputational consequences. Together, these companies show varying degrees of exposure and response, from MDLZ's physical asset impairment and partial recovery efforts, to PM's significant revenue exposure in Russia, to CL's more modest regional footprint but ongoing operational risks.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) emphasizes formal documentation and quarterly assessments of hedge effectiveness, and adopted ASU 2017-12 in 2019, which resulted in a $6 million increase in OCI (net of taxes) and a $24 million increase in long-term debt balances due to fair value hedge adjustments. Mondelez (MDLZ) uses a broad range of derivative instruments including currency forwards, commodity futures, and interest rate swaps, and highlights its requirement that forecasted transactions be 'probable' to qualify for hedge accounting, with unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges recorded in accumulated OCI. Altria (MO) focuses on mitigating foreign exchange risk through forwards, options, and swaps, and specifies that changes in fair value for cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated OCI and reclassified into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings, while also emphasizing that derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are marked to market through earnings. Collectively, these disclosures show that while all three companies use derivatives to manage financial risks, they differ in the scope of instruments used, documentation rigor, and the treatment of ineffective hedge components.",

          "chunk_text": "For derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at the inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures.\n\nThe Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to Note 16. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity rates or other financial indices. The Company does not view the fair values of its derivatives in isolation but rather in relation to the fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged transactions or other exposures. Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets.\n\nWe adopted ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , effective January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method. For highly effective cash flow hedges, this ASU requires the entire change in fair value of the hedging instrument included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to be recorded in other comprehensive income ('OCI'). No components of the Company's hedging instruments were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. To reflect the adoption of the new hedging standard on our cash flow hedging relationships at January 1, 2019, we recorded a $6 million increase, net of taxes, to the opening balance of reinvested earnings and a corresponding decrease to AOCI. For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, this ASU allows entities to elect to use the benchmark interest rate component of the contractual coupon cash flows to calculate the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. As a result of applying the new hedging standard to our fair value hedges on January 1, 2019, we recorded a $24 million increase to our hedged long-term debt balances, with a corresponding decrease to the opening balance of reinvested earnings of $18 million, net of taxes.\n\nThe following table presents the fair values of the Company's derivative instruments that were designated and qualified as part of a hedging relationship (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe use a combination of primarily currency forward contracts, futures, options and swaps; commodity forward contracts, futures and options; and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our asset derivatives is recorded within other current assets and other assets and the fair value of our liability derivatives is recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Non-cash changes in unrealized gains and losses related to our unsettled derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items, net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated, and those that are economic hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Currency movements related to our non-U.S. debt and our net investments in non-U.S. operations, as well as the related deferred taxes, are recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.\n\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.\n\nCommodity derivatives . We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nCurrency exchange derivatives . We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.\n- Depreciation, Amortization and Impairment Testing: Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical costs and depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years.\n\nAltria reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Altria performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Altria groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If Altria determines that an impairment exists, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. Altria also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.\n\nAltria conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require Altria to perform an interim review. Altria has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If necessary, Altria will perform a single step quantitative impairment test. Additionally, Altria has the option to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a reporting unit, but is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value in the period identified.\n\n- Derivative Financial Instruments: Altria enters into derivatives to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks, including foreign currency exchange rate risk. Altria uses various types of derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, options and swaps.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities. Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges at the inception of the contracts. For fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative, as well as the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item, are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings (losses) each period. For cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded each period in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) and are reclassified to the consolidated statements of earnings (losses) in the same periods in which operating results are affected by the respective hedged item. For net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign currency transaction gains or losses on a nonderivative hedging instrument are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. Such amounts remain in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the underlying foreign operations occurs for investments in foreign entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the respective hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, is expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated. Altria formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective, the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction and method for assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions, if it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge would no longer be considered effective and all of the derivative gains and losses would be recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings (losses) in the current period.\n\nFor financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments or do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings (losses) each period. Altria does not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n- Employee Benefit Plans: Altria provides a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits.

PepsiCo (PEP) combines lease and non-lease components for real estate leases, such as common-area maintenance. Target (TGT) combines lease and nonlease components for new and reassessed leases. While all three companies adopt similar high-level accounting treatments under ASC 842, their specific disclosures reveal differences in operational execution, particularly in how they handle non-lease elements like maintenance and variable payments.

          "chunk_text": "\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nWhen deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk. All derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid ex penses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The cash flow impact of the Company's derivative instruments is primarily included in our consolidated statement of cash flows in net cash provided by operating activities. Refer to Note 5.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at its inception based on whether or not the Company has the right to control the asset during the contract period and other facts and circumstances. We are the lessee in a lease contract when we obtain the right to control the asset. Operating lease right-of-use ('ROU') assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease and are included in the line items accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. When determining the lease term, we include renewal or termination options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in our consolidated statement of income. As the rates implicit in our leases are not readily determinable, we use our local incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. When our contracts contain lease and non-lease components, we account for both components as a single lease component. Refer to Note 10.\n\nWe have various contracts for certain fountain equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend economic life are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is recorded principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets, which are reviewed periodically and generally have the following ranges: buildings and improvements: 40 years or less; and machinery and equipment: 20 years or less. Land is not depreciated, and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term, including renewal options that we are reasonably certain to exercise, or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Depreciation is not recorded during the period in which a long-lived asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale, even if the asset or disposal group continues to generate revenue during the period. Depreciation expense, including the depreciation expense of assets under finance leases, totaled $997 million, $1,018 million and $1,125 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Amortization expense for leasehold improvements totaled $17 million, $14 million and $13 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.",

      "answer": "PepsiCo (PEP) applies the Monte Carlo Simulation Model to value long-term cash awards tied to total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a peer group over a three-year performance period. Procter & Gamble (PG) uses the same model specifically for performance stock units (PSUs), with assumptions closely aligned to those used for stock options. Philip Morris International (PM) utilizes the Monte Carlo Simulation Model for PSU awards subject to TSR-based performance metrics, with the model informing the grant date fair value. While all three companies rely on the Monte Carlo method for valuing performance-linked compensation, PEP focuses on cash-settled awards, PG aligns PSUs with option valuation practices, and PM integrates the model into TSR-based equity grants, reflecting nuanced differences in structure and application.",

Higher net pricing, which included the carryov er impact of pricing actions taken in 2023 as well as the effects of input cost-driv en pricing actions taken during 2024, was reflected across  all  regions.  T he  increase  in  input  costs  was  driv en  by  higher  raw  material  costs,  partially  offset  by  lower  manufacturing  costs  driv en  by productiv ity. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher cocoa, sugar, nuts and other ingredient costs, as well as unfav orable year-ov er-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower energy, edible oils, grains, dairy and packaging costs.  Ov erall, unfav orable v olume/mix was due to v olume declines partially offset by fav orable product mix. Unfav orable v olume/mix was experienced in all regions.\n\nT otal selling, general and administrativ e expenses decreased $563 million from 2023, which was net of benefits from a number of factors noted in the table abov e, including in part, fav orable contingent consideration adjustments related to the Clif Bar acquisition and lower acquisition integration costs, lapping prior-year div estiture-related costs, the elimination of costs from the dev eloped market gum business div ested in 2023, lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position, a fav orable currency translation impact related to expenses and lapping prior-year impact from the European Commission legal matter, marginally offset by costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program and higher implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow  program.  Excluding  these  factors,  selling,  general  and  administrativ e  expenses  increased  $215  million  from  2023.  T he  increase  was  driv en primarily  by  higher  adv ertising  and  consumer  promotion  costs  and  higher  ov erhead  costs  in  part  due  to  increased  inv estments  in  route  to  market capabilities.\n\nUnfavorable currency-related items, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, decreased operating income by $191 million primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relativ e to most currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Russian ruble, Brazilian real, Egyptian pound, T urkish lira, Chinese yuan and Nigerian naira, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relativ e to the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound sterling and Polish zloty.\n\nOperating income margin increased from 15.3% in 2023 to 17.4% in 2024. The increase in operating income margin was driv en primarily by fav orable year-ov er-year  change  in  acquisition  integration  costs  and  contingent  consideration  adjustments,  fav orable  year-ov er-year  change  in  mark-to-market gains/(losses) from commodity and currency hedging activ ities, higher Adjusted Operating Income margin, lower div estiture-related costs, lapping prioryear impact from the European Commission legal matter and lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position, partially offset by higher intangible asset impairment charges, lapping the prior-year gain and the impact from the dev eloped market gum business div ested in 2023 and costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program.

RISK FACTORS\n\nIn addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report, set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities. These risks, some of which have occurred and/or are occurring and any of which could occur in the future, are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.\n\n## Business and Industry Risks\n\nWe face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nWe operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately two-thirds of our Net sales originating in markets outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we face risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:\n\n- changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of inflationary pressure, economic slowdown or recession, the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, major developments in trade relations, volatile commodity prices and increases and/or volatility in the cost of raw and packaging materials, labor, energy and logistics;\n- changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows from non-U.S. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars, in those markets;\n- political instability or uncertainty, including as a result of elections, economic instability, geopolitical events and tensions, wars and military conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East and tensions between China and Taiwan;\n- changes to trade policies and agreements and other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of and/or the increase in trade restrictions and/or tariffs, sanctions, price controls, labor laws, travel or immigration restrictions, profit controls or other government controls, including as a result of the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East and tensions between China and Taiwan;\n- environmental events, widespread health emergencies, such as pandemics or epidemics, natural disasters or social or labor unrest;\n- exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import or ex port raw materials or finished product, including as a result of the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, or to repatriate earnings from overseas;\n- lack of well-established, reliable and/or impartial legal systems in certain countries where we operate and difficulties in enforcing contractual, intellectual property or other legal rights; and\n- foreign ownership and investment restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources.\n\nAny or all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix  from higher margin to lower margin product offerings.\n\nWe face risks resulting from political and macroeconomic instability and geopolitical events and tensions, such as the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East and tensions between China and Taiwan.

Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.\n\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores, clubs and eCommerce platforms around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our results of operations.\n\n## Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks\n\nOur international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.\n\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we operate retail and eCommerce businesses in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.\n\nDuring fiscal 2025, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions; legal and regulatory constraints, such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as in India; restrictive governmental actions, such as trade protection measures or nationalization; antitrust and competition law regulatory matters, such as those underway in Canada, Mexico and India (relating to our Flipkart subsidiary); local product safety and environmental laws; tax regulations; local labor laws; anti-money laundering laws and regulations; trade policies; foreign ex change or currency regulations; laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection; and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.\n\nChanging our operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade or newly imposed sanctions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and we may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. In addition, tensions between nation-state governments and conflicts of laws may lead to challenges for our operations. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response, or consumer boycotts in certain regions, could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could also adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they recur, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also ex ist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, geopolitical tensions or events, laws and regulations.\n\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or U.S. sanctions laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries. Our global policies designed to regulate such business practices and our global compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations may not be adequate to prevent the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are appropriately regulated by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could subject us to fines and penalties and adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.",

Short-term inv estments classified as av ailable-for-sale are recorded at fair v alue using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensiv e income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of av ailable-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded in interest income and other,  net  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income.  T hese  av ailable-for-sale  inv estments  hav e  a  low  lev el  of  inherent  credit  risk  giv en  they  are issued by the U.S. gov ernment and agencies. Changes in their fair v alue are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and market liquidity. Shortterm inv estments classified as held-to-maturity are financial instruments that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasured to fair v alue on a recurring basis.\n\nThe Company periodically ev aluates unrealized losses in its inv estment securities for credit impairment, using both qualitativ e and quantitativ e criteria. In the ev ent a security is deemed to be impaired as the result of a credit loss, the Company recognizes the loss in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair v alue. T he carrying v alue of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equiv alents, receiv ables and accounts payable, approximate fair v alue due to their short-term nature or v ariable interest rates. See Notes 2, 3,  and 4 for the carrying v alue and fair v alue of the Company's inv estments, deriv ativ e instruments, and fixed-rate debt.\n\nFair  v alue  is  defined  as  the  price  that  would  be  receiv ed  to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market participants at the measurement date. Fair v alue is estimated by applying a fair v alue hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observ able inputs when measuring fair v alue. The three lev els of inputs are:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in activ e markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\n- Level 2: Observ able market-based inputs or unobserv able inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n\nLevel 3: Significant unobserv able inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\n\nThe Company's valuation techniques used to measure the fair v alue of money market mutual funds, which are included in cash and cash equiv alents, are based on quoted market prices, such as quoted net asset v alues published by the fund as supported in an activ e market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair v alue of all other non-deriv ativ e financial instruments are based on independent external v aluation information. T he pricing process uses  data  from  a  v ariety  of  independent  external  v aluation  information  prov iders,  including  trades,  bid  price  or  spread,  two-sided  markets,  quotes, benchmark curves including but not limited to treasury benchmarks, Secured Ov ernight Financing Rate and swap curv es, discount rates, and market data feeds.

Long-term financial liabilities include the Company's long-term debt, which are recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs. Discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense ov er the term of the loan.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. In most instances, we must use a particular accounting policy or method because it is the only one that is permitted under U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires that we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses, as well  as  our  disclosure  of  contingencies.  If  actual  amounts  differ  from  previous  estimates,  we  include  the  revisions  in  our  consolidated  results  of operations in the period during which we know the actual amounts. Historically, aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our Audit &amp; Risk Committee. The following is a discussion of the more significant assumptions, estimates, accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\n\nAcquisitions PMI accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. PMI allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date with the excess recorded as G oodwill. The fair value of the applicable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is determined through established valuation techniques, such as the income, cost or market approach. PMI may utilize third-party valuation ex perts to assist in the fair value determination of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The determination of fair value requires management to make judgements and may involve the use of significant estimates, including assumptions with respect to estimated projected revenue growth, future cash flows, terminal growth rates, useful economic lives of intangible assets acquired, discount rates, royalty rates and other factors. Certain acquired intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and PMI's intent to continue to support and build the intangible.\n\nAlthough PMI believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates. Changes in assumptions related to future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.\n\nSee Item 8, Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements for details of the critical accounting estimates relevant to the business combinations in the periods presented in this Form 10-K.",

          "chunk_text": "## Promotional and Marketing Programs\n\nIn addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities, we may provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds to our bottlers. In most cases, we do this on a discretionary basis under the terms of commitment letters or agreements, even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottler's agreements between our Company and the bottlers. Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce new products, packages and equipment to assist the bottlers. Likewise, in many instances, we provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to fountain and bottle/can retailers, typically pursuant to marketing agreements.\n\n## Investments in Bottling Operations\n\nMost of our branded beverage products are prepared, packaged, distributed and sold by independent bottling partners. However, from time to time we acquire or take control of a bottling operation, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning a bottling operation enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler's sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler's business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. In line with our long-term bottling strategy, we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation, typically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-Cola system efficiency. When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an equity method investment, our Company continues to participate in the bottler's results of operations through our share of the equity method investee's earnings or losses.\n\nIn addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in certain bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca-Cola system's production, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net operating revenues and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generate increased sales for our Company's concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler's operating and financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nSales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters historically accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. These include companies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; dilutables (including syrups and powders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-based beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and relaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. The Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States. In the United States, the Company has established a wholly owned, indirect, firewalled subsidiary, which uses third-party manufacturers and distributors to produce and sell alcohol products in certain regions of the United States and also authorizes alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage bases. Competitive products include all alcohol ready-to-drink beverages containing various alcohol bases. In many of the countries in which we do business, PepsiCo, Inc. is a primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone S.A., Suntory Beverage &amp; Food Limited, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Kirin Holdings, Heineken N.V., Diageo plc and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, increasingly, against smaller companies that are developing microbrands and selling them directly to consumers through e-commerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete against retailers that have developed their own store or private-label beverage brands.\n\nCompetitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs,     in-store displays and point-of-sale marketing, digital marketing, product and ingredient innovation, availability, increased efficiency in production techniques, the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing equipment, contracting with marketing assets (theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc.), and brand and trademark development and protection.",

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola (KO), Target (TGT), and Walmart (WMT) compare in terms of their operational presence in Georgia, and what does this reveal about their relative focus on this market within the broader southeastern U.S. retail and consumer staples landscape?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, indicating a strategic corporate presence in the state. Target (TGT) operates 51 stores in Georgia, with 6,826 thousand square feet of retail space. Walmart (WMT) has a significantly larger footprint with 215 total locations in Georgia, including 154 Supercenters, 35 Neighborhood Markets, and 24 Sam's Clubs, occupying a substantial portion of its 783,347 thousand total U.S. square feet. This suggests that while all three companies operate in Georgia, Walmart maintains the strongest retail presence, Target has a moderate but sizeable footprint, and Coca-Cola\u2019s presence is more corporate and brand-centric rather than retail-focused.",

      "answer": "KO emphasizes its strict counterparty credit guidelines and collateral provisions in the event of a credit rating downgrade, ensuring minimal counterparty risk through investment-grade requirements and netting agreements. MDLZ highlights that a credit rating downgrade could significantly increase borrowing costs and constrain access to commercial paper markets, which are crucial for its short-term financing needs. MO warns that a credit downgrade, particularly to below investment grade, could severely impair its ability to access capital markets and increase financing costs, especially during periods of high liquidity demand such as MSA payments. Collectively, the companies show varying degrees of sensitivity to credit rating changes, with KO focusing on counterparty risk management, MDLZ on commercial paper access, and MO on broader capital market constraints.",

          "chunk_text": "## Credit Risk Associated with Derivatives\n\nWe have established strict counterparty credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions of investment grade or better. We monitor counterparty exposures regularly and review any downgrade in credit rating immediately. If a downgrade in the credit rating of a counterparty were to occur, we have provisions requiring collateral for substantially all of our transactions. To mitigate presettlement risk, minimum credit standards become more stringent as the duration of the derivative financial instrument increases. In addition, the Company's master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the Company to net settle for transactions with the same counterparty. To minimize the concentration of credit risk, we enter into derivative transactions with a portfolio of financial institutions. Furthermore, for certain derivative financial instruments, the Company has agreements with counterparties that require collateral to be exchanged based on changes in the fair value of the instruments. The Company classifies collateral payments and receipts as investing cash flows when the collateral account is in an asset position and as financing cash flows when the collateral account is in a liability position. As a result of these factors, we consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedging Strategy\n\nThe Company uses cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. The changes in fair values of hedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings. The maximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is typically three years.\n\nThe Company maintains a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our U.S. dollar net cash inflows from sales outside the United States and U.S. dollar net cash outflows from procurement activities will be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into forward contracts and purchase foreign currency options and collars (principally euro, British pound and Japanese yen) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign currencies, the decline in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by gains in the fair value of the derivative instruments. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by losses in the fair value of the derivative instruments. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for the Company's foreign currency cash flow hedging program were $9,206 million and $9,408 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nThe Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of its foreign currency denominated debt and other monetary assets or liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency ex change rates. For this hedging program, the Company recognizes in earnings each period the changes in carrying values of these foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in exchange rates. The changes in fair values of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the changes in fair values attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges for the Company's foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities were $557 million and $958 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nThe Company has entered into commodity futures contracts and other derivative instruments on various commodities to mitigate the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of materials used in our manufacturing process. These derivative instruments were designated as part of the Company's commodity cash flow hedging program. The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with future purchases of certain commodities. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for this program were $58 million and $54 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nOur Company monitors our mix of short-term debt and long-term debt regularly. We manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative financial instruments. From time to time, the Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements and has designated these instruments as part of the Company's interest rate cash flow hedging program. The objective of this hedging program is to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in benchmark interest rates on the Company's future interest payments. The total notional value of derivatives that were designated and qualified for the Company's interest rate cash flow hedging program was $750 million as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, we did not have any interest rate swaps designated as a cash flow hedge.",

In addition, local economies, monetary policies and currency hedging av ailability affect our ability to hedge against currency-related economic losses. We might not be able to successfully mitigate  our  exposure  to  currency  risks  due  to  factors  such  as  continued  global  and  local  market  v olatility,  actions  by  foreign  gov ernments,  trade disputes,  economic  sanctions,  political  uncertainty,  inflation,  interest  rates  and  limited  hedging  opportunities.  For  instance,  in  December  2023,  the Argentinean peso devalued significantly in excess of historic lev els. Accordingly, changes in the currency exchange rates that we use to translate our results  into  U.S.  dollars  for  financial  reporting  purposes  or  for  transactions  inv olv ing  multiple  currencies  could  materially  and  adv ersely  affect  future demand for our products, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees in the short or long-term.\n\nWeak financial performance, downgrades in our credit ratings, illiquid global capital markets and volatile global economic conditions could limit our access to short-term financing, reduce our liquidity and/or increase our borrowing costs.\n\nWe regularly access the commercial paper markets in the United States and Europe for ongoing funding requirements. A downgrade in our credit ratings by  a  credit  rating  agency  could  increase  our  borrowing  costs  and  adv ersely  affect  our  ability  to  issue  commercial  paper.  Disruptions  in  the  global commercial paper market or other effects of v olatile economic conditions on the global credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short- and long-term debt offerings. Additionally, we use cash management programs, such as  factoring  and  supply  chain  finance  arrangements,  in  our  business  when  circumstances  are  fav orable  to  manage  liquidity.  If  these  programs  or underlying customer or supplier terms do not continue and we are unable to secure alternativ e programs, our cash and working capital may be negativ ely affected  and  we  may  hav e  to  utilize  our  v arious  financing  arrangements  or  increase  our  long-term  borrowings  for  short-  and  long-term  liquidity requirements. Limitations on our ability to access the commercial paper markets, a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs could materially and adv ersely affect our financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\n\nVolatility in the global capital markets, interest rates, inflation rates, our participation in multiemployer pension plans and other factors could increase our costs relating to our employees' pensions.\n\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for a number of our employees throughout the world and also contribute to other employees' pensions under defined benefit plans that we do not sponsor. At the end of 2024, the projected benefit obligation of the defined benefit pension plans we sponsor was $7.9 billion and plan assets were $8.5 billion.\n\nFor defined benefit pension plans that we maintain, the difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plans, significantly affects  the  net  periodic  benefit  costs  of  our  pension  plans  and  the  ongoing  funding  requirements  of  those  plans.  Our  largest  funded  defined  benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets inv ested in a globally div ersified portfolio of inv estments, including equities and corporate and gov ernment debt. Among other factors, changes in interest rates, inflation rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, inv estment returns, funding requirements in the jurisdictions in which the plans operate and the market v alue of plan assets affect the lev el of plan funding, cause v olatility in the net periodic pension cost and impact our future funding requirements. Legislativ e and other gov ernmental regulatory actions may also increase funding requirements for our pension  plan  benefit  obligations.  Volatility  in  the  global  capital  markets  may  increase  the  risk  that  we  will  be  required  to  make  additional  cash contributions to these company-sponsored pension plans and recognize further increases in our net periodic pension cost.\n\nWe also participate  in  multiemployer  pension  plans  for  certain  U.S.  union-represented  employees. As  a  participating  employer  under  multiemployer pension plans, we may owe more than the contributions we are required to make under the applicable collectiv e bargaining agreements. For example, if we partially or completely withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan, we may be required to pay a partial or complete withdrawal liability, such as the withdrawal liability we are paying in connection with our complete withdrawal from the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund in 2018. This kind of withdrawal liability will generally increase if there is also a mass withdrawal of other participating employers or if the plan terminates. See Note 11, Benefit Plans , to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our multiemployer pension plans.\n\nA significant increase in our pension benefit obligations, future funding requirements or net periodic benefit costs could curtail our ability to inv est in the business and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.",

These additional laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition by increasing our compliance and manufacturing costs and creating legal and reputational risk if we are unable to, or are perceived not to, satisfy such requirements.\n\n## Capital Markets and Financing Risks\n\n## Disruption and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets could materially adversely affect our business.\n\nAccess to the credit and capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs. We typically access the commercial paper market in the second quarter to help fund payments under the Master Settlement Agreement (the 'MSA'), tax obligations and shareholder dividends. Disruption and uncertainty in the credit or capital markets or high interest rates could negatively impact the availability or cost of capital and adversely affect our liquidity, cash flow, earnings and dividend rate. In addition, tighter credit markets could lead to business disruptions for our suppliers and service providers, which could, in turn, materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## A downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely impact our borrowing costs and access to credit and capital markets, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\n\nRating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions, the impact of strategic transactions and our financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the state of the economy and our industry. Any downgrade or announcement that we are under review for a potential downgrade of our credit ratings, as occurred following our former investment in JUUL, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, could increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access the credit and capital markets, including the commercial paper market, on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all or result in a reduction in our liquidity, requiring us to rely on more expensive types of financing. Any such outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\n\n## Our performance relating to corporate responsibility matters and investor and stakeholder responses thereto may impact our reputation, ability to attract investors and the market value of our stock.\n\nThere has been a heightened focus from investors and other stakeholders on corporate responsibility, including with respect to environmental, social and governance matters. In response, there has been an increase in third-party providers of assessments and ratings to satisfy investor demand for measurement of corporate responsibility performance, and the criteria by which these third parties measure such performance may vary or change over time. Furthermore we have published reports concerning our goals, approach and progress with respect to a range of corporate responsibility focus areas. Investors may use these non-financial performance factors and reports to guide investment strategies, and investor and other stakeholder expectations of and responses to our policies, actions, goals and disclosures concerning corporate responsibility matters may evolve over time. Investors may choose not to invest in us if their policies prevent them from investing in tobacco companies and may base investment and other decisions on their view of our policies, actions, goals or disclosures with respect to corporate responsibility matters.\n\nThere is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, trade customers, consumers, our employees and others, on environmental, social and governance matters. Despite our efforts, any failure to achieve our corporate responsibility goals, including those aimed at reducing the harm associated with our companies' products and our underage tobacco prevention goals, could result in adverse publicity. Furthermore, if investors or other stakeholders view our corporate responsibility policies, actions, goals or disclosures as insufficient or otherwise unacceptable, we could incur negative publicity and litigation challenges. These outcomes could materially adversely affect our businesses and reputation and impair our ability to attract and retain investors, which could have a material negative impact on the market value of our stock.\n\n## Information Technology and Data Privacy Risks\n\n## The failure of our, or our service providers', key suppliers' or trade customers', information systems to function as intended, or cyber-attacks or security breaches, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\nWe rely extensively on information technology, much of which is managed by third-party service providers (such as cloud data service providers), to support a variety of business processes and activities, including: complying with regulatory, legal, financial reporting and tax  requirements; engaging in marketing and ecommerce activities; managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations; researching, developing, manufacturing and distributing our products; collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information; and communicating with employees, investors, suppliers, trade customers, adult tobacco consumers and others. Our suppliers, supply chain service providers and trade customers also rely extensively on information systems. We are also increasing the frequency and scale of new technology and systems deployment both directly and through third parties.\n\nWe continue to make appropriate investments in administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect our information systems and data from cyber-threats, including human error and malicious acts. Our safeguards include employee training, testing and auditing",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive uses the Monte Carlo simulation model specifically for performance-based restricted stock units that include a total shareholder return modifier, which is considered a market condition. Mondelez applies the Monte Carlo model to determine the grant date fair value of performance share units, particularly for the market-based total shareholder return component, while also adjusting compensation expense based on the probability of achieving performance conditions. PepsiCo utilizes the Monte Carlo simulation model to mark-to-market long-term cash awards that qualify as liability awards under share-based compensation guidance. Together, these approaches show that while all three companies rely on Monte Carlo simulations for market-based components, they apply the model differently depending on the structure of their compensation plans and the nature of the awards.",

The Company's derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. For fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative, as well as the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item, are recognized in earnings each period. For cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings when the offsetting effect of the hedged item is also recognized in earnings. For hedges of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. Cash flows related to hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged item in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nThe Company may also enter into certain foreign currency and interest rate instruments that economically hedge certain of its risks but do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in fair value of these derivative instruments, based on quoted market prices, are recognized in earnings each period. The Company's derivative instruments and other financial instruments are more fully described in Note 7, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments along with the related fair value measurement considerations.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units (both performance-based and time-vested), based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant over the requisite service period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton ('Black-Scholes') option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. In addition to performance conditions, performance-based restricted stock units also include a total shareholder return modifier. Because the total shareholder return modifier is considered a market condition, the Company uses a Monte-Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units. The fair value of time-vested restricted stock units is determined based on the closing market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant. Stock-based compensation plans, related expenses and assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are more fully described in Note 8, Capital Stock and Stock-Based Compensation Plans.\n\n## Currency Translation\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other than those operating in highly inflationary environments, are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.\n\nFor subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, local currency-denominated non-monetary assets, including inventories, goodwill and property, plant and equipment, are remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while local currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company.",

Deferred stock units are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. Deferred stock units generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. Performance share units granted under our 2005 Plan vest based on varying performance, market and service conditions. The unvested performance share units have no voting rights and do not pay dividends. Dividend equivalents accumulated over the vesting period are paid only after the performance share units vest.\n\nThe fair value of the deferred stock units, performance share units and other stock-based awards at the date of grant is amortized to earnings over the vesting period. The fair value of our deferred stock units and other stock-based awards is measured at the market price of our Common Stock on the grant date. Performance share unit awards generally have targets tied to both performance and market-based conditions. For market condition components, market volatility and other factors are taken into consideration in determining the grant date fair value and the related compensation expense is recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided. For performance condition components, we estimate the probability that the performance conditions will be achieved each quarter and adjust compensation expenses accordingly. The grant date fair value of performance share units is determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation model for the market-based total shareholder return component and the market price of our Common Stock on the grant date for performance-based components.

We and our bottling partners may not be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers, and our contingency plans may not be effective in preventing disruptions that may arise from shortages of any ingredients or other raw materials. Furthermore, some of our suppliers are located in countries experiencing political instability or other risks and/or unfavorable economic conditions. In addition, adverse and extreme weather conditions may affect the supply of agricultural commodities from which key ingredients for our products are derived. Any sustained or significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe and our independent bottlers operate a large fleet of trucks and other motor vehicles to distribute beverage products to customers. In addition, we and our independent bottlers use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources to operate production plants, bottling plants and distribution facilities. Increases in energy demand have in the past resulted, and could in the future result, in higher energy prices, impacting us and our independent bottlers.\n\nThe raw materials and other supplies, including ingredients, agricultural commodities, energy, fuel, packaging materials, transportation, labor and other supply chain inputs that we use for the production and distribution of our products, are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors. These factors include changes in supply and demand; supplier capacity constraints; a deterioration of our or our bottling partners' relationships with suppliers; international conflicts; political uncertainties; acts of terrorism; governmental instability; inflation; weather conditions (including the effects of climate change); hurricanes, wildfires, floods, droughts and other natural disasters; disease or pests (including the impact of citrus greening disease on the citrus industry); agricultural uncertainty; health epidemics, pandemics or other contagious outbreaks; cattle disease outbreaks (including avian flu); labor shortages, strikes or work stoppages; changes in or the enactment of new laws and regulations; governmental actions or controls or import/export restrictions, such as new, expanded or retaliatory tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers; port congestion or delays; transport capacity constraints; cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions; or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market, and the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation. We expect the inflationary pressures on certain input and other costs to continue to impact our business in 2025.\n\nOur attempts to offset cost pressures, such as through price increases of some of our products, may not be successful. Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forgo some purchases altogether. To the extent",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\n\nAs we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our ov erall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adv erse effects that the v olatility of these markets may hav e on our operating results.\n\nWe principally utilize deriv ativ e instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from v olatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our deriv ativ e activ ity and the types of deriv ativ e instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 10, Financial Instruments .\n\nMany of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create v olatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the  U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated  reporting  generally  results  in  a  cumulativ e  translation  adjustment  to  other  comprehensiv e  income  within  equity. A  stronger  U.S.  dollar relativ e to other functional currencies adv ersely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate v olatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Operations by Operating Segment under Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results for  currency  exchange  effects  on  our  financial  results.  T hroughout  our  discussion  and  analysis  of  results,  we  isolate  currency  impacts  and supplementally prov ide net rev enues, operating income and diluted earnings per share on a constant currency basis. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, recent currency dev aluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting .\n\nWe also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather  conditions,  gov ernment  policy  and  regulation  and  the  macroeconomic  env ironment.  Refer  to Recent  Developments  and  Significant  Items Affecting Comparability and Financial Outlook above for updates on recent supply chain, labor and other disruptions that are increasing operating costs and  impacting  our  results.  T o  manage  input  cost  v olatility  and  inflation,  we  enter  into  forward  purchase  agreements  and  other  deriv ativ e  financial instruments. We also pursue productiv ity and cost sav ing measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings.\n\nWe regularly ev aluate our v ariable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures  include  mov ements  in  U.S.  T reasury  rates,  corporate  credit  spreads,  commercial  paper  rates  as  well  as  limited  debt  tied  to  Secured Overnight  Financing  Rates  ('SOFR').  We  periodically  use  interest  rate  swaps  and  forward  interest  rate  contracts  to  achiev e  a  desired  proportion  of variable  v ersus  fixed-rate  debt  based  on  current  and  projected  market  conditions.  For  more  information  on  our  debt  activ ity,  see  Note  9, Debt  and Borrowing Arrangements .\n\nSee Note 10, Financial Instruments , for more information on our deriv ativ e activ ity.\n\n## Value at Risk\n\nWe use a value at risk ('VAR') computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair v alue of our interest rate-sensitiv e financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitiv e deriv ativ e financial instruments. T he VAR analysis was done separately as of each quarter end for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios using historical market mov ements. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receiv ables, and net inv estments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the abov e-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.",

In addition, our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct-to-consum er e-com m erce capabilities.\n\nThe retail industry is also im pacted by the actions and increasing power of retailers, including as a result of increased consolidation of ownership resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, particularly in North Am erica, Europe and Latin Am erica. In this changing retail landscape, retailers and buying groups have im pacted and m ay continue to im pact our ability to com pete in these jurisdictions by demanding lower prices or increased prom otional program s, rem oving our products or otherwise reducing shelf space allocated to our products and focusing on introducing and developing private-label brands.

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) highlights that international conflicts such as those in Ukraine and the Middle East have led to increased regulatory scrutiny, export controls, and sanctions that could disrupt operations and increase input costs. PepsiCo (PEP) echoes similar concerns, noting that geopolitical conflicts and regulatory changes\u2014especially in emerging markets like Russia and China\u2014pose significant risks to its international operations, including sanctions, import/export restrictions, and currency controls. In contrast, Mondelez (MDLZ) does not explicitly detail regulatory risks in the provided evidence but broadly references that risks and uncertainties, including those outlined in its SEC filings, could materially affect its results. This suggests that while KO and PEP are actively identifying and disclosing specific regulatory risks in international markets, MDLZ appears to take a more generalized approach to regulatory compliance and risk disclosure.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Commodity Trends\n\nWe regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectiv ely secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. During 2024, the primary driv ers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher cocoa, sugar, nuts and other ingredient costs as well as unfav orable year-ov er-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower energy, edible oils, grains, dairy and packaging costs. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, generally we believ e there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will broadly remain av ailable.\n\nA number of external factors such as the current macroeconomic env ironment, including global inflation, effects of geopolitical uncertainty, climate and weather  conditions,  commodity,  transportation  and  labor  market  conditions,  exchange  rate  v olatility  and  the  effects  of  local  and  global  regulations, including trade policies, gov ernmental agricultural or other programs affect the av ailability and cost of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products.  In  particular ,  the  supply  of  cocoa  is  exposed  to  many  of  these  factors,  including  climate  change  and  weather  ev ents,  local  regulations  in cocoa-producing countries, and global regulations such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (which requires companies to ensure that the products they place on the EU market or export from it are not associated with deforestation). T hese factors could impact the supply of cocoa, which could potentially limit our ability to produce our products and significantly impact profitability.\n\nDuring 2024, price v olatility and the higher aggregate cost env ironment increased due to international supply chain and labor market disruptions and generally  higher  commodity,  transportation  and  labor  costs.  We  expect  these  conditions  to  continue  to  impact  our  aggregate  commodity  costs.  In particular, we expect to face higher cocoa costs in the near- and medium-term due to these factors. For example, the market price for cocoa beans on the Intercontinental Exchange in London was 161% higher on the last trading day of the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the same day in the fourth quarter of 2023 and it is likely that prices will remain elev ated for some time. It is possible that we may not be able to increase prices sufficiently to fully cover the incremental costs of cocoa prices in this env ironment and/or our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in cocoa costs, which could result in a significant impact on our profitability.\n\nWe address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and ov erhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; howev er, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, such as dairy, where there is a limited ability to hedge, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Our commodity procurement practices are intended to mitigate price v olatility and prov ide v isibility to future costs, but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible future price decreases. Additionally, our costs for major raw materials will not necessarily reflect market  price  fluctuations  because  of  our  forward  purchasing  and  hedging  practices.  Due  to  competitiv e  or  market  conditions,  planned  trade  or promotional incentiv es, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily.",

Based on our m ost recent assessm ent of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low .

The anticipated increase is primarily due to higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses of $45 million, coupled with higher service cost of $17 million, partially offset by higher expected return on assets of $20 million, coupled with lower interest cost of $30 million and other movements of $4 million.\n\nWeighted-average expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans. A fifty-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2025 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $56 million, and a fifty-basispoint increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2025 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $46 million. Similarly, a fifty-basis-point decrease (increase) in the ex pected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) our 2025 pension expense by approximately $44 million.\n\nIncome T axes Income tax provisions for jurisdictions outside the United States, as well as state and local income tax provisions, are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax  audits. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes, we evaluate potential tax exposures and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax  liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to ex pense would generally result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax  benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n\nWe are required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income. If we determine, using all available evidence, that we do not reach the more likely than not threshold for recovery, a valuation allowance is recorded.  Significant judgment is required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets including estimates of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions and the feasibility of on-going tax planning strategies, as applicable.\n\nThe effective tax rates used for interim reporting are based on our full-year geographic earnings mix projections. Changes in currency exchange rates, earnings mix by taxing  jurisdiction  or  future  regulatory  developments  may  have  an  impact  on  the  effective  tax   rates. Significant  judgment  is  required  in  determining  income  tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.\n\nFor further details, see Item 8, Note 12. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nHedging As discussed below in 'Market Risk,' we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures. For derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings. For our other derivatives to which we have elected to apply hedge accounting, gains and losses on these derivatives are initially deferred in accumulated other",

In addition, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nNew or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements, or more restrictive interpretations of ex isting requirements, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, from time to time, various regulatory authorities around the world review the use of various ingredients and packaging content in consumer products. While we monitor and seek to mitigate the impact of any emerging information, a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that any ingredient or packaging content in our products should be restricted or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business and reputation, as could negative reactions by our consumers, trade customers or non-governmental organizations to our current or prior use of such ingredients or packaging. Additionally, an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients, to obtain regulatory approval of such products or ingredients on a timely basis or to effectively market and sell such products could likewise adversely affect our business.\n\nBecause of our extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of worldwide anti-bribery laws, including those that prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and laws that prohibit commercial bribery.

Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWhile it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, findings that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations have subjected us to, and could subject us to, civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the cost of responding to such a claim, including management time and out-ofpocket expenses, and the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation, brand image and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For information regarding our legal and regulatory matters, see Item 3 'Legal Proceedings' and Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Legal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our business.\n\nAs a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories, we are and may continue to be subject to a wide variety of legal claims and proceedings, including disputes relating to intellectual property, contracts, product liability, marketing, advertising, foreign ex change controls, antitrust and trade regulation, as well as labor and employment, pension, data privacy and security, environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions. Regardless of their merit, these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend. Since litigation is inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection therewith, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. In addition, if one of our products, or an ingredient contained in our products, is perceived or found to be defective, or unsafe or have a quality issue, we have had to and may in the future need to withdraw, recall or reformulate some of our products. Whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful, or a withdrawal, recall or reformulation is required or advisable, such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image. The resolution of, or increase in the reserves taken in connection with, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for that period. See Item 3 'Legal Proceedings' and Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedings.",

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein is included in the section titled \"Economic Conditions and Uncertainties\" and the section titled \"Risk Factors\" (Part I, Item 1A) of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Purpose, Approach and Non-GAAP Measures\n\nThe purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A) is to provide an understanding of Procter &amp; G amble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year.

Certain impacts of physical risk may include: temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers; ex treme weather patterns that affect the production or sourcing of certain commodities; flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory; disruption of electrical grids or utilities required to operate our stores, clubs and information systems; and heat and extreme weather events that cause long-term disruption or threats to the habitability of the communities in which we operate. Relative to transition risk, certain impacts may include: changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate-related weather events; prolonged climate-related events affecting macroeconomic conditions with related effects on consumer spending and confidence; stakeholder perception of our engagement in climate-related policies; and new regulatory requirements resulting in higher compliance risk and operational costs.\n\nWe bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers; theft, loss or spoilage of inventory; and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Moreover, our operations in the U.S. comprise a significant portion of our financial and operational performance. Therefore, any of the above matters that uniquely impact or are specifically concentrated in the U.S. could materially adversely affect our financial and operational performance.\n\n## Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner and in the large volumes we may demand, are significant challenges, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.\n\nPolitical and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances (such as we previously experienced (and could experience again) with the pandemic recovery related challenges, including supply chain disruption and production, labor shortages and increases in labor costs) in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located or regions goods are transported from or through, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers not having the financial ability or capacity to fulfill their indemnification obligations to us if called upon, thereby ex posing us to the full cost of risks and claims, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, ex treme weather events impacting the growing, manufacturing, mining and harvesting of commodities and products, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs and other facilities, including as a result of ex treme weather or labor slowdowns and/or strikes at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.\n\nIn addition, U.S. and international trade policies, tariffs, trade barriers and other restrictions on the ex portation and importation of goods, trade sanctions imposed between certain countries and entities, the limitation on the ex portation or importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers, our access to products and our access to service providers (such as transportation and logistics providers) could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\n\nIf the quality or safety of products w e sell in stores or online fails to meet our customers' expectations or regulatory standards, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries caused by a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance.\n\nOur customers count on us to provide them with quality products at an affordable price. Occasionally, the quality of products that we source from our suppliers fails to meet customer expectations. In many cases, these products are subject to regulatory action or recall. For general merchandise, this could be because the product fails to meet safety standards. For food products, it could be because the product is a source of foodborne illness. For health and wellness products, it could be because the product does not produce the expected result for the customer or harms the customer. Any of these factors could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to choose to buy products from a different retailer, even if the quality issue is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. When a",

      "question": "How do Colgate-Palmolive's exposure to consumer switching, Costco's reliance on private label as part of its value proposition, and Mondelez's pricing challenges interact to shape their respective risks and strategies around private label product competition in the consumer staples sector?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) identifies private label products as a risk due to consumers switching during economic uncertainty, which could reduce demand for its premium offerings and shift product mix toward lower-priced alternatives. Costco (COST) actively incorporates private label products as a core part of its business model, offering a limited selection of both national and private-label products to drive high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover at lower gross margins. Mondelez (MDLZ) faces the risk that increased private label competition could lead to customer delistings or pressure to lower prices, which would impact its margins and revenue, especially when input costs are volatile. Together, these perspectives reveal that while COST leverages private label as a strategic advantage, CL and MDLZ view it as a competitive threat that could erode pricing power and profitability, especially under economic pressure.",

        "Hop 2: COST \u2192 Private Label Products: Costco Wholesale includes private-label products as a key part of its value proposition, offering them alongside national brands to support high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover at lower gross margins.",
        "Hop 3: MDLZ \u2192 Private Label Products: Mondelez notes that increases in product pricing\u2014driven by inflation and higher input costs\u2014may lead consumers to switch to private label or lower-priced offerings, potentially resulting in lower sales volumes or customer delistings."

MO explicitly states that its pension and postretirement plans invest in actively managed international equity securities, with an approximate 2% allocation to emerging markets within total plan assets. TGT discloses a current targeted allocation of 8% to international equity securities in its overall asset strategy.

For our remaining U.S. plans, our inv estment strategy is to reduce our funded status risk in part through appropriate asset allocation within our plan assets. We attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make monthly benefit payments. The strategy inv olv es using indexed U.S. equity and international equity securities and activ ely managed U.S. inv estment grade fixed-income securities (which constitute 95% or more of fixed-income securities) with smaller allocations to high yield fixed-income securities.\n\nFor our non-U.S. plans, the inv estment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each indiv idual country. In aggregate, the asset allocation targets of our non-U.S. plans are broadly characterized as a mix of approximately 13%  equity  securities, 56%  fixedincome securities, 27% buy-in annuity contracts and 4% real estate.\n\n## Employer Contributions\n\nIn  2024, we contributed $4 million to our  U.S. pension plans and $86 million to our non-U.S. pension plans.  In addition, employees contributed $23 million to our non-U.S. plans. We make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local funding arrangements and statutory minimum funding requirements. Discretionary contributions are made to the extent that they are tax deductible and do not generate an excise tax liability. In 2025, we estimate that our pension contributions will be $11 million to our U.S. plans and $68 million to our non-U.S. plans based on current tax laws. Our actual contributions may be different due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates.\n\n## Future Benefit Payments\n\nThe estimated future benefit payments from our pension plans at December 31, 2024 were (in millions):\n\n",

Many of the com m odities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open m arket. The prices we pay for such item s are subject to fluctuation, and we m anage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreem ents and derivative i n stru m en ts, i n cl u di n g  swaps an d f u tu res.

These  new  or  increased  legal  or  regulatory  requirem ents,  along  with  initiatives  to  m eet  our sustainability goals, could result in significant increased costs and additional investm ents in facilities and equipm ent.

Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Other than our G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset, our goodwill reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets have fair values that significantly ex ceed their underlying carrying values.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, we determined the fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset was less than its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax ) to reduce the carrying amount to be equivalent to the estimated fair value. As of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $12.8 billion. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria.\n\nWhile we have concluded that no triggering event has occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset is susceptible to future impairment risk. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, or market contraction from an economic recession, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a future impairment charge.\n\nThe most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates.\n\nNet sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our G illette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the G illette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rates depend on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency  exchange  rates  and  business  activities  that  impact  market  share. As  a  result,  the  residual  growth  rates  could  be  adversely  impacted  by  a  sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.\n\nThe discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.\n\nThe royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.\n\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis for the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2023, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rates to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rates, which may result in an additional impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.",

      "question": "How do COST, PG, and WMT each assess the strategic importance and risk exposure associated with department stores, and what does this reveal about their differing business models and competitive positioning in the consumer staples sector?",
      "answer": "COST views department stores as part of a broader competitive landscape that includes warehouse clubs, online retailers, and specialty stores, emphasizing the challenge of maintaining market share amid evolving customer expectations and technological capabilities. PG relies on department stores as a key distribution channel, highlighting the risk of reduced shelf space or inventory levels due to competitive pressures and private label brands. WMT competes directly with department stores and emphasizes its omni-channel retail strategy, including automation and supply chain investments, to maintain dominance in a highly competitive environment. Together, these perspectives reveal that COST treats department stores as one of many competitive threats, PG sees them as a critical but vulnerable channel for brand exposure, and WMT actively competes with them by leveraging scale and digital integration.",

If  we  are  unable  to  make,  improv e,  or  dev elop  relev ant  member-facing  technology  in  a  timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adv ersely affected.\n\n## Inability  to  attract,  train  and  retain  highly  qualified  employees   could  advers ely  impact  our  bus ines s ,  financial  condition  and  res ults   of operations.\n\nOur success depends on the continued contributions of our employees, including members of our senior management and other key operations, IT , merchandising and administrativ e personnel. Failure to identify and implement a succession plan for senior management could negativ ely impact our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core v alues. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including regulatory changes, prev ailing wage rates, union relations and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and inv est significant resources in training and motiv ating them. T here is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.\n\nClaims for  employee health care benefits, workers' compensation, general liability,  property  damage,  directors'  and  officers'  liability,  v ehicle  liability, inv entory  loss,  and  other  exposures  are  funded  predominantly  through  self-insurance.  Insurance  cov erage  is  maintained  for  certain  risks  to  limit exposures arising from v ery large losses. T he types and amounts of insurance may v ary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or ev ents, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance cov erage could hav e an adv erse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAlthough we maintain specific cov erages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear a significant portion of the risk of losses incurred as a result of any  physical  damage  to,  or  the  destruction  of,  any  warehouses,  depots,  manufacturing  or  home  office  facilities,  loss  or  spoilage  of  inv entory,  and business interruption. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations.\n\n## Market and Other External Risks\n\nWe  face  strong  competition  from  other  retailers  and  warehouse  club  operators,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe retail business is highly competitiv e. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and serv ices and in other important respects with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse-club operators, supermarkets, supercenters, online retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete v igorously and in a v ariety of ways, including pricing,  selection  and  av ailability,  serv ices,  location,  conv enience,  store  hours,  and  the  attractiv eness  and  ease  of  use  of  websites  and  mobile applications. The ev olution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improv ed the ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors hav e greater financial resources and technology capabilities, including the faster adoption of artificial intelligence, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectiv ely to competitiv e pressures, changes in the retail markets or customer expectations could result in lost market share and negativ ely affect our financial results.",

Inflation pressures sometimes result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results depend, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations and to anticipate consumer reaction to our management of these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.\n\nThe consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry into certain categories and growth in hard discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to  successfully  manage  relationships  with  our  retail  trade  customers,  which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers, private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if the Company or one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients, negative perceptions of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleum-based materials), lack of recyclability  or  other  environmental  attributes,  concerns  about  actual  or  alleged  labor  or  equality  and  inclusion  practices,  privacy  failures  or  data  breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted, and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer. Our Company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental sustainability.

Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.\n\nThroughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.  Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.\n\nManagement also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our ecosystem, such as our advertising net sales. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than 5%. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as \"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nIn discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency ex change rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency ex change rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency ex change rates have impacted and may continue to impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment.\n\nWe have taken certain strategic actions across our segments, including an increased emphasis on investments in automation and supply chain as well as diversifying our earnings streams through category and business mix. In December 2024, the Walmart U.S. segment completed the acquisition of VIZIO Holding Corp. for net cash consideration of $1.9 billion. Additionally, we have taken actions in the Walmart International segment to reshape our portfolio including the following highlights over the last three years:\n\n- In November 2022, we completed the buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary (Refer to Note 3) and in December 2022, we exited operations in certain countries in Africa.\n- In December 2022, we increased our ownership in PhonePe as part of the separation from our majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary. Refer to Note 3.\n- In August 2024, we sold our equity investment in JD.com for net proceeds of $3.6 billion. Refer to Note 8.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce, health and wellness, financial services, advertising and data service businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality associates. We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics and pandemics, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, disruptions in supply chain, inventory management, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, inflation, deflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic",

PepsiCo (PEP) highlights that product recalls due to safety issues\u2014such as contamination or mislabeling\u2014have previously resulted in inventory losses, lost sales, and reputational damage, particularly as it expands into new categories like meat and nut-based convenient foods. Walmart (WMT) underscores the risk of product liability and loss of customer trust due to unsafe products sourced from suppliers, noting that such incidents could materially impact brand reputation and financial performance.

          "chunk_text": "Part II, Item 7 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview.'\n\n## Damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\nMaintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products. Accordingly, we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as our ethics and compliance, DE&amp;I, sustainability and social impact, brand protection and product safety, regulatory and quality initiatives. Negative publicity about us, our brands, our products, our supply chain, our ingredients, our packaging, our environmental, social and governance ('ESG') practices, including as they relate to sustainability, DE&amp;I, or our employees, whether or not deserved, could jeopardize our reputation. Such negative publicity could relate to, among other things, health concerns, threatened or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings, environmental impact (including deforestation, packaging, plastic, energy and water use and waste management), our ESG practices or our sustainability targets. In addition, the proliferation of digital and social media has greatly increased the accessibility of information and the speed of its dissemination and the potential for negative publicity. Negative publicity, posts or comments on digital and social media about us, our brands, our products, our sustainability efforts, our environmental and social impact (including our packaging) or our employees, whether true or untrue, could damage our brands and our reputation. The success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers.\n\nAdditionally, due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other external business partners, for certain functions. While we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, compliance and ESG practices, thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk.\n\nIn addition, third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products, which are inferior or may pose safety risks. As a result, consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products, which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nDamage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation.\n\n## Our success depends upon our ability to recruit, attract and retain key employees, including through the implementation of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and the succession of senior management.\n\nOur success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees. If we are unable to recruit, attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key people, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. Successfully executing organizational change, including management transitions at leadership levels of the Company and succession plans for senior management, is critical to our business success. While we follow a disciplined, ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time. Further, changes in immigration laws and government policies, including related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have made, in certain circumstances, and may continue to make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled technical, professional and management personnel to meet our business needs. Our ability to attract and retain talent has been and may continue to be impacted by challenges in the labor market, particularly in the United States, which is experiencing wage inflation, labor shortages, a shift toward remote work and the effects of COVID-19. In addition, we also continue to work to advance culture change through the implementation of DE&amp;I initiatives throughout our organization. We are also implementing new ways of working to, among other things, instill a growth mindset to drive innovation with focus, empowerment, experimentation and digitization. If we do not (or are perceived not to) successfully implement these initiatives, our ability to recruit, attract and retain talent may be adversely impacted.",

These  and  other  factors  have  reduced  in  the  past  and  could  continue  to  reduce  consumers' willingness to purchase certain of our products. Any inability on our part to anticipate or react to changes in consumer preferences and trends, or make the right strategic investments to do so, including investments in data analytics to understand consumer trends, can lead to reduced demand for our products, lead to inventory write-offs  or  erode  our  competitive  and  financial  position,  thereby  adversely  affecting  our  business.  In addition, our business operations, including our supply chain, are subject to disruption by natural disasters or other events beyond our control that could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not effectively resolve these issues.\n\n## Damage to our reputation or brand image can adversely affect our business.\n\nMaintaining a positive reputation globally is critical to selling our products. Our reputation or brand image has in the past been, and could in the future be, adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including: any failure  by  us  or  our  business  partners  to  maintain  high  ethical,  business  and  environmental,  social  and governance  practices,  including  with  respect  to  human  rights,  child  labor  laws,  diversity,  equity  and inclusion, workplace conditions and employee health and safety; any failure to achieve our environmental, social and governance goals, including with respect to the nutrition profile of our products, diversity, equity and  inclusion  initiatives,  packaging,  water  use  and  our  impact  on  the  environment;  any  failure  to  address health  concerns  about  our  products,  products  we  distribute,  or  particular  ingredients  in  our  products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity or an increase in public health costs; our research and development efforts; any product quality or safety issues, including the recall of  any  of  our  products;  any  failure  to  comply  with  laws  and  regulations;  consumer  perception  of  our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, marketing programs, use of social media and our response to  political  and  social  issues  or  catastrophic  events;  or  any  failure  to  effectively  respond  to  negative  or inaccurate comments about us on social media or otherwise regarding any of the foregoing. Damage to our reputation or brand image has in the past and could in the future decrease demand for our products, thereby adversely affecting our business.\n\n## Product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety can adversely affect our business.\n\nWe have and could in the future recall products due to product quality or safety issues, including actual or alleged  mislabeling,  misbranding,  spoilage,  undeclared  allergens,  adulteration  or  contamination.  Product recalls have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business by resulting in losses due to their cost, the destruction of product inventory or lost sales due to any unavailability of the product for a period of time. In addition, product quality or safety issues, whether as a result of failure to comply with food safety laws or otherwise, have in the past and could in the future also reduce consumer confidence and demand for our products, cause production and delivery disruptions, and result in increased costs (including payment of fines and/or judgments) and damage our reputation, particularly as we expand into new categories, such as nuts and meat convenient foods globally and the distribution of alcoholic beverages in the United States, all of which can adversely affect our business. Failure to maintain adequate oversight over product quality or safety  can  result  in  product  recalls,  litigation,  government  investigations  or  inquiries  or  civil  or  criminal proceedings, all of which may result in fines, penalties, damages or criminal liability. Our business can also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality, safety and integrity generally, even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio.",

Certain impacts of physical risk may include: temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at stores, clubs, and distribution or fulfillment centers; extreme weather patterns that affect the production or sourcing of certain commodities; flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory; and heat and extreme weather events that cause long-term disruption or threats to the habitability of the communities in which Walmart operates. Relative to transition risk, certain impacts may include: changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate-related weather events; prolonged climate-related events affecting macroeconomic conditions with related effects on consumer spending and confidence; stakeholder perception of our engagement in climate-related policies; and new regulatory requirements resulting in higher compliance risk and operational costs.\n\nWe bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\n## Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner and in the large volumes we may demand, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.\n\nPolitical and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries and entities, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nIf the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance. We are also subject to reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms.\n\nOur customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. Whether laws related to these marketplace transactions apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes could expose us to loss of sales, reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen, or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law or the proprietary rights of others. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommerce growth and flywheel strategy.",

PepsiCo (PEP) uses spot rates along the yield curve to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities, with U.S. obligations based on the Mercer Above Mean Curve. Procter & Gamble (PG) uses specific spot rates along the corporate bond yield curve for the majority of its plans, while the remaining plans use a single weighted average discount rate derived from the same yield curve.

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) uses swaps as part of a broader set of derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk, and interest rate risk, emphasizing that these derivatives are carried at fair value and are not used for trading purposes. PepsiCo (PEP) employs swaps and futures to manage exposure to commodity price fluctuations, particularly for key raw materials like corn, sugar, and packaging inputs, which are critical to its beverage and snack food operations. Philip Morris (PM) incorporates swaps into its value-at-risk (VaR) model to estimate potential losses in derivative portfolios due to foreign exchange and interest rate volatility, maintaining a conservative stance by avoiding leveraged or structured derivatives. Together, these approaches show that KO focuses on structured hedging across multiple risks, PEP prioritizes commodity cost stability, and PM emphasizes conservative risk modeling and counterparty selection.",

          "chunk_text": "## Captive Insurance Companies\n\nIn accordance with local insurance regulations, our consolidated captive insurance companies are required to meet and maintain minimum solvency capital requirements. The Company elected to invest a majority of its solvency capital in a portfolio of marketable equity and debt securities. These securities are included in the disclosures above. The Company uses one of our consolidated captive insurance companies to reinsure group annuity insurance contracts that cover the obligations of certain of our European and Canadian pension plans. This captive's solvency capital funds included total equity and debt securities of $1,670 million and $1,389 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which were classified in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets because the assets are not available to satisfy our current obligations.\n\n## NOTE 5: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company's financial performance and are referred to as 'market risks.' When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\n\nThe Company uses various types of derivative instruments including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative returns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect expected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes) a call option, or alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-derivative instruments, such as our foreign currency denominated thirdparty debt, in hedging relationships.\n\nAll derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with the same counterparty.\n\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our consolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the values of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings.",

DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.\n\n## Customer Warehouse\n\nSome of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and distribution centers, both company and third-party operated, to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover.\n\n## Distributor Networks\n\nWe distribute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective  when  greater  distribution  reach  can  be  achieved  by  including  a  wide  range  of  products  on  the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages and convenient foods  to restaurants,  businesses,  schools  and  stadiums  through  third-party  foodservice  and  vending distributors and operators.\n\n## E-commerce\n\nOur products are also available and sold directly to consumers on a growing number of company-owned and third-party e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.\n\n## Ingredients and Other Supplies\n\nThe  principal  ingredients  we  use  in  our  beverage  and  convenient  food  products  are  apple,  orange  and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, grapefruit, oranges and other fruits, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for convenient foods, aluminum, glass, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. In addition, we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and support the increased use of recycled content, including recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel, electricity and natural gas  are  also  important  commodities  for  our  businesses  due  to  their  use  in  our  and  our  business  partners' facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of  these  items  and  have  not  experienced  any  significant  continuous  shortages  that  would  prevent  us  from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use  of  fixed-price  contracts  and  purchase  orders,  pricing  agreements  and  derivative  instruments,  including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural  supply  chain,  including  the  development  of  our  initiative  to  advance  sustainable  farming practices  by  our  suppliers  and  expanding  it  further  globally.  During  2021,  we  experienced  higher  than anticipated  commodity,  packaging  and  other  input  costs  and,  in  some  instances,  limited  shortages  due  to global  inflation,  supply  chain  disruptions,  labor  shortages,  increased  demand  and  other  regulatory  and macroeconomic factors associated with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which has continued into  fiscal  2022.  See  Note  9  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further  information  on  how  we manage our exposure to commodity prices.",

These banks are also part of a defined group of relationship banks. Non-investment grade institutions are only used in certain emerging markets to the extent required by local business needs. We have a conservative approach when it comes to choosing financial counterparties and financial instruments. As such we do not invest or hold investments in any structured or equity-linked products. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents is currently invested with maturities of less than 30 days.\n\nWe continuously monitor and assess the credit worthiness of all our counterparties.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments We operate in markets outside of the United States of America, with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations throughout the world. Consequently, we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency and interest rate  exposure. We use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nSee  Item  8,  Note  15. Financial  Instruments to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further  details  on  our  derivative  financial instruments and the related collateral arrangements.\n\nValue at Risk -We use a value at risk computation to estimate the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest-rate-sensitive and foreign currency price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. This computation includes our debt and foreign currency forwards, swaps and options. Anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the computation.\n\nThe computation estimates were made assuming normal market conditions, using a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period using a \"parametric delta-gamma\" approximation technique to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies and in calculating the risk of the underlying positions in the portfolio. These interrelationships were determined by  observing  interest  rate  and  forward  currency  rate  movements  primarily  over  the  preceding  quarter  for  determining  value  at  risk  at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and primarily over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average, high and low value at risk amounts during each year.\n\n",

Organic sales in Africa/Eurasia increased 7.0% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by Turkiye, Nigeria and South Africa.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was primarily due to an increase in Oral Care organic sales.

Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 42 percent of U.S. unit case volume. Unit case volume outside the United States represented 83 percent of the Company's worldwide unit case volume in 2021. The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 48 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\n\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

          "chunk_text": "Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.\n\nThe Walmart U.S. business also includes an in-house advertising offering via Walmart Connect, supply chain and fulfillment capabilities to online marketplace sellers via Walmart Fulfillment Services, and access to quality, affordable healthcare via Walmart Health. In Fiscal 2022, Walmart U.S. initiatives also included the launch of a B2B last mile delivery service platform via Walmart GoLocal, and Walmart Luminate which provides a suite of data products to merchants and suppliers. Additional service offerings include fuel, financial services and related products (including through our digital channels, stores and clubs as well as our previously announced fintech joint venture), such as money orders, prepaid access, money transfers, check cashing, bill payment, and certain types of installment lending. Combined, these offerings do not currently represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues.\n\nOperations. Walmart U.S. is available to customers through supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets, as well as online or through the mobile application 24 hours a day. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart U.S. continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help stores operate more efficiently, such as pickup and delivery, Walmart+, shipfrom-store and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences.\n\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.\n\nCompetition. Walmart U.S. competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercentertype stores, eCommerce retailers, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers, and greater brand recognition. They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.\n\nOur ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. We employ many strategies and programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These strategies include the following:\n\n- EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;\n- EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers;\n- Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery and our Walmart+ membership offering, all of which enhance convenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served; and\n- Expanding our flywheel and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital advertising, fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial services.\n\nDistribution. We utilize a total of 157 distribution facilities which are located strategically throughout the U.S. For fiscal 2022, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 31 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as leveraging our ability to ship or deliver directly from more than 3,500 stores.\n\n## Walmart International Segment\n\nWalmart International is our second largest segment and operated in 23 countries outside of the U.S. as of January 31, 2022. Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, and China, and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa (which includes Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), India, as well as Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua).

The new guidance requires a public entity to disclose on an annual and interim  basis: (1) significant segm ent expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each reported m easure of segm ent profit or loss, (2) an am ount for other segm ent item s (the difference between segm ent revenue less the significant expenses disclosed under the significant expense principle and each reported m easure of segment profit or loss), including a description of its com position, and (3) inform ation about a reportable segm ent's: (a) profit or loss, and (b) assets,  i f   provi ded  to  CODM,  and  on  an  annual  basis,  the  titl e  and  posi ti on  of  the  CODM  and  an  explanation  of  how  the  CODM  uses  the reported measure(s) of segm ent profit or loss in assessing segm ent perform ance and how to allocate resources. The new guidance also clarifies that i f  th e CODM uses m ore than one m easure of a segm ent's profit or loss, one or m ore of those m easures m ay be reported and requires that a public entity that has a single reportable segm ent provide all the disclosures required by the am endm ents in the guidance and all existing segm ent disclosures. We adopted the guidance in our 2024 annual reporting, on a retrospective basis. See Note 1 for further inform ation.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued guidance to enhance the transparency of supplier finance program s to allow financial statem ent users to understand the effect on working capital, liquidity and cash flows. The new guidance requires disclosure of key term s of the program , including a description of the paym ent term s, paym ent tim ing and assets pledged as security or other form s of guarantees provided to the finance provider or i n term edi ary . Other requi rem ents i ncl ude the di scl osure of the am ount that rem ains unpaid as of the end of the reporting period, a description of where these obligations are presented in the balance sheet and a rollforward of the obligation during the annual period. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2023, except for the rollforward, which we adopted in our 2024 annual reporting, on a prospective basis. See Note 14 for further inform ation.\n\n## Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn  November  2024,  the  FASB  issued  guidance  to  im prove  the  disclosure  of  expenses  in  com m only  presented  expense  captions.  The  new guidance requires a public entity to provide tabular disclosure, on an annual and interim  basis, of am ounts for the following expense categories: (1) purchases of inventory , (2) em ployee com pensation, (3) depreciation and (4) intangible asset am ortization, as included in each relevant expense caption. A  relevant  expense  caption  is  an  expense  caption  presented  on  the  face  of  the  incom e  statem ent  that  contains  any  of  the  expense categories  noted. Additionally ,  on  an  annual  and  interim   basis,  a  qualitative  description  is  required  for  am ounts  rem aining  in  relevant  expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively. The guidance also requires certain am ounts that are",

          "chunk_text": "Inventory and cost of sales: The v ast majority of our inv entory is accounted for under the retail inv entory accounting method using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO). Our inv entory is v alued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. We reduce inv entory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses and is adjusted to reflect results of actual physical inv entory counts. We generally perform counts at each location annually, with counts taking place throughout the year. A 10 percent increase or decrease in our 2024 year-end inv entory shrink reserv e would impact our cost of sales by approximately $150 million. Historically, our actual physical inv entory count results hav e shown our estimates to be reasonably accurate. Market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Salability can be impacted by consumer preferences and seasonality, among other factors. We believ e the risk of inv entory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inv entory typically turns in less than three months. Inv entory was $12.7 billion and $1 1.9 billion as of February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, respectiv ely, and is further described in Note 8 to the Financial Statements.\n\nVendor income: We receiv e v arious forms of consideration from our v endors (v endor income), principally earned as a result of v olume rebates, promotions, advertising allowances, and markdown allowances. Vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales except in arrangements where the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs and recorded as an offset to those costs.  Vendor income earned can v ary based on a number of factors, including purchase v olumes, sales v olumes, and our pricing and promotion strategies.\n\nWe establish a receiv able for v endor income that is earned but not yet receiv ed. Based on historical trending and data, this receiv able is computed by forecasting v endor income collections and estimating the amount earned. The majority of the year-end v endor income receiv ables are collected within the following  fiscal  quarter ,  and  we  do  not  believ e  there  is  a  reasonable  likelihood  that  the  assumptions  used  in  our  estimate  will  change  significantly. Historically,  adjustments  to  our  v endor  income  receiv able  hav e  not  been  material.  Vendor  income  receiv able  was  $543  million  and  $513  million  as  of February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, respectiv ely. Vendor income is described further in Note 4 to the Financial Statements.\n\nLong-lived assets: Long-liv ed assets are rev iewed for impairment whenev er ev ents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recov erable. T he ev aluation is performed primarily at the store lev el. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or ev entual disposition of the asset or asset group are less than its carrying amount, and is measured as the excess of its carrying amount ov er fair v alue. We estimate fair v alue by obtaining market appraisals, obtaining v aluations from third-party brokers, or using other v aluation techniques. We recorded impairments of $68 million, $102 million, and $66 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectiv ely, which are described further in Note 10 to the Financial Statements.\n\nInsurance/self-insurance: We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss cov erage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of their net present v alue; other  liabilities  referred  to  abov e  are  not  discounted.  Our  workers'  compensation  and  general  liability  accrual  was  $772  million  and  $650  million  as  of February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, respectiv ely. We believ e that the amounts accrued are appropriate; howev er, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss dev elopments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 10 percent increase or decrease in av erage claim costs would have impacted our self-insurance expense by $77 million in 2024. Historically, adjustments to our estimates hav e not been material. Refer to Part II, Item  7A,  Quantitativ e  and  Qualitativ e  Disclosures About  Market  Risk,  for  further  disclosure  of  the  market  risks  associated  with  these  exposures.  We maintain insurance cov erage to limit our exposure to certain ev ents, including network security matters.\n\n2024 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "MDLZ highlights that changes in currency exchange rates, controls, and restrictions are among the key risks that could materially impact its financial performance, particularly due to its global operations and exposure to emerging markets. PEP notes that as of December 30, 2023, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in its consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or exchange restrictions were not material, indicating a relatively low exposure. PG states that currency controls and foreign exchange fluctuations have negatively impacted its net sales, earnings, and cash flows in the past, especially in markets with devalued or highly inflationary currencies. Together, these perspectives suggest that while all three companies operate internationally, they face differing levels of exposure and risk from currency controls, with PG experiencing tangible negative impacts, PEP maintaining limited exposure, and MDLZ emphasizing the potential for material risk due to its broader emerging market presence.",

PEP highlights exposure to nationalization as one of several geopolitical and regulatory risks in international markets, particularly in developing economies. WMT identifies nationalization as a risk in its international operations, which accounted for approximately 18% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2025, and specifically notes regulatory scrutiny in countries like India and Mexico.

We market our products in ov er 150 countries and hav e operations in approximately 80 countries. Therefore, we are subject to risks inherent in global operations. Those risks include:\n\n- the imposition of increased or new tariffs, sanctions, export controls, quotas, trade barriers, price floors or similar restrictions on our sales or key commodities like cocoa, potential changes in U.S. trade programs and trade relations with other countries, or regulations, taxes or policies that affect our operations, sales or profitability. Also see ' We are subject to risks from changes to the trade policies and tariff and import/export regulations by the U.S. and/or other foreign government s';\n- changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of inflation (and related monetary policy actions by gov ernments in response to inflation), v olatile commodity prices, the ongoing longer-term impact of changes in international trade policies (including Brexit) and increases in the cost of raw and packaging materials, labor, energy and transportation;\n- compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, including anti-bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ('FCPA');\n- compliance with antitrust and competition laws, trade laws, data priv acy laws, anti-bribery laws, human rights laws, new regulations intended to address increasing global concerns around forced labor, and a v ariety of other local, national and multinational regulations and laws in multiple regimes;\n- currency dev aluations or fluctuations in currency v alues, including in dev eloped and emerging markets. T his includes ev ents like applying highly inflationary accounting as we did for our Argentinean subsidiaries beginning in the third quarter of 2018, T \u00fcrkiye beginning in the second quarter of 2022 and both Egypt and Nigeria beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024;\n- changes in capital  controls,  including  currency  exchange  controls,  gov ernment  currency  policies  or  other  limits  on  our  ability  to  import  raw materials or finished products into v arious countries or repatriate cash from outside the United States;\n- increased  sov ereign  risk,  such  as  defaults  by  or  deterioration  in  the  economies  and  credit  ratings  of  gov ernments,  particularly  in  emerging markets;\n- changes  or  inconsistencies  in  local  regulations  and  laws,  the  uncertainty  of  enforcement  of  remedies  in  non-U.S.  jurisdictions,  and  foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources;\n- varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights;\n- discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies;\n- greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; and\n- design, implementation and use of effectiv e control env ironment processes across our div erse operations and employee base.\n\nIn addition, increased political and economic changes or v olatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activ ity, political unrest, civ il strife, acts of war , government shutdowns, product boycotts, trav el or immigration restrictions, tariffs and other trade restrictions, public health risks or pandemics, energy policy  or  restrictions,  public  corruption,  expropriation  and  other  economic  or  political  uncertainties,  including  inaccuracies  in  our  assumptions  about these factors, could interrupt and negativ ely affect our business operations or customer demand. For example, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East could impact demand for our products or result in increased supply chain costs or other cost impacts. High unemployment or the slowdown in economic growth in some markets could constrain consumer spending. Declining consumer purchasing power could result in loss of market share and adv ersely impact our profitability. The nature and degree of the v arious risks we face can also differ significantly among our regions and businesses.\n\nAll of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased rev enues and could materially and adv ersely affect our product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, stock price, and our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees in the short- or long-term.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  ris ks   from  changes   to  the  trade  policies   and  tariff  and  import/export  regulations   by  the  U.S.  and/or  other  foreign governments.\n\nChanges in the import and export policies, including trade restrictions, new or increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, sanctions and countersanctions, safeguards or customs restrictions by the U.S. and/or other foreign",

Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.\n\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores, clubs and eCommerce platforms around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our results of operations.\n\n## Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks\n\nOur international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.\n\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we operate retail and eCommerce businesses in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.\n\nDuring fiscal 2025, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions; legal and regulatory constraints, such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as in India; restrictive governmental actions, such as trade protection measures or nationalization; antitrust and competition law regulatory matters, such as those underway in Canada, Mexico and India (relating to our Flipkart subsidiary); local product safety and environmental laws; tax regulations; local labor laws; anti-money laundering laws and regulations; trade policies; foreign ex change or currency regulations; laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection; and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.\n\nChanging our operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade or newly imposed sanctions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and we may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. In addition, tensions between nation-state governments and conflicts of laws may lead to challenges for our operations. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response, or consumer boycotts in certain regions, could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could also adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they recur, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also ex ist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, geopolitical tensions or events, laws and regulations.\n\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or U.S. sanctions laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries. Our global policies designed to regulate such business practices and our global compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations may not be adequate to prevent the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are appropriately regulated by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could subject us to fines and penalties and adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.",

          "chunk_text": "## COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19 have had and continue to have a profound impact on the way people live, work, interact and shop and have significantly impacted and continue to impact economic activity around the world. We have a well-established Crisis Management Team ('CMT') process, and the CMT, together with our senior management team and Colgate people around the world, continue to respond to and manage the challenges presented by COVID-19.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the communities in which we manufacture, market and sell our products experienced and in some cases continue to experience 'stay at home' orders, travel or movement restrictions and other government actions to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19, and have implemented varying policies to address the pandemic, resume economic activity and vaccinate their populations. The situation continues to be uncertain and varies by geography, as the impact of COVID-19 remains significant in many countries throughout the world, including Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Thailand, the U.S. and Vietnam, where we have substantial manufacturing facilities. Because the vast majority of our products (such as oral care products, soaps and other personal hygiene products, home cleaners and pet food) have been deemed essential for the health and well-being of people and their pets, we have, in most instances, been able to continue operating our business, although not always at full capacity.\n\nThe health, safety and well-being of our employees and their families has been and remains our first priority. While we have reopened most of our offices, in some instances on a limited and voluntary basis, many of our office-based employees globally continue to work from home. We have implemented additional health and safety measures consistent with government recommendations and/or requirements to help ensure employee safety in our offices, production facilities, warehouses and technology centers, often at additional cost. These measures may include: health and temperature screening, social distancing and personal protective equipment protocols, hand washing, contact tracing, enhanced cleaning procedures, respiratory hygiene, education and, in some instances, testing and/or vaccination requirements. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen increased instances of absenteeism and, in some cases, we have experienced some limited production facility closures and related supply chain disruptions. Furthermore, some of our suppliers, customers, distributors, logistics providers and service providers have experienced disruptions to their businesses.\n\nWe saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories, such as liquid hand soap, dish liquid, bar soap and cleaners, during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by consumer pantry-loading and increased consumption of our products. While consumer demand for most of these categories declined year-over-year in 2021, most still remained above historical levels, and we believe that some of this increase in consumption is sustainable in light of changes in consumer behavior related to COVID-19. Across our business, changes in consumer demand for our products vary by product category, channel and geography depending on, among other things, the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, the availability of our products at retailers and supply chain disruptions. At the same time, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced disruptions in certain channels, including travel retail. We also continue to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers, including the nature and/or frequency of visits by consumers to retailers and dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online.\n\nCOVID-19 and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19 have impacted and may continue to impact our consumers' ability to purchase and our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. While we believe that, in the long-term, consumer demand for the products in our categories will continue to be strong, uncertainties continue surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. These uncertainties include: the impact of the timing and scale of changes to travel and movement restrictions in certain geographies, the availability and widespread distribution and use of COVID-19 vaccines, the emergence and spread of COVID-19 variants, the timing and impact of consumer pantry-loading and destocking activity in certain markets, product demand trends and the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy, including as a result of inflation, and supply chain disruptions. COVID-19 has also disrupted our retail customers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers and other third parties; their ability to address COVID-19 and maintain their operations at full capacity has impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products. We expect the ongoing economic impact and health concerns associated with COVID-19 to continue to impact consumer behavior, shopping patterns and consumption preferences during 2022.\n\nWhile we currently expect to be able to continue operating our business as described above and we intend to continue to work with government authorities and to follow the necessary protocols to maintain the health and safety of our employees and third parties, uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 could result in an unforeseen additional disruption to our business, including our global supply chain and retailer network, and/or require us to incur additional operational costs.\n\nFor more information about the anticipated COVID-19 impact, see 'Outlook' below.",

These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 13-percentagepoint impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses.

On  January  26,  2017,  the  Public  Prosecutor  filed  charges  against  PM  Thailand  and  its former Thai employee in the Bangkok Criminal Court alleging that PM Thailand and its former employee jointly and with the intention to defraud the Thai government under-declared import prices of cigarettes to avoid full payment of taxes and duties in connection with import entries  during  the  period  from  January  2002  to  July  2003.  The  government  is  seeking  a  fine  of  approximately  THB  19.8  billion (approximately $599 million). In May 2017, Thailand enacted  a new customs act. The new act, which took effect in November 2017, substantially limits the amount of fines that Thailand could seek in these proceedings. PM Thailand believes that its declared import prices are in compliance with the Customs Valuation Agreement of the World Trade Organization and Thai law, and that the allegations of the Public  Prosecutor  are  inconsistent  with  several  decisions  already  taken  by  Thai  Customs  and  a  Thai  court.  Trial  in  the  case  began  in November 2018 and concluded in December 2019. In March 2020, the trial court found our subsidiary guilty of under-declaration of the prices and imposed a fine of approximately THB 130 million (approximately $4 million). The trial court dismissed all charges against the individual defendant. In April 2020, as required by Thai law, our subsidiary paid the fine. This payment is included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements  of  cash  flows  in  the  period  of  payment.  Our  subsidiary  filed  an  appeal  of  the  trial  court's  decision.  In  addition,  the  Public Prosecutor filed an appeal of the trial court's decision challenging the dismissal of charges against the individual defendant and the amount of the fine imposed. If our subsidiary ultimately prevails on appeal, then Thailand will be required to return this payment to our subsidiary.\n\nThe South Korean Board of Audit and Inspection ('BAI') conducted an audit of certain Korean government agencies and the tobacco industry  into  whether  inventory  movements  ahead  of  the  January  1,  2015  increase  of  cigarette-related  taxes  by  tobacco  companies, including  Philip  Morris  Korea  Inc.  (\"PM  Korea\"),  our  South  Korean  subsidiary,  were  in  compliance  with  South  Korean  tax  laws.    In November  2016,  the  tax  authorities  completed  their  audit  and  assessed  allegedly  underpaid  taxes  and  penalties.    In  order  to  avoid nonpayment financial costs, PM Korea paid approximately KRW 272 billion (approximately $227 million), of which KRW 100 billion (approximately  $83  million)  was  paid  in  2016  and  KRW  172  billion  (approximately  $143  million)  was  paid  in  the  first  quarter  of 2017.  These paid amounts are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the period of payment.  PM Korea appealed the assessments. In January 2020, a trial  court  ruled  that  PM  Korea  did  not  underpay  taxes  in  the  amount  of  approximately  KRW  218  billion  (approximately  $182 million). The tax authorities appealed this decision to the appellate court. In September 2020, the appellate court upheld the trial court's decision. The tax authorities have appealed to the Supreme Court of South Korea. In June 2020, another trial court ruled that PM Korea did not underpay approximately KRW 54 billion (approximately $45 million) of alleged underpayments. The government agencies appealed this decision. In January 2021, the appellate court upheld the trial court's decision. The government agencies appealed to the Supreme Court of South Korea. If the tax authorities and government agencies ultimately lose, then they would be required to return the paid amounts to PM Korea.\n\nThe Moscow Tax Inspectorate for Major Taxpayers ('MTI') conducted an audit of AO Philip Morris Izhora ('PM Izhora'), our Russian subsidiary,  for  the  2015-2017  financial  years.  On  July  26,  2019,  MTI  issued  its  initial  assessment,  claiming  that  intercompany  sales  of cigarettes between PM Izhora and another Russian subsidiary prior to excise tax increases and submission by PM Izhora of the maximum retail sales price notifications for cigarettes to the tax authorities were improper under Russian tax laws and resulted in underpayment of excise  taxes  and  V AT.  In  August  2019,  PM  Izhora  submitted  its  objections  disagreeing  with  MTI's  allegations  set  forth  in  the  initial assessment  and  MTI's  methodology  for  calculating  the  alleged  underpayments.  MTI  accepted  some  of  PM  Izhora's  arguments,  and  in September 2019, issued the final tax assessment claiming an underpayment of RUB $24.3 billion (approximately $374 million), including penalties and interest. In accordance with Russian tax laws, PM Izhora paid the entire amount of MTI's final assessment. This amount was neither imposed on, nor concurrent with, the specific revenue-producing transaction, nor was it collected from customers of our Russian subsidiaries. In the third quarter of 2019, PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $374 million, in marketing, administration and research costs in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings, representing $315 million net of an associated income tax benefit of $59 million.\n\nThe  Saudi Arabia  Customs  General Authority  issued  its  assessments  requiring  our  distributors  to  pay  additional  customs  duties  in  the amount of approximately 1.5 billion Saudi Riyal, or approximately $396 million, in relation to the fees paid by these distributors under their agreements with our subsidiary for exclusive rights to distribute our products in Saudi Arabia. In order to challenge these assessments, the distributors  posted  bank  guarantees. To  enable  the  distributors'  challenge,  our  subsidiary  agreed  with  the  banks  to  bear  a  portion  of  the amount the authority may draw on the bank guarantees. In September and October 2020, respectively, the distributors lost their challenges of the assessments. Both distributors appealed, and in June 2021, the Customs Appeal Committee in Riyadh notified the distributors of its decisions to largely reject their appeals. On the basis of the above-mentioned decisions, in June 2021, PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $246 million in relation to the period of 2014 through 2020 in line with existing and contemplated arrangements with the distributors. The estimated amounts for 2021 are immaterial. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the charge was recorded as a reduction in net revenues on the consolidated  statements  of  earnings  for  the  three  months  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2021.  Despite  the  unfavorable  decisions,  our subsidiary believes that customs duties paid in Saudi Arabia were in compliance with the applicable law and the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement.",

PEP highlights a strong dependency on mass merchandisers, particularly Walmart, which accounted for 14% of its consolidated net revenue, and outlines extensive financial incentives to secure product placement and promotional support. PG includes mass merchandisers as a primary channel among many and reports $9.6 billion in advertising spending in 2024, which includes in-store advertising and consumer promotions aimed at driving retail performance.

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nNOTE 1\n\n## SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company's (the \"Company,\" \"Procter &amp; Gamble,\" \"we\" or \"us\") business is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior  quality  and  value.  Our  products  are  sold  in  about 180  countries  and  territories  primarily  through  mass  merchandisers,  e-commerce  (including  social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies,  electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell  direct  to  consumers.  We  have  on-the-ground operations in about 70 countries.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated.\n\n## Use of E stimates\n\nPreparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items,  consumer and trade promotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, postretirement benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax  positions and contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although  management  does  not  generally  believe  such  differences  would  materially  affect  the  financial  statements  in  any  individual  year.  However,  regarding ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those anticipated at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that materially affect the financial statements in a given year.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period the revenue is recognized. The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. The revenue includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to the customer.\n\nTrade  promotions,  consisting  primarily  of  customer  pricing  allowances,  merchandising  funds  and  consumer  coupons,  are  offered  through  various  programs  to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in the Accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nCost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacturing of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expenses necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished products. Cost of products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative E xpense\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense (SG &amp;A) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items.  Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $2.0 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022. Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include television, print, radio, digital and in-store advertising ex penses and were $9.6 billion in 2024, $8.0 billion in 2023 and $7.9 billion in 2022. Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending reported in SG&amp;A include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids.\n\n## Other Non-Operating Income, Net\n\nOther non-operating income, net primarily includes divestiture gains, net non-service impacts related to postretirement benefit plans, investment income, accumulated foreign currency translation losses and other non-operating items.\n\nAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherw ise specified.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) highlights strong organic sales growth in Colombia as a key contributor to Latin America's 15.5% organic sales increase in 2023, driven by growth in Oral Care, Personal Care, and Home Care categories. PepsiCo (PEP) notes a double-digit decline in convenient foods volume in Colombia, contrasting with mid-single-digit beverage volume growth. Philip Morris International (PM) indicates strategic expansion in Colombia through the commercialization of its BONDS product, part of its broader smoke-free product rollout in the region.

Costco uses LIFO for U.S. merchandise inventories and recorded a $438 million LIFO charge in 2022 due to inflation, indicating a significant impact on its cost of goods sold. PepsiCo, in contrast, applies LIFO to only about 7% and 6% of its inventory cost in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and notes that the difference between LIFO and FIFO was not material, suggesting minimal strategic reliance on LIFO.

Advertising costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred. Certain consumer and trade promotional programs, such as consumer coupons, are recorded as a reduction of sales.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe cost of approximately 75% of inventories is determined using the FIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of all other inventories, in the U.S. and Mexico, is determined using the LIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories in excess of one year of forecasted sales are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent 'Other assets.'\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nLand, buildings and machinery and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided, primarily using the straight-line method, over-estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings. Depreciation attributable to manufacturing operations is included in Cost of sales. The remaining component of depreciation is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangibles\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the Company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Other intangible assets with finite lives, such as local brands and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 40 years. Amortization expense related to intangible assets is included in Other (income) expense, net, which is included in Operating profit.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect at the time such differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive model to recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on an income tax return. The Company recognizes interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within Provision for income taxes.",

The  Company  believes  the  LIFO  method  more  fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation or deflation rates and inventory levels have been determined.  Due  to  inflation,  a  $438  charge  was  recorded  during  2022  to  merchandise  costs  to  increase  the cumulative LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories at August 28, 2022. An immaterial LIFO charge was recorded in 2021. Canadian and Other International merchandise inventories are predominantly valued using the cost and retail inventory methods, respectively, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.\n\nThe Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts using estimates based on experience.  The  provision  is  adjusted  periodically  to  reflect  physical  inventory  counts,  which  generally  occur  in  the second and fourth fiscal quarters.

RISK FACTORS\n\nIn addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report, set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities. These risks, some of which have occurred and/or are occurring and any of which could occur in the future, are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.\n\n## Business and Industry Risks\n\nWe face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nWe operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately two-thirds of our Net sales originating in markets outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we face risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:\n\n- changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of inflationary pressure, economic slowdown or recession, the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, major developments in trade relations, volatile commodity prices and increases and/or volatility in the cost of raw and packaging materials, labor, energy and logistics;\n- changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows from non-U.S. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars, in those markets;\n- political instability or uncertainty, including as a result of elections, economic instability, geopolitical events and tensions, wars and military conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East and tensions between China and Taiwan;\n- changes to trade policies and agreements and other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of and/or the increase in trade restrictions and/or tariffs, sanctions, price controls, labor laws, travel or immigration restrictions, profit controls or other government controls, including as a result of the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East and tensions between China and Taiwan;\n- environmental events, widespread health emergencies, such as pandemics or epidemics, natural disasters or social or labor unrest;\n- exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import or ex port raw materials or finished product, including as a result of the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, or to repatriate earnings from overseas;\n- lack of well-established, reliable and/or impartial legal systems in certain countries where we operate and difficulties in enforcing contractual, intellectual property or other legal rights; and\n- foreign ownership and investment restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources.\n\nAny or all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix  from higher margin to lower margin product offerings.\n\nWe face risks resulting from political and macroeconomic instability and geopolitical events and tensions, such as the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East and tensions between China and Taiwan.

T his includes ev ents like applying highly inflationary accounting as we did for our Argentinean subsidiaries beginning in the third quarter of 2018, T \u00fcrkiye beginning in the second quarter of 2022 and both Egypt and Nigeria beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024;\n- changes in capital  controls,  including  currency  exchange  controls,  gov ernment  currency  policies  or  other  limits  on  our  ability  to  import  raw materials or finished products into v arious countries or repatriate cash from outside the United States;\n- increased  sov ereign  risk,  such  as  defaults  by  or  deterioration  in  the  economies  and  credit  ratings  of  gov ernments,  particularly  in  emerging markets;\n- changes  or  inconsistencies  in  local  regulations  and  laws,  the  uncertainty  of  enforcement  of  remedies  in  non-U.S.  jurisdictions,  and  foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources;\n- varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights;\n- discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies;\n- greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; and\n- design, implementation and use of effectiv e control env ironment processes across our div erse operations and employee base.\n\nIn addition, increased political and economic changes or v olatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activ ity, political unrest, civ il strife, acts of war , government shutdowns, product boycotts, trav el or immigration restrictions, tariffs and other trade restrictions, public health risks or pandemics, energy policy  or  restrictions,  public  corruption,  expropriation  and  other  economic  or  political  uncertainties,  including  inaccuracies  in  our  assumptions  about these factors, could interrupt and negativ ely affect our business operations or customer demand. For example, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East could impact demand for our products or result in increased supply chain costs or other cost impacts. High unemployment or the slowdown in economic growth in some markets could constrain consumer spending. Declining consumer purchasing power could result in loss of market share and adv ersely impact our profitability. The nature and degree of the v arious risks we face can also differ significantly among our regions and businesses.\n\nAll of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased rev enues and could materially and adv ersely affect our product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, stock price, and our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees in the short- or long-term.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  ris ks   from  changes   to  the  trade  policies   and  tariff  and  import/export  regulations   by  the  U.S.  and/or  other  foreign governments.\n\nChanges in the import and export policies, including trade restrictions, new or increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, sanctions and countersanctions, safeguards or customs restrictions by the U.S. and/or other foreign",

      "answer": "All three companies\u2014Colgate-Palmolive, Mondel\u0113z International, and Procter & Gamble\u2014identify counterfeit products as a significant risk to their brand equity and financial performance. Colgate-Palmolive emphasizes that counterfeit products are 'inferior or may pose safety risks,' potentially leading to consumer confusion and a decline in future purchases, which could 'adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.' Mondel\u0113z International similarly warns that counterfeit versions of its products could harm brand image and sales, noting that consumer confusion may result in a loss of trust and a reluctance to purchase their products in the future. Procter & Gamble expands on the reputational damage from counterfeit products, stating that such issues could 'substantially harm the reputation of our brands or the Company' and directly impact financial results. Each company underscores the importance of brand reputation and the potential for counterfeit goods to erode consumer confidence and future revenue.",

      "answer": "MDLZ highlights that geopolitical conditions, including the war in Ukraine and tensions between China and Taiwan, have exacerbated volatility in commodity prices and supply chains, affecting cocoa, dairy, and transportation. MO notes that current geopolitical conditions may materially impact the price, availability, and quality of raw materials, though the effect has not yet been material. PG explicitly details disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including reduced product portfolio in Russia, halted investments, and potential broader impacts on European markets due to inflation and supply chain costs. Together, these perspectives show that while all three are exposed to geopolitical risks, PG has experienced more direct operational impacts, whereas MDLZ and MO emphasize exposure primarily through input cost volatility.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of performance-based restricted stock unit (RSU) awards, with $26 million in total unrecognized compensation expense as of December 31, 2023. PepsiCo applies the Monte Carlo simulation model to value long-term cash awards tied to total shareholder return relative to peer companies, with 0.7 million and 1.3 million awards at target and maximum levels, respectively, as of December 30, 2023. Procter & Gamble utilizes the Monte Carlo model for performance stock units (PSUs), with assumptions closely aligned with those used for stock options, including volatility, exercise behavior, and interest rates. Collectively, these disclosures show that while all three companies rely on Monte Carlo simulation for complex performance-linked compensation, they differ in the structure, scale, and assumption alignment of their respective award programs.",

We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, geopolitical conditions (including international conflicts), local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and health crises.\n\nDespite the dynamic world in which we are currently operating, we believe we are well positioned to create value for our Company and our stakeholders. In an effort to support our future growth, we are continuing to invest in our portfolio of brands, our strategic capabilities and our people. We are focused on the following strategic priorities: shaping a portfolio of loved brands; transforming our marketing and innovation agenda; optimizing the Coca-Cola ecosystem; building talent and capabilities; and enhancing our license to operate.\n\n## Challenges and Risks\n\nBeing a global enterprise provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of our Company and the commercial beverage industry. Of these, six key strategic business challenges and risks are discussed below.\n\n## Obesity\n\nObesity continues to impact individuals, communities and countries worldwide. There is concern among consumers, public health professionals and governments about the health problems associated with obesity, which may present a challenge to our industry. We understand that obesity is a complex public health challenge, and we are committed to being a part of the solution.\n\nWe recognize the uniqueness of consumers' lifestyles and dietary choices. Therefore, we continue to do the following:\n\n- offer an ex panded portfolio of beverage choices, including reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverage options;\n- provide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of most of our packages;\n- provide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes, including small sizes to enable portion control; and\n- market responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 13.\n\nThe heritage of our Company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. As such, we are resolute in continuing to innovate and are committed to partnering with suppliers to invest in research and development of new noncaloric sweeteners and flavors that help us create the best tasting beverages, including options with low or no calories. We want to be a helpful and credible partner in the fight against obesity.\n\n## Evolving Consumer Product Preferences\n\nWe are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. As a consequence of these changes, many consumers want more beverage choices, personalization, a focus on sustainability, and transparency related to our products and packaging. We are committed to meeting changing consumer needs and to generating growth through our evolving portfolio of beverage brands and products (including numerous low- and no-calorie products); selectively expanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry; investing in innovative and sustainable packaging; and including easy-to-access information about our beverages on our website.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nYou should carefully read the follow ing discussion of significant factors, events and uncertainties w hen evaluating our business and the forw ard-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. While w e believe w e have identified and discussed below  the key risk factors affecting  our  business,  these  risk  factors  do  not  identify  all  the  risks  w e  face,  and  there  may  be  additional  risks  and  uncertainties  that  w e  do  not presently know  or that w e do not currently believe to be significant that may have a material adverse effect on our business, performance or financial condition  in  the  future.  In  addition  to  the  effects  of current  and  potential  trade  and  tariff  policies  and  resulting  global  impacts  on  our  business  and operations discussed in Item 7 of this Form 10-K and in the risk factors below , additional or unforeseen effects from these policies may give rise to or amplify many of these risks discussed below .\n\n## Strategic and Operational Risks\n\n## Commodity and other input prices are volatile and may increase or decrease significantly or availability of commodities may become constrained.\n\nWe purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including cocoa, dairy, wheat, edible oils, sugar and other sweeteners, flav oring agents and nuts. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of product packaging materials, natural gas, fuel and electricity for our factories and warehouses, and we also incur expenses in connection with labor and the transportation and deliv ery  of  our  products.  Costs  of  raw  materials,  energy  and  other supplies and serv ices are v olatile and fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict. T hese conditions include global competition for resources; tariffs or other trade barriers; currency fluctuations; geopolitical conditions or conflicts (including the ongoing war in Ukraine and international sanctions imposed on Russia for its inv asion of Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East and rising tensions between China and T aiwan); inflationary pressures related to  domestic  and  global  economic  conditions  or  supply  chain  issues;  transportation  and  labor  disruptions;  gov ernment  interv ention  to  introduce  liv ing income premiums or similar requirements; changes in env ironmental or trade policy and regulations, alternativ e energy and agricultural programs; sev ere weather;  agricultural  productiv ity;  crop  disease  or  pests;  water  risk;  health  pandemics;  forest  fires  and  other  natural  disasters;  acts  of  terrorism; geopolitical regional conflicts; cybersecurity incidents; supplier capacity; and consumer or industrial demand.  During 2024, price v olatility and higher aggregate  costs  were  driv en  by  a  confluence  of  factors:  disrupted  international  supply  chains,  labor  market  challenges,  soaring  commodity  prices (especially for cocoa beans) and increased transportation and labor costs. For additional information, see Item 7, Commodity Trends .\n\nMany of these conditions are or could be exacerbated or worsened by climate change.  Increased gov ernment interv ention and consumer or activ ist responses caused by increased focus on climate change, deforestation, water, plastic waste, animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the global food system could adv ersely affect our or our suppliers' reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business. Some commodities are grown by smallholder farmers who might not be able to inv est to increase productiv ity or adapt to changing conditions.\n\nOur efforts to monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against price increases cannot fully protect us from changes in input costs, including due to factors like changing import duties and tariffs, market illiquidity, specific local regulations and downstream costs. T hus, our hedging strategies have not always protected and will not in the future always protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Continued v olatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to ev olv e our product and packaging portfolio  could  increase  or  decrease  the  costs  of  our  products,  and  our  profitability  could  suffer  as  a  result.  Moreov er ,  increases  in  the  price  of  our products, including increases to cov er inflation and higher input, packaging and transportation costs, may result in lower sales v olumes or customer delistings, while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our rev enues, profits or margins. Likewise, constraints in the supply or av ailability of key commodities and necessary serv ices like transportation may limit our ability to grow our net rev enues and earnings. If our mitigation activ ities are not effectiv e, if we are unable to price to cov er increased costs (including if we are delayed in our ability to raise prices or unable to raise the prices of our products enough to keep up with the rate of inflation), if we must reduce our prices, if increased prices affect demand for our products (including  if  consumers  forego  purchasing  certain  of  our  products  or  switch  to  'priv ate  label'  or  lower-priced  product  offerings),  or  if  we  are limited  by  supply  or  distribution  constraints,  our  financial  condition,  results  of  operations,  cash  flows  and  stock  price  can  be  materially  adv ersely affected.",

We believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch among tobacco categories, use multiple forms of tobacco products and try innovative tobacco products, such as e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches. As innovative smoke-free products evolve to better address the preferences of adult tobacco consumers, these consumers continue to transition from cigarettes and MST products to exclusive use of innovative smoke-free tobacco product alternatives, which aligns with our Vision. As a result, long-term trends in the overall nicotine space are improving. Industry equivalized nicotine volumes increased for the second consecutive year in 2024 and grew by a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 2% over the past five years.\n\nWe work to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences over time by developing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing products both within and outside the United States through innovation and other growth strategies (including, where appropriate, arrangements with, or investments in, third parties and acquisitions).\n\nWe estimate that, when adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, total estimated domestic cigarette industry volume declined by 8% in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 9% for the full year. PM USA reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 8.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 10.2% for the full year. When adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, PM USA volumes for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the full year each declined by an estimated 11%. In the fourth quarter, Marlboro share of the total cigarette category was 41.3%, a decrease of 1.0 share point versus the prior year and 0.3 share points in the fourth quarter. Marlboro share performance is discussed further in the Operating Results - Smokeable Products Segment below.\n\nWe have been monitoring shifts in adult tobacco consumer preferences and their effects on cigarette industry decline rates. As a result, we believe that the decline in adult smokers, excluding any cross category movement, resulted in an estimated 2.5% decline in cigarette industry volume over the 12 months ended December 31, 2024. We estimate that cross-category movement contributed to cigarette industry volume declines in a range of approximately 3% to 4% over the 12 months ended December 31, 2024.\n\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, we estimate the e-vapor category grew approximately 30% versus the prior 12-month period, driven by the growth of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products. We estimate that illicit products now represent more than 60% of the e-vapor category. These illicit disposable e-vapor products are largely distributed through non-traditional retail channels (including e-commerce and vape retail channels), making them more difficult to track. In addition, we believe illicit cigarettes are becoming more prevalent in the United States, based on the results of discarded pack studies we conducted in select geographies. We believe the FDA's inadequate enforcement and slow pace of smoke-free product authorizations enables bad actors to disregard regulation and illicit products to proliferate. Through our competitive intelligence tracking, we continue to monitor these growing trends and evaluate the impacts on the overall nicotine and tobacco categories.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, reported shipment volume of NJOY consumables (including NJOY ACE and NJOY DAILY ) was approximately 12.8 million units, and NJOY device shipment volume was approximately 1.1 million units. The NJOY share of the pod-based e-vapor category reached 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of 0.2 share points sequentially and 2.8 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe U.S. nicotine pouch category continued to grow significantly throughout the fourth quarter of 2024 to 45.7% of the U.S. oral tobacco category, an increase of 9.6 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023. on! maintained year-over-year share momentum through the fourth quarter of 2024 to achieve 8.9% of the total oral tobacco category, an increase of 2.0 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023 and unchanged sequentially.\n\nFor the fourth quarter 2024, the traditional smokeless category (including MST) share of the total oral tobacco category declined to 54.3%, down 9.6 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Copenhagen had an oral tobacco category share of 18.1% for the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of 3.6 share points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. We continue to track the growth of nicotine pouch volumes and the related impact on the size of the MST category. Decreases in the size of the MST category could impact the carrying value of our assets, such as our smokeless tobacco product goodwill and trademarks. For example, in the second quarter of 2024, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment on the value of the Skoal trademark.\n\nThroughout the full year 2024, U.S. adult tobacco consumers remained under pressure largely due to the compounding effects of high prices exceeding overall wage growth. In addition, consumer credit and credit card delinquency rates rose to the highest levels since 2011 in the first half of 2024. While recent reports indicate that consumer credit and delinquency rates are beginning to moderate, these rates remain at historically high levels. Although the monthly rate of inflation stabilized during the year, headwinds continued for U.S. adult tobacco consumers. Gas prices throughout the fourth quarter of 2024 experienced seasonal declines, averaging $3.02 per gallon for the month of December 2024. While gas prices were lower than in the prior year, they remained consistently above $3.00 per gallon throughout 2024.",

RISK FACTORS\n\nIn addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report, set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities. These risks, some of which have occurred and/or are occurring and any of which could occur in the future, are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.\n\n## Business and Industry Risks\n\n## We face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nWe operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately 70% of our Net sales originating in markets outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we face risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:\n\n- changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of inflation, volatile commodity prices and increases in the cost of raw and packaging materials, labor, energy and logistics;\n- political or economic instability, geopolitical events, environmental events, widespread health emergencies, such as COVID19 or other pandemics or epidemics, natural disasters or social or labor unrest;\n- changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows from non-U.S. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars, in those markets;\n- exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import or export raw materials or finished product, including as a result of COVID-19, or to repatriate earnings from overseas;\n- lack of well-established, reliable and/or impartial legal systems in certain countries where we operate and difficulties in enforcing contractual, intellectual property or other legal rights;\n- foreign ownership and investment restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources; and\n- changes to trade policies and agreements and other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of and/or the increase in onerous trade restrictions and/or tariffs, sanctions, price controls, labor laws, travel or immigration restrictions, including as a result of COVID-19 or other pandemics or epidemics, profit controls or other government controls.\n\nAny or all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings.\n\nIn addition, there continue to be uncertainties related to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union ('EU') (commonly referred to as Brexit), including the long-term impact of the bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU (the 'EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement'). These uncertainties include the impact of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on businesses in the EU and the United Kingdom and how the new relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom will develop over time, including disruptions to trade and the free movement of goods, services and people to and from the United Kingdom, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the British pound and/or the euro and disruptions to our workforce and that of",

Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions), monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights.\n\n## Changes  in  accounting  standards  and  subjective  assumptions,  estimates  and  judgments  by  management related  to  complex  accounting  matters  could  significantly  affect  our  financial  condition  and  results  of operations.\n\nAccounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including self-insurance liabilities, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying  assumptions,  estimates  or  judgments  by  our  management  could  significantly  change  our  reported  or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## We are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\nSection  404  of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act  of  2002  requires  management  assessments  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.\n\n## Changes in tax rates, new U.S. or foreign tax legislation, and exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally,  at  any  point  in  time,  we  may  be  under  examination  for  value  added,  sales-based,  payroll, product,  import  or  other  non-income  taxes.  We  may  recognize  additional  tax  expense,  be  subject  to  additional  tax liabilities,  or  incur  losses  and  penalties,  due  to  changes  in  laws,  regulations,  administrative  practices,  principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries,  a  change  in  earnings  attributable  to  the  various  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate  could  result  in  an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Significant  changes  in  or  failure  to  comply  with  regulations  relating  to  the  use,  storage,  discharge  and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are  subject  to  a  wide  and  increasingly  broad  array  of  federal,  state,  regional,  local  and  international  laws  and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes  and  other  environmental  matters.  Failure  to  comply  with  these  laws  could  result  in  harm  to  our  members, employees or others, significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or  the  imposition  of  severe  penalties  or  restrictions  on  operations  by  governmental  agencies  or  courts  that  could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",

The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. During 2021, we experienced higher than anticipated transportation and commodity costs, which we expect to continue in 2022. A number of external factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse weather  conditions,  supply  chain  disruptions  (including  raw  material  shortages)  and  labor  shortages,  have impacted  and  may  continue  to  impact  transportation  and  commodity  availability  and  costs.  When  prices increase,  we  may  or  may  not  pass  on  such  increases  to  our  customers  without  suffering  reduced  volume, revenue, margins and operating results.\n\nSee Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices.\n\n## Risks Associated with Climate Change\n\nCertain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or  are  considering imposing, new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing  programs.  These  new  or  increased  legal  or  regulatory  requirements  could  result  in  significant increased costs of compliance and additional investments in facilities and equipment. However, we are unable to  predict  the  scope,  nature  and  timing  of  any  new  or  increased  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. We continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations.\n\n## Risks Associated with International Operations\n\nWe are subject to risks in the normal course of business that are inherent to international operations. During the  periods  presented  in  this  report,  certain  jurisdictions  in  which  our  products  are  made,  manufactured, distributed  or  sold,  including  in  certain  developing  and  emerging  markets,  operated  in  a  challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and  political  environment  in  these  markets  closely  and  to  identify  actions  to  potentially  mitigate  any unfavorable impacts on our future results.\n\n## Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products\n\nCertain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging,  commodities  used  in  the  production  of  our  products  or  their  packaging  or  the  recyclability  or recoverability  of  our  packaging.  These  taxes  and  regulations  vary  in  scope  and  form.  For  example,  some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in increased regulatory focus on labeling in certain jurisdictions, including in Mexico which enacted product labeling requirements and limitations on the marketing of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging,",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, geopolitical conditions (including international conflicts), local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and health crises.\n\nDespite the dynamic world in which we are currently operating, we believe we are well positioned to create value for our Company and our stakeholders. In an effort to support our future growth, we are continuing to invest in our portfolio of brands, our strategic capabilities and our people. We are focused on the following strategic priorities: shaping a portfolio of loved brands; transforming our marketing and innovation agenda; optimizing the Coca-Cola ecosystem; building talent and capabilities; and enhancing our license to operate.\n\n## Challenges and Risks\n\nBeing a global enterprise provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of our Company and the commercial beverage industry. Of these, six key strategic business challenges and risks are discussed below.\n\n## Obesity\n\nObesity continues to impact individuals, communities and countries worldwide. There is concern among consumers, public health professionals and governments about the health problems associated with obesity, which may present a challenge to our industry. We understand that obesity is a complex public health challenge, and we are committed to being a part of the solution.\n\nWe recognize the uniqueness of consumers' lifestyles and dietary choices. Therefore, we continue to do the following:\n\n- offer an ex panded portfolio of beverage choices, including reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverage options;\n- provide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of most of our packages;\n- provide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes, including small sizes to enable portion control; and\n- market responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 13.\n\nThe heritage of our Company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. As such, we are resolute in continuing to innovate and are committed to partnering with suppliers to invest in research and development of new noncaloric sweeteners and flavors that help us create the best tasting beverages, including options with low or no calories. We want to be a helpful and credible partner in the fight against obesity.\n\n## Evolving Consumer Product Preferences\n\nWe are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. As a consequence of these changes, many consumers want more beverage choices, personalization, a focus on sustainability, and transparency related to our products and packaging. We are committed to meeting changing consumer needs and to generating growth through our evolving portfolio of beverage brands and products (including numerous low- and no-calorie products); selectively expanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry; investing in innovative and sustainable packaging; and including easy-to-access information about our beverages on our website.",

Additionally, these and other economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third-party partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles. In addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient sales, income and cash flow , it could affect the Company's ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments.\n\n## Changing political and geopolitical conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results.\n\nChanges in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, as well as changing geopolitical conditions, may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results. Results of elections, referendums, sanctions or other political processes and pressures in certain markets in which our products are manufactured, sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, taxes, tariffs, import and ex port controls and the general movement of goods, materials, services, capital, data and people between countries. The potential implications of such uncertainty, which include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations, new or increased tariffs, trade barriers and market contraction, could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and cash flows.\n\nThe Company operates a global business with sales, manufacturing, distribution and research and development organizations globally that contribute to our overall growth. If geopolitical tensions and trade controls were to increase or disrupt our business in markets where we have significant sales or operations, including disruptions due to governmental responses to such conflicts (such as the imposition of sanctions, export controls, retaliatory tariffs, increased business licensing requirements or limitations on profits), such disruptions could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nOur  business,  operations  or  employees  have  been  and  could  continue  to  be  adversely  affected  (including  by  the  need  to  de-consolidate  or  even  ex it  certain businesses in particular countries) by geopolitical conflicts, political volatility, trade controls, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions. This could include political instability, upheaval or acts of war and the related responses of governments or other entities (including, but not limited  to,  boycotts  in  certain  regions),  broad  economic  instability  or  sovereign  risk  related  to  a  default  by  or  deterioration  in  the  creditworthiness  of  local governments, particularly in emerging markets.\n\nFor example, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted, and the situation it generates may continue to negatively impact, our operations. Beginning in March 2022, the Company reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new capital investments and suspended media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia. Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty as to how the overall situation will evolve. We may reduce  further  or  discontinue  our  operations  in  Russia  due  to  sanctions  and  ex port  controls  and  counter-sanctions,  monetary,  currency  or  payment  controls, restrictions on access to financial institutions, supply and transportation challenges or other circumstances and considerations. Ultimately, these could result in loss of assets or impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed assets or write-downs of other operating assets and working capital.\n\nMore broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings and cash flows should the situation worsen, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures, energy and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe.\n\nChanges in geopolitical conditions could also amplify or affect the other risk factors set forth in this Part I, Item 1A, including, but not limited to, foreign ex change volatility,  disruptions to the financial and credit markets, energy supply and supply chain disruptions, increased risks of an information security or operational technology incident, cost fluctuations and commodity cost increases and increased costs to ensure compliance with global and local laws and regulations.\n\n## Disruptions in credit markets or to our banking partners or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit or overall liquidity.\n\nA disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. In addition, we rely on top-tier banking partners in key markets around the world, who themselves face economic, societal, political and other risks, for access to credit and to facilitate collection, payment and supply chain finance programs. A disruption to one or more of these top-tier partners could impact our ability to draw on existing credit facilities or otherwise adversely affect our cash flows or the cash flows of our customers and vendors.\n\n## BUSINESS OPERATIONS RISKS\n\n## Our business results depend on our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain.\n\nOur ability  to  meet  our  customers'  needs  and  achieve  cost  targets  depends  on  our  ability  to  maintain  key  manufacturing  and  supply  arrangements,  including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. The loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes or controversies, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity or disruptions in our internal information",

In contrast, Philip Morris noted a 26.2% decline in cigarette and HTU shipment volume in the Philippines, which partially offset growth in other markets like Turkey.

          "chunk_text": "We generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as 'structural changes,' which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company's unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's acquisitions and divestitures.\n\n'Acquired brands' refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.\n\n'Licensed brands' refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.\n\nIn January 2023, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Vietnam. The impact of this refranchising has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments. In January, February and December 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in certain territories in India, and in February 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Bangladesh and the Philippines. The impact of each of these refranchisings has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments.\n\nIn May 2023, the Company acquired certain brands in Asia Pacific. The impact of acquiring these brands has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Asia Pacific operating segment.\n\n## Beverage Volume\n\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, 'unit case' means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and 'unit case volume' means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.",

In contrast, Target (TGT) does not directly disclose the content or public availability of its code of business conduct and ethics in the provided evidence, instead incorporating by reference portions of its Proxy Statement without specifying the scope of employee coverage or online accessibility.

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions; erosion of consumer confidence; competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products; adult smoker willingness to convert to our SFPs; higher product taxes; higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories; unfair competition; and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products, restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our SFPs, or disproportionately impacts the commercialization of our products in relation to our competitors.\n\nCompetitors in our industry include Altria G roup, Inc., British American Tobacco plc, Japan Tobacco Inc., Imperial Brands plc, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, China,  Taiwan,  Thailand  and  V ietnam.  Some  competitors  have  different  profit,  volume  and  regulatory  objectives,  some  international  competitors  may  be  less susceptible than  PMI to changes in currency exchange rates, and some competitors may sell products in circumvention of applicable regulations that compete directly  with  our  products.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative  products  through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior product satisfaction, and without scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our SFPs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. See Item 1, Business-Competition for a description of the competitive environment in which we operate.\n\n## We may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences.\n\nOur  business  is  subject  to  changes  in  adult  consumer  preferences,  which  may  be  influenced  by  local  economic  conditions,  accessibility  to  our  products  and availability of accurate information related to our products.\n\n## To be successful, we must:\n\n- promote brand equity successfully;\n- anticipate and respond to new adult consumer trends;\n- ensure that our products meet our quality standards;\n- develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios;\n- improve productivity;\n- educate and encourage adult smokers to convert to our SFPs;\n- ensure effective adult consumer engagement, including communication about product characteristics and usage of SFPs;\n- mitigate the impact of developments that cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands;\n- provide excellent customer care;\n- ensure adequate production capacity to meet demand for our products; and\n- be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases.\n\nIn periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may tend to purchase low-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could be materially adversely impacted as a result. Such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation. In addition to economic uncertainty (including recessions and inflation) unusual weather events and global or local epidemics, endemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19) has and may change the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for our mid-price or premium-price brands.\n\n## Our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets, maintain sufficient production capacity, or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.\n\nOur profit growth may be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to meet the demand for our products with increased production capacity, to raise prices, or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nWhen deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk. All derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid ex penses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The cash flow impact of the Company's derivative instruments is primarily included in our consolidated statement of cash flows in net cash provided by operating activities. Refer to Note 5.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at its inception based on whether or not the Company has the right to control the asset during the contract period and other facts and circumstances. We are the lessee in a lease contract when we obtain the right to control the asset. Operating lease right-of-use ('ROU') assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease and are included in the line items accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. When determining the lease term, we include renewal or termination options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in our consolidated statement of income. As the rates implicit in our leases are not readily determinable, we use our local incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. When our contracts contain lease and non-lease components, we account for both components as a single lease component. Refer to Note 10.\n\nWe have various contracts for certain fountain equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend economic life are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is recorded principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets, which are reviewed periodically and generally have the following ranges: buildings and improvements: 40 years or less; and machinery and equipment: 20 years or less. Land is not depreciated, and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term, including renewal options that we are reasonably certain to exercise, or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Depreciation is not recorded during the period in which a long-lived asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale, even if the asset or disposal group continues to generate revenue during the period. Depreciation expense, including the depreciation expense of assets under finance leases, totaled $997 million, $1,018 million and $1,125 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Amortization expense for leasehold improvements totaled $17 million, $14 million and $13 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.",

          "chunk_text": "## Income taxes\n\nIncome  taxes  are  provided  on  all  earnings  for  jurisdictions  outside  the  United  States. These  provisions,  as  well  as  state  and  local  income  tax   provisions,  are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in PMI's consolidated balance sheets. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. PMI recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the  provision  for  income  tax es  on  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings. PMI  recognizes  income  tax es  associated  with  G lobal  Intangible  Low-Tax ed  Income (\"GILTI\") taxes as current period expense rather than including these amounts in the measurement of deferred taxes.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The first-in, first-out and average cost methods are used to cost substantially all inventories. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset, although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the aging process, ordinarily would not be utilized within one year.\n\n## Leases\n\nPMI determines that a contract contains a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange  for consideration. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is amortized based on production activity or the  lease  term. Lease ex pense is recorded in cost of sales or marketing, administration and research costs depending on the nature of the leased item. At lease commencement, PMI recognizes lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets (at the present value of future payments) for predominately all of its leases. The recognition of the right-of-use asset and lease liability includes renewal options when it is reasonably certain that they will be ex ercised. Certain of PMI's leases include payments that are based on changes to an index or on actual usage. These lease payments are adjusted periodically and are included within variable lease costs. PMI accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single-lease component with the exception of its vehicle leases, of which PMI accounts for the lease components separately from the nonlease components. Additionally, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability on the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Marketing costs\n\nPMI supports its products with advertising, adult consumer engagement and trade promotions. Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, rebates, instore display incentives, e-commerce, mobile and other digital platforms, adult consumer activation and promotion activities, as well as costs associated with adult consumer experience outlets and other adult consumer touchpoints and volume-based incentives. Advertising, as well as certain consumer engagement and trade activities costs, are ex pensed as incurred. Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers at the end of a period, based principally on historical utilization. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and certain consumer engagement expenses are charged to earnings based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nPMI recognizes revenue primarily through the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products. The majority of PMI revenues are generated by sales through direct and indirect distribution networks with short-term payment conditions and where control is typically transferred to the customer either upon shipment or delivery of goods. PMI evaluates the transfer of control through evidence of the customer's receipt and acceptance, transfer of title, PMI's right to payment for those products and the customer's ability to direct the use of those products upon receipt.  Typically, PMI's performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of goods.\n\nIn certain instances, PMI facilitates shipping and handling activities after control has transferred to the customer. PMI has elected to record all shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill a contract. The shipping and handling costs that have not been incurred at the time revenue is recognized are accrued.  PMI is a principal for majority of its arrangements and recognizes revenue at the transaction price, with the associated costs recorded in cost of sales. The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration, where applicable. Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers, historical experience of discount or rebate redemption, where relevant, and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories  evolve. For arrangements where PMI acts as an agent, the net commission earned is recognized as revenue. PMI has elected to exclude excise taxes collected from customers from the measurement of the transaction price, thereby presenting revenues net of excise taxes. Estimated costs associated with warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.",

PEP discloses a significant supplier relationship with Walmart, noting that sales to Walmart and its affiliates accounted for approximately 14% of its consolidated net revenue in 2024, indicating a material dependency. TGT, however, does not directly mention Walmart in its 2024 10-K filing, suggesting that either Walmart is not a material competitor or partner to TGT, or that TGT does not view Walmart as a focal point in its current market strategy.

In addition, we exclude from  net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by governm ent authorities on revenue producing transactions.\n\nThe transfer of control of products to our custom ers is typically based on written sales term s that generally do not allow for a right of return, except i n  th e i n stan ce of  a product recal l  or other l i m i ted ci rcum stances that m ay al l ow f or product returns. Our pol i cy for DSD, i ncl udi ng certai n chi l l ed products, is to rem ove and replace dam aged and out-of-date products from  store shelves to ensure that consum ers receive the product quality and freshness they expect.  Sim ilarly , our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace dam aged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estim ates, for product recall, anticipated dam aged and out-of-date products.\n\nOur products are sold for cash or on credit term s.

      "question": "How do Altria (MO), Target (TGT), and Walmart (WMT) each address the evolving landscape of information security laws, and what does this reveal about their respective risk exposure and compliance strategies in the consumer staples sector?",
      "answer": "Altria (MO) emphasizes the increasing complexity of global and regional information security laws and the challenges of maintaining compliance across jurisdictions, particularly with evolving artificial intelligence technologies. Target (TGT) highlights information security laws as part of a broader set of regulatory risks that could increase operating costs and affect business operations, especially in areas like data privacy and cybersecurity. Walmart (WMT) focuses on the operational and contractual implications of data security standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, and the potential liability from breaches involving payment card data. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are exposed to regulatory risk from information security laws, they differ in how they frame and manage these risks\u2014MO through compliance complexity, TGT through cost and operational impact, and WMT through contractual and financial liability.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) highlights that exchange controls and other limits on importing raw materials or finished products, particularly due to geopolitical conflicts like the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, pose a significant risk to its international operations. Coca-Cola (KO) notes that import authorization requirements and other trade restrictions, which may be imposed or expanded due to political and economic instability, could negatively impact its profitability. Mondelez (MDLZ) specifically mentions exposure to the imposition of new or increased tariffs, export controls, quotas, and trade barriers, and emphasizes the impact such restrictions could have on its sales or key commodities like cocoa. Collectively, these disclosures show that while all three companies face regulatory risks from import restrictions, the nature and emphasis of these risks differ based on their global footprint and product supply chains.",

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola (KO), Mondelez (MDLZ), and Walmart (WMT) each quantify the potential financial impact of statute of limitations expirations on their unrecognized tax benefits, and what does this reveal about the relative volatility of their uncertain tax positions?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) indicates that changes in unrecognized tax benefits due to statute of limitations expirations may occur within the next 12 months, though it cannot estimate the range of outcomes. Mondelez (MDLZ) specifies that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately $65 million within the next year due to statute expirations. Walmart (WMT) reports that in fiscal 2024, $29 million of unrecognized tax benefits were reduced due to the lapse in statutes of limitations. Comparing these figures, Mondelez provides the most concrete estimate of the potential reduction, while Coca-Cola avoids quantification entirely, suggesting higher uncertainty. Walmart\u2019s historical disclosure shows a smaller but consistent impact from statute expirations. This reveals that Mondelez has more visibility into its tax exposure, whereas Coca-Cola faces higher unpredictability in its uncertain tax positions.",

Coca-Cola refranchised its bottling operations in Vietnam in January 2023, signaling a strategic shift in its operational model in the country. PepsiCo reported high-single-digit beverage volume growth in Vietnam, showing strong consumer demand and market traction.

          "chunk_text": "We generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as 'structural changes,' which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company's unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's acquisitions and divestitures.\n\n'Acquired brands' refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.\n\n'Licensed brands' refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.\n\nIn January 2023, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Vietnam. The impact of this refranchising has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments. In January, February and December 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in certain territories in India, and in February 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Bangladesh and the Philippines. The impact of each of these refranchisings has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments.\n\nIn May 2023, the Company acquired certain brands in Asia Pacific. The impact of acquiring these brands has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Asia Pacific operating segment.\n\n## Beverage Volume\n\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, 'unit case' means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and 'unit case volume' means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) highlights nationalization as a risk among several geopolitical and regulatory risks in its international operations, without specifying particular countries or financial exposure. Mondelez International (MDLZ) notes nationalization as part of sovereign risk in emerging markets, with specific mention of Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye where it has applied inflationary accounting, indicating a more concrete operational impact. Philip Morris International (PM) provides the most detailed exposure, noting that Russia accounted for 9% of its total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume and 6% of total net revenues in 2023, and that it faces a heightened risk of nationalization or asset deprivation in Russia due to the Ukraine conflict.

PepsiCo indicates that volatile geopolitical conditions have made financial estimates\u2014such as those related to asset impairments, pension accruals, and future cash flows\u2014more difficult to calculate, increasing financial uncertainty. Procter & Gamble emphasizes that geopolitical conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, have disrupted supply chains, increased cost volatility, and created risks of asset impairments or write-downs, particularly in regions affected by sanctions and trade controls. Together, these companies show a shared concern over the financial and operational risks posed by geopolitical instability, though each emphasizes different aspects: MO focuses on asset impairments, PEP on financial estimate volatility, and PG on supply chain and regional exposure risks.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- the proliferation of products using nicotine analogues that are designed to imitate the effects of nicotine but are not subject to the FDA regulatory framework for tobacco products; and\n- potential adverse changes in prices, availability and quality of tobacco, other raw materials and component parts, including as a result of changes in macroeconomic, geopolitical and climate and environmental conditions.\n\nIn addition to and in connection with the foregoing, evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences continue to impact the tobacco industry, including negatively impacting cigarette and MST shipment volumes. We believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch among tobacco categories, use multiple forms of tobacco products and try innovative tobacco products, such as e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches. As innovative smoke-free products evolve to better address the preferences of adult tobacco consumers, these consumers continue to transition from cigarettes and MST products to exclusive use of innovative smoke-free tobacco product alternatives, which aligns with our Vision. As a result, long-term trends in the overall nicotine space are improving. Industry equivalized nicotine volumes increased for the second consecutive year in 2024 and grew by a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 2% over the past five years.\n\nWe work to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences over time by developing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing products both within and outside the United States through innovation and other growth strategies (including, where appropriate, arrangements with, or investments in, third parties and acquisitions).\n\nWe estimate that, when adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, total estimated domestic cigarette industry volume declined by 8% in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 9% for the full year. PM USA reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 8.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 10.2% for the full year. When adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, PM USA volumes for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the full year each declined by an estimated 11%. In the fourth quarter, Marlboro share of the total cigarette category was 41.3%, a decrease of 1.0 share point versus the prior year and 0.3 share points in the fourth quarter. Marlboro share performance is discussed further in the Operating Results - Smokeable Products Segment below.\n\nWe have been monitoring shifts in adult tobacco consumer preferences and their effects on cigarette industry decline rates. As a result, we believe that the decline in adult smokers, excluding any cross category movement, resulted in an estimated 2.5% decline in cigarette industry volume over the 12 months ended December 31, 2024. We estimate that cross-category movement contributed to cigarette industry volume declines in a range of approximately 3% to 4% over the 12 months ended December 31, 2024.\n\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, we estimate the e-vapor category grew approximately 30% versus the prior 12-month period, driven by the growth of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products. We estimate that illicit products now represent more than 60% of the e-vapor category. These illicit disposable e-vapor products are largely distributed through non-traditional retail channels (including e-commerce and vape retail channels), making them more difficult to track. In addition, we believe illicit cigarettes are becoming more prevalent in the United States, based on the results of discarded pack studies we conducted in select geographies. We believe the FDA's inadequate enforcement and slow pace of smoke-free product authorizations enables bad actors to disregard regulation and illicit products to proliferate. Through our competitive intelligence tracking, we continue to monitor these growing trends and evaluate the impacts on the overall nicotine and tobacco categories.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, reported shipment volume of NJOY consumables (including NJOY ACE and NJOY DAILY ) was approximately 12.8 million units, and NJOY device shipment volume was approximately 1.1 million units. The NJOY share of the pod-based e-vapor category reached 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of 0.2 share points sequentially and 2.8 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe U.S. nicotine pouch category continued to grow significantly throughout the fourth quarter of 2024 to 45.7% of the U.S. oral tobacco category, an increase of 9.6 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023. on! maintained year-over-year share momentum through the fourth quarter of 2024 to achieve 8.9% of the total oral tobacco category, an increase of 2.0 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023 and unchanged sequentially.\n\nFor the fourth quarter 2024, the traditional smokeless category (including MST) share of the total oral tobacco category declined to 54.3%, down 9.6 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Copenhagen had an oral tobacco category share of 18.1% for the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of 3.6 share points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. We continue to track the growth of nicotine pouch volumes and the related impact on the size of the MST category. Decreases in the size of the MST category could impact the carrying value of our assets, such as our smokeless tobacco product goodwill and trademarks. For example, in the second quarter of 2024, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment on the value of the Skoal trademark.\n\nThroughout the full year 2024, U.S. adult tobacco consumers remained under pressure largely due to the compounding effects of high prices exceeding overall wage growth. In addition, consumer credit and credit card delinquency rates rose to the highest levels since 2011 in the first half of 2024. While recent reports indicate that consumer credit and delinquency rates are beginning to moderate, these rates remain at historically high levels. Although the monthly rate of inflation stabilized during the year, headwinds continued for U.S. adult tobacco consumers. Gas prices throughout the fourth quarter of 2024 experienced seasonal declines, averaging $3.02 per gallon for the month of December 2024. While gas prices were lower than in the prior year, they remained consistently above $3.00 per gallon throughout 2024.",

If geopolitical tensions and trade controls were to increase or disrupt our business in markets where we have significant sales or operations, including disruptions due to governmental responses to such conflicts (such as the imposition of sanctions, export controls, retaliatory tariffs, increased business licensing requirements or limitations on profits), such disruptions could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nOur  business,  operations  or  employees  have  been  and  could  continue  to  be  adversely  affected  (including  by  the  need  to  de-consolidate  or  even  ex it  certain businesses in particular countries) by geopolitical conflicts, political volatility, trade controls, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions. This could include political instability, upheaval or acts of war and the related responses of governments or other entities (including, but not limited  to,  boycotts  in  certain  regions),  broad  economic  instability  or  sovereign  risk  related  to  a  default  by  or  deterioration  in  the  creditworthiness  of  local governments, particularly in emerging markets.\n\nFor example, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted, and the situation it generates may continue to negatively impact, our operations. Beginning in March 2022, the Company reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new capital investments and suspended media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia. Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty as to how the overall situation will evolve. We may reduce  further  or  discontinue  our  operations  in  Russia  due  to  sanctions  and  ex port  controls  and  counter-sanctions,  monetary,  currency  or  payment  controls, restrictions on access to financial institutions, supply and transportation challenges or other circumstances and considerations. Ultimately, these could result in loss of assets or impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed assets or write-downs of other operating assets and working capital.\n\nMore broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings and cash flows should the situation worsen, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures, energy and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe.\n\nChanges in geopolitical conditions could also amplify or affect the other risk factors set forth in this Part I, Item 1A, including, but not limited to, foreign ex change volatility,  disruptions to the financial and credit markets, energy supply and supply chain disruptions, increased risks of an information security or operational technology incident, cost fluctuations and commodity cost increases and increased costs to ensure compliance with global and local laws and regulations.\n\n## Disruptions in credit markets or to our banking partners or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit or overall liquidity.\n\nA disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. In addition, we rely on top-tier banking partners in key markets around the world, who themselves face economic, societal, political and other risks, for access to credit and to facilitate collection, payment and supply chain finance programs. A disruption to one or more of these top-tier partners could impact our ability to draw on existing credit facilities or otherwise adversely affect our cash flows or the cash flows of our customers and vendors.\n\n## BUSINESS OPERATIONS RISKS\n\n## Our business results depend on our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain.\n\nOur ability  to  meet  our  customers'  needs  and  achieve  cost  targets  depends  on  our  ability  to  maintain  key  manufacturing  and  supply  arrangements,  including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. The loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes or controversies, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity or disruptions in our internal information",

Ongoing public concern about obesity; other health-related public concerns surrounding consumption of sweetened beverages; the effects or perceived effects of the usage of weight-loss drugs on consumption patterns; potential new or increased taxes on sweetened beverages by government entities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue; potential new or increased governmental regulations on particular ingredients or additives in our beverages and packaging, or on manufacturing processes; additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our sweetened beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sweetened beverages may reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, our sweetened beverages, which could adversely affect our profitability.\n\n## If we do not address evolving consumer product and shopping preferences, our business could suffer.\n\nConsumer product preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sweetened beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients or processing; concerns regarding the perceived health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients, raw materials or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of thirdparty studies (whether or not scientifically valid); shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer tastes and needs coupled with a rapid expansion of beverage options and delivery methods; changes in consumer lifestyles; concerns regarding the environmental, social and sustainability impact of ingredient sources, the product manufacturing process and our packaging; consumer emphasis on transparency related to ingredients we use in our products and collection and recyclability of, and amount of recycled content contained in, our packaging containers and other materials; concerns about the health and welfare of animals in our dairy supply chain; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, in many of our markets, shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with consumers rapidly embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms. If we fail to address changes in consumer product and shopping preferences, do not successfully anticipate and prepare for future changes in such preferences, or are ineffective or slow in developing and implementing appropriate digital transformation initiatives, our share of sales, revenue growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.\n\n## Product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.\n\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards that we expect our operations, bottling partners and contract manufacturers to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our bottling partners at times have not met, and may not always meet, these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions into beverage categories, such as value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, that are beyond our traditional range of beverage products. We and our bottling partners have had, and may in the future need, to recall products if they become contaminated or adulterated by any means, or if they are mislabeled or do not meet applicable regulatory requirements. In addition, we or our bottling partners and products have been, and could continue to be, subject to inspection by federal, state and local authorities, which could result in the identification of product quality or safety issues. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time, and could also subject us to product liability claims and negative publicity, all of which could cause our business to suffer.\n\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of processing and of certain ingredients, such as nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners, color additives and biotechnology-derived substances, and of other substances present in our beverage products or packaging materials, may reduce demand for our beverage products or result in additional governmental regulation.\n\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of processing and of certain ingredients in our beverage products, such as synthetic colors, nutritive (e.g., sugar, HFCS) and non-nutritive sweeteners, biotechnology-derived substances and other additives; substances that are present in our beverage products naturally or that occur as a result of the manufacturing process, such as 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI), a chemical compound that is formed during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring used in cola-flavored beverages; or substances used in packaging materials, such as bisphenol A (BPA), an odorless, tasteless food-grade chemical commonly used in the food and beverage industries as a component in the coating of the interior of cans, may affect consumers' preferences and cause them to shift away from some of our beverage",

Certain impacts of physical risk may include: temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers; ex treme weather patterns that affect the production or sourcing of certain commodities; flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory; disruption of electrical grids or utilities required to operate our stores, clubs and information systems; and heat and extreme weather events that cause long-term disruption or threats to the habitability of the communities in which we operate. Relative to transition risk, certain impacts may include: changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate-related weather events; prolonged climate-related events affecting macroeconomic conditions with related effects on consumer spending and confidence; stakeholder perception of our engagement in climate-related policies; and new regulatory requirements resulting in higher compliance risk and operational costs.\n\nWe bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers; theft, loss or spoilage of inventory; and business interruption caused by such events.

Moreover, our operations in the U.S. comprise a significant portion of our financial and operational performance. Therefore, any of the above matters that uniquely impact or are specifically concentrated in the U.S. could materially adversely affect our financial and operational performance.\n\n## Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner and in the large volumes we may demand, are significant challenges, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.\n\nPolitical and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances (such as we previously experienced (and could experience again) with the pandemic recovery related challenges, including supply chain disruption and production, labor shortages and increases in labor costs) in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located or regions goods are transported from or through, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers not having the financial ability or capacity to fulfill their indemnification obligations to us if called upon, thereby ex posing us to the full cost of risks and claims, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, ex treme weather events impacting the growing, manufacturing, mining and harvesting of commodities and products, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs and other facilities, including as a result of ex treme weather or labor slowdowns and/or strikes at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.\n\nIn addition, U.S. and international trade policies, tariffs, trade barriers and other restrictions on the ex portation and importation of goods, trade sanctions imposed between certain countries and entities, the limitation on the ex portation or importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers, our access to products and our access to service providers (such as transportation and logistics providers) could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\n\nIf the quality or safety of products w e sell in stores or online fails to meet our customers' expectations or regulatory standards, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries caused by a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance.\n\nOur customers count on us to provide them with quality products at an affordable price. Occasionally, the quality of products that we source from our suppliers fails to meet customer expectations. In many cases, these products are subject to regulatory action or recall. For general merchandise, this could be because the product fails to meet safety standards. For food products, it could be because the product is a source of foodborne illness. For health and wellness products, it could be because the product does not produce the expected result for the customer or harms the customer. Any of these factors could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to choose to buy products from a different retailer, even if the quality issue is outside of our control.

      "answer": "Costco competes with Kroger by emphasizing price competitiveness, merchandise quality, and a warehouse club model that offers bulk goods and membership benefits. Walmart highlights its Everyday Low Price (EDLP) strategy, omni-channel convenience, and broad product selection as key differentiators against Kroger, while also expanding into digital advertising and fulfillment services. PepsiCo, although not a retailer, competes in the beverage aisle against Kroger's private-label and branded offerings by focusing on brand loyalty, innovation, and digital marketing capabilities. Together, these perspectives reveal that while Costco and Walmart directly compete with Kroger on retail experience and pricing, PepsiCo's positioning reflects a brand-level competition within the same retail ecosystem.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other Information\n\nCompetition. We compete with brick and mortar, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocery, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, and supercenter-type stores, membership-only warehouse clubs, gasoline stations, social commerce platforms, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness and financial services. Our ability to develop and effectively operate different formats at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position in the retail industry within the markets where we operate. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers and greater brand recognition. They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.\n\nWe compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise and selection availability, services offered to customers, the quality of the products and services we offer, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. We employ many strategies and programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These strategies include the following:\n\n- EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;\n- EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers;\n- Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery, all of which enhance convenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served; and\n- Expanding our ecosystem and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial services to provide our customers a broader set of offerings to meet expanding needs.\n\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations. Our business is seasonal to a certain extent and varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, our highest sales volume for each segment has occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.\n\nSuppliers and Supply Chain. As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S. and international suppliers from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the \"fresh\" category. Consistent with applicable laws, we offer our suppliers the opportunity to efficiently sell significant quantities of their products to us. These relationships enable us to obtain pricing that reflects the volume, certainty and cost-effectiveness these arrangements provide to such suppliers, which in turn enables us to provide low prices to our customers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customers, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs, determines, along with other supply chain logistics matters (such as containers or port access for example), in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members.\n\nIntellectual Property. We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent laws, tradesecret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.\n\nGovernment Regulation. As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions.

      "question": "How do Colgate-Palmolive (CL), PepsiCo (PEP), and Philip Morris International (PM) each engage with Turkey across their respective operations, and what does this reveal about the strategic importance of Turkey in the consumer staples sector?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive operates manufacturing and warehousing facilities in Turkey as part of its global Oral, Personal, and Home Care product segment, highlighting Turkey as a key location in its international footprint. PepsiCo notes Turkey as one of the international markets where it faces volatile economic and political conditions that can create challenging operating environments, indicating exposure to macroeconomic risks in the region. Philip Morris International reports a significant market share in Turkey, with cigarette shipments increasing from 47.5 billion units in 2020 to 55.7 billion units in 2021, and a corresponding rise in market share from 41.3% to 44.8%, underscoring Turkey as a growing and strategically important market for its tobacco products. Together, these perspectives show that Turkey is a strategically relevant market in the consumer staples sector, though with varying operational and risk profiles across the companies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nInflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' for further discussion.\n\n## Commodity Prices\n\nOur  commodity  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $1.6  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $1.1 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  At  the  end  of  2021,  the  potential  change  in  fair  value  of  commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $177 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nOur operations outside of the United States generated 44% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa, collectively, comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks  in  the  international  markets  in  which  our  products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2021,  favorable  foreign  exchange  contributed  1  percentage  point  to  net  revenue  growth,  primarily  due  to appreciation  in  the  Mexican  peso,  Canadian  dollar  and  South African  rand.  Currency  declines  against  the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.\n\nIn addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold,  including  in Argentina,  Brazil,  China,  Mexico,  the Middle  East,  Russia  and  Turkey,  and  currency  controls  or  fluctuations  in  certain  of  these  international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments.\n\nOur foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $1.9 billion  as  of  December 26, 2020. At the end of 2021, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $278 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.\n\nThe total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nOur interest  rate  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $2.1  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $3.0 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  Assuming  year-end  2021  investment  levels  and  variable  rate  debt,  a  1percentage-point  increase  in  interest  rates  would  have  decreased  our  net  interest  expense  in  2021  by  $47 million  due  to  higher  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  levels,  as  compared  with  our variable rate debt.\n\n## OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\n## Results of Operations - Consolidated Review\n\n## Volume\n\nPhysical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions,  including  the  preparation  of  our  annual  operating  plan  and  the  evaluation  of  our  business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level.",

PEP explicitly organizes its business into reportable segments that include PBNA (beverage operations in North America) and regional beverage and food divisions across Latin America, Europe, AMESA, and APAC, showing a globally integrated beverage strategy. TGT includes beverages as part of its broader dry grocery and food offerings, sold in its retail stores, suggesting a retail-centric, consumer-facing approach to beverages as a component of general grocery sales.",

(e)\n\nMerchandise sales - We record almost all retail store revenues at the point of sale. Digitally originated sales may include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the guest or upon guest pickup at the store. Total revenues do not include sales tax because  we  are  a  pass-through  conduit  for  collecting  and  remitting  sales  taxes.  Generally,  guests  may  return  national  brand merchandise within 90 days of purchase and owned and exclusive brands within one year of purchase. Sales are recognized net of expected returns, which we estimate using historical return patterns and our expectation of future returns. As of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, the liability for estimated returns was $165 million and $139 million, respectively.\n\nWe routinely enter into arrangements with vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest. Under the vast majority of these arrangements, which represent less than 5 percent of consolidated sales, we record revenue and related costs gross. We concluded that we are the principal in these transactions for a number of reasons, most notably because we 1) control the overall economics of the transactions, including setting the sales price and realizing the majority of cash flows from the sale, 2) control the relationship with the customer, and 3) are responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide goods to the customer. Merchandise received under these arrangements is not included in Inventory because the purchase and sale of this inventory are virtually simultaneous.\n\nRevenue from Target gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption, which is typically within one year of issuance. Our gift cards  do  not  expire.  Based  on  historical  redemption  rates,  a  small  and  relatively  stable  percentage  of  gift  cards  will  never  be redeemed,  referred  to  as  \"breakage.\"  Estimated  breakage  revenue  is  recognized  over  time  in  proportion  to  actual  gift  card redemptions.\n\n2021 Form 10-K",

However, the companies approached the disclosure and timing of adoption differently. Colgate-Palmolive noted that the ASU simplified income tax accounting by removing exceptions and improving consistent application, and it became effective for them on January 1, 2021. Mondelez adopted the ASU on January 1, 2021, as well, and similarly stated it had no material impact. Altria also adopted ASU 2019-12 on the same date and echoed the same conclusion regarding materiality. Despite the uniform outcome, the variations in disclosure depth suggest differing levels of internal evaluation or emphasis on tax policy changes.",

This ASU requires increased disclosure on an annual basis about transactions with domestic, foreign, local, regional and national governments, including entities related to those governments and intergovernmental organizations, that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy to other accounting guidance. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2022 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, 'Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.' This ASU requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASU No. 2016-10, 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).' This guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2023 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope.' This ASU clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. This guidance was effective upon issuance for the Company and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-10, 'Codification Improvements.' This ASU improves the consistency of the codification topics by including all disclosure guidance in the appropriate disclosure section and also clarifies the application of various provisions in the codification. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2021 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.' The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles ('GAAP') to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. This guidance was effective upon issuance of this ASU for contract modifications and hedging relationships on a prospective basis and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-01, 'Investments-Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)-Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815.' The guidance provides clarification of the interaction of rules for equity securities, the equity method of accounting and forward contracts and purchase options on certain types of securities. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2021 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, 'Income taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.' This ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application.

Prior to adopting this ASU, acquired contract assets and liabilities were measured at fair value.

The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions to existing accounting requirements for contract modifications and hedge accounting related to transitioning from discontinued reference rates, such as LIBOR, to alternative reference rates, if certain criteria are met. The new accounting requirements can be applied as of the beginning of the interim period including March 12, 2020, or any date thereafter, through December 31, 2022.

Acquisitions and Divestitures\n\nOn January 3, 2022, we acquired 100% of equity of Chipita S.A. ('Chipita'), a leading croissants and baked snacks company in the Central and Eastern European markets. The acquisition of Chipita offers a strategic complement to our existing portfolio and advances our strategy to become the global leader in broader snacking. The cash consideration for Chipita totaled \u20ac1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) plus the assumption of Chipita's debt of \u20ac0.4 billion ($0.4 billion) totaling the purchase price of \u20ac1.7 billion ($1.9 billion). In 2021, we incurred acquisition-related costs of $6 million and integration costs of $17 million in preparation for the acquisition.\n\nOn November 1, 2021, we completed the sale of MaxFoods Pty Ltd, an Australian packaged seafood business that we had acquired as part of our acquisition of Gourmet Food Holdings Pty Ltd ('Gourmet Food'). The sales price was $57 million Australian dollars ($41 million), net of cash divested with the business, and we recorded an immaterial loss on the transaction. The packaged seafood business added incremental net revenues of $35 million in 2021 and operating income of $5 million during 2021.\n\nOn April 1, 2021, we acquired Gourmet Food, a leading Australian food company in the premium biscuit and cracker category, for closing cash consideration of approximately $450 million Australian dollars ($343 million), net of cash received. We are working to complete the valuation and have recorded a preliminary purchase price allocation of $41 million to indefinite-lived intangible assets, $80 million to definite-lived intangible assets, $164 million to goodwill, $19 million to property, plant and equipment, $18 million to inventory, $25 million to accounts receivable, $12 million to other assets, $5 million to operating right of use assets, $3 million to other current assets, $19 million to current liabilities and $5 million to long-term operating lease liabilities. The acquisition added incremental net revenues of $49 million and operating income of $7 million during 2021. We incurred acquisition-related costs of $7 million in 2021.\n\nOn March 25, 2021, we acquired a majority interest in Lion/Gemstone Topco Ltd ('Grenade'), a performance nutrition leader in the United Kingdom, for closing cash consideration of \u00a3188 million ($261 million), net of cash received. The acquisition of Grenade expands our position into the premium nutrition market. We are working to complete the valuation and have recorded a preliminary purchase price allocation of $82 million to indefinite-lived intangible assets, $28 million to definite-lived intangible assets, $181 million to goodwill, $1 million to property, plant and equipment, $11 million to inventory, $18 million to accounts receivable, $25 million to current liabilities, $20 million to deferred tax liabilities and $15 million to long-term other liabilities. The acquisition added incremental net revenues of $67 million and operating income of $6 million during 2021. We incurred acquisition-related costs of $2 million in 2021.",

Background and Basis of Presentation\n\nWhen used in these notes, the term 'Altria' refers to Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.\n\n- Background: At December 31, 2021, Altria's wholly owned subsidiaries included Philip Morris USA Inc. ('PM USA'), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the United States; John Middleton Co. ('Middleton'), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco and is a wholly owned subsidiary of PM USA; UST LLC ('UST'), which through its wholly owned subsidiary U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC ('USSTC'), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of moist smokeless tobacco products ('MST') and snus products; Helix Innovations LLC ('Helix'), which operates in the United States and Canada, and Helix Innovations GmbH and its subsidiaries ('Helix ROW'), which operate internationally in the rest-of-world, are engaged in the manufacture and sale of on! oral nicotine pouches; and Philip Morris Capital Corporation ('PMCC'), which maintains a portfolio of finance assets, substantially all of which are leveraged leases. Other Altria wholly owned subsidiaries included Altria Group Distribution Company, which provides sales and distribution services to certain Altria operating subsidiaries, and Altria Client Services LLC, which provides various support services in areas such as legal, regulatory, consumer engagement, finance, human resources and external affairs to Altria. Altria's access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2021, Altria's significant wholly owned subsidiaries were not limited by contractual obligations in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.\n\nIn October 2021, UST sold its subsidiary, International Wine &amp; Spirits Ltd. ('IWS'), which included Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd. ('Ste. Michelle'), to an entity controlled by investment funds managed by Sycamore Partners Management, L.P. in an all-cash transaction with a net purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion and the assumption of certain liabilities of IWS and its subsidiaries (the 'Ste. Michelle Transaction').\n\nIn 2019, Helix acquired Burger S\u00f6hne Holding and its subsidiaries as well as certain affiliated companies that are engaged in the manufacture and sale of on! oral nicotine pouches. At closing, Altria owned an 80% interest in Helix, for which Altria paid $353 million. At December 31, 2021, Altria owned 100% of the global on! business as a result of transactions in December 2020 and April 2021 to purchase the remaining 20% interest in (i) Helix ROW and (ii) Helix, respectively. The total purchase price of the December 2020 and April 2021 transactions was approximately $250 million.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Altria's investments in equity securities consisted of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV ('ABI'), Cronos Group Inc. ('Cronos') and JUUL Labs, Inc. ('JUUL'). Altria accounts for its investments in ABI and Cronos under the equity method of accounting using a one-quarter lag. Altria accounts for its equity investment in JUUL under the fair value option.\n\nFor further discussion of Altria's investments in equity securities, see Note 6. Investments in Equity Securities .\n\n- Basis of Presentation: The consolidated financial statements include Altria, as well as its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in equity securities in which Altria has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or the fair value option. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('GAAP') requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions include, among other things, pension and benefit plan assumptions, lives and valuation assumptions for goodwill and other intangible assets, impairment and fair value evaluations for equity investments, marketing programs and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nCertain immaterial prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation.\n\nOn January 1, 2021, Altria adopted Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes ('ASU No. 2019-12'). This guidance removes certain exceptions for investments, intraperiod allocations and interim calculations, and adds guidance to reduce complexity in accounting for income taxes. The adoption of ASU No. 2019-12 did not have a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements.\n\nAdditionally, on January 1, 2021, Altria adopted ASU No. 2020-01, Investments - Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815 ('ASU No. 2020-01'). This guidance provides clarification of the interaction of rules for equity securities, the equity method of accounting, and forward contracts and purchase options on certain types of securities. The adoption of ASU No. 2020-01 did not have a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements.",

      "question": "How do PepsiCo (PEP), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Walmart (WMT) each approach compliance programs in light of their global regulatory exposure, and what does this reveal about their respective risk mitigation strategies?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo emphasizes its adherence to a wide range of global laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the EU\u2019s GDPR, and relies on legal and operational compliance programs to guide its businesses. Procter & Gamble highlights its global compliance programs and internal/external experts to manage regulatory expectations across jurisdictions, noting that compliance costs are not expected to materially affect fiscal year 2025. Walmart underscores the importance of compliance programs in mitigating cybersecurity and data privacy risks, particularly in light of threats like ransomware and AI-enabled identity fraud, which could lead to regulatory fines and reputational damage. Together, these approaches show that while all three companies rely on compliance programs, their focus areas differ: PEP on regulatory diversity, PG on cost and continuity, and WMT on digital risk and data security.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PEP \u2192 Compliance Programs: PEP explicitly mentions reliance on legal and operational compliance programs to guide its businesses in adhering to global laws, including anti-corruption and data privacy regulations like the GDPR and FCPA.",

        "Hop 3: WMT \u2192 Compliance Programs: WMT discusses compliance programs in the context of cybersecurity and data protection, noting that breaches could lead to regulatory fines and reputational damage, and that compliance efforts are critical to managing systemic risks."

          "chunk_text": "Government Regulation . Our Company is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business. In the United States, many of our products and manufacturing operations are subject to one or more federal or state regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and antitrust and competition laws and regulations that govern our dealings with suppliers, customers, competitors and government officials.\n\nIn addition, many foreign jurisdictions in which we do business have regulations and regulatory bodies that govern similar aspects of our operations and products, in some cases to an even more significant degree. We are also subject to expanding laws and regulations related to environmental protection and other sustainabilityrelated matters, non-financial reporting and diligence, labor and employment, trade, taxation and privacy and data protection, including the European Union's G eneral Data Protection Regulation and similar regulations in states within the United States and in countries around the world.\n\nThe Company has in place compliance programs and internal and external experts to help guide our business in complying with these and other existing laws and regulations  that  apply  to  us  around  the  globe;  and  we  have  made,  and  plan  to  continue  making,  necessary  ex penditures  for  compliance  with  these  laws  and regulations. We also expect that our many suppliers, consultants and other third parties working on our behalf share our commitment to compliance, and we have policies and procedures in place to manage these relationships, though they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over operations and governance. We do not expect that the Company's expenditures for compliance with current government regulations, including current environmental regulations, will have a material effect on our total capital ex penditures, earnings or competitive position in fiscal year 2025 as compared to prior periods.\n\nHuman Capital .  Our employees are a key source of competitive advantage. Their actions, guided by our Purpose, V alues and Principles (PVPs), are critical to the long-term success of our business. We aim to retain our talented employees by offering competitive compensation and benefits, strong career development and a respectful and inclusive culture that provides equal opportunity for all.\n\nOur Board of Directors, through the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee (C&amp;LD Committee), provides oversight of the Company's policies and strategy relating to talent, including equality and inclusion, as well as the Company's compensation principles and practices. The C&amp;LD Committee also evaluates and approves the Company's compensation plans, policies and programs applicable to our senior executives.\n\n## Employees\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 108,000 employees, unchanged versus the prior year. The total number of employees is an estimate of total Company employees excluding interns, co-ops, contractors and employees of joint ventures. 48% of our employees are in manufacturing roles and 28% of our employees are located in the United States. 42% of our global employees are women and 32% of our U.S. employees identify as multicultural.\n\n## Training and Development\n\nWe focus on attracting, developing and retaining the widest pool of talent available, both from universities and the broader market. We recruit from universities across markets in which we compete and are generally able to select from the top talent. We focus on developing our employees by providing a variety of job experiences, training programs and skill development opportunities. G iven our develop-from-within model for staffing most of our senior leadership positions, it is particularly important for us to ensure holistic growth and full engagement of our employees.\n\n## Diversity, Equality and Inclusion\n\nAs a consumer products company, we believe that it is important for our workforce to reflect the diversity of our consumers worldwide. We also seek to foster an inclusive work environment where each individual can bring their authentic self, which helps drive innovation and enables us to better serve our consumers. We aspire to achieve equal gender representation globally and at key management and leadership levels. Within the U.S. workforce, our aspiration is to achieve 40% multicultural representation overall as well as at management and leadership levels.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nMarket-competitive compensation and reward programs are critical elements of our employee value equation to attract and retain the best talent. Our total rewards programs are based on the principles of paying for performance, paying competitively versus peer companies that we compete with for talent in the marketplace and focusing  on  long-term  success  through  a  combination  of  short-term  and  long-term  incentive  programs.  We  also  offer  competitive  benefit  programs,  including retirement plans and health insurance, in line with local country practices, with flex ibility to accommodate the needs of a diverse workforce.\n\nSustainability . Environmental sustainability is integrated into our business strategy. We are focused on designing and manufacturing irresistibly superior products that are more sustainable. We aim to reduce our own environmental footprint and enable our consumers to reduce their footprint without compromising on the performance of the products they use. We develop and license technologies that can be used across industries to improve environmental sustainability at a broader scale.",

Such attacks, if successful, may result in potential data and personal information misuse and/or loss and may create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage the information systems that enable or support one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience, our supply chain integrity and continuity and our ability to efficiently operate our business. If we are unable to maintain the security of the information systems that enable or support our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could be subject to regulatory fines, suffer loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers, members or others whose personal or confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.\n\nAssociate error or malfeasance, faulty password and identity management, social engineering or other vulnerabilities and irregularities may also result in a defeat of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and a compromise or breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, the hardware, software or applications that comprise our information system and networked environment may have vulnerabilities or defects of design, coding, manufacture or operations that could be intentionally ex ploited or inadvertently used in a manner that could compromise information security. Given the age, size and complexity of these information systems and our networked environment, patches for certain vulnerabilities may not exist and, even where patches or other risk-mitigating activities are available, the deployment of patches or execution of risk-mitigating actions may not occur before an underlying vulnerability is exploited by threat actors or inadvertently results in the compromise of our information systems or data.\n\nAny compromise of our information systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in regulated data or confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, disclosed, destroyed, modified, lost or used by unauthorized persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions (including, with respect to health information, liability under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, collectively known as \"HIPAA\" and with respect to personal information, liability under international and state data breach notification laws), customer attrition, remediation ex penses and claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, reputation, financial position and results of operations.\n\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems or data change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures, or detect the activities of a threat actor. Moreover, the increasing sophistication of AI technologies poses a greater risk of identity fraud, as malicious actors may exploit AI to create convincing false identities or manipulate verification processes. Even if we detect a fraudulent or cybersecurity incident, the nature and ex tent of that incident may not be immediately clear. Based on the sophistication of the threat actors and the size and complexity of our information systems and networked environment, among other factors, an investigation into a cybersecurity incident could take a significant amount of time to complete. We may not understand or appreciate that what is detected and treated as multiple individual cybersecurity incidents or events may be associated with the coordinated actions of a single threat actor or group. In addition, while our investigation of a cybersecurity incident is ongoing, we may not know the full extent of the harm caused by a threat actor, and such harm may spread both internally and to certain customers, vendors or other third parties. These factors may inhibit our ability to provide rapid, complete and reliable information about the cybersecurity incident to customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. It may also not be clear how best to contain and remediate any harm caused by the cybersecurity incident, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cybersecurity incident on our business operations, financial position and results of operations.\n\nTo the extent that any cyberattack, ransomware or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or other compromise of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, members, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others.\n\nOur compliance programs, information technology and enterprise risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk. Disruptions in our systems caused by associate error or malfeasance, security incidents, breaches or cyberattacks - including attacks on those parties we do business with (such as strategic partners, suppliers, banks or utility companies) - could harm our ability to conduct our operations, which may have a material effect on us, may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, or may have a cascading effect that adversely impacts our partners, third-party service providers, customers, members, financial services firms and other third parties that we interact with on a regular basis.\n\nOur reputation with our customers and members is important to the success of our enterprise strategy, which combines traditional retail, membership models, marketplaces, financial services, health and wellness and other customer and business",

Target specifically mentions that social unrest in its international administrative and sourcing locations, such as India and Asia, could disrupt operations and adversely affect its financial condition.

RISK FACTORS\n\nIn addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report, set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities. These risks, some of which have occurred and/or are occurring and any of which could occur in the future, are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.\n\n## Business and Industry Risks\n\nWe face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nWe operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately two-thirds of our Net sales originating in markets outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we face risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:\n\n- changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of inflationary pressure, economic slowdown or recession, the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, major developments in trade relations, volatile commodity prices and increases and/or volatility in the cost of raw and packaging materials, labor, energy and logistics;\n- changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows from non-U.S. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars, in those markets;\n- political instability or uncertainty, including as a result of elections, economic instability, geopolitical events and tensions, wars and military conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East and tensions between China and Taiwan;\n- changes to trade policies and agreements and other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of and/or the increase in trade restrictions and/or tariffs, sanctions, price controls, labor laws, travel or immigration restrictions, profit controls or other government controls, including as a result of the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East and tensions between China and Taiwan;\n- environmental events, widespread health emergencies, such as pandemics or epidemics, natural disasters or social or labor unrest;\n- exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import or ex port raw materials or finished product, including as a result of the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, or to repatriate earnings from overseas;\n- lack of well-established, reliable and/or impartial legal systems in certain countries where we operate and difficulties in enforcing contractual, intellectual property or other legal rights; and\n- foreign ownership and investment restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources.\n\nAny or all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix  from higher margin to lower margin product offerings.\n\nWe face risks resulting from political and macroeconomic instability and geopolitical events and tensions, such as the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East and tensions between China and Taiwan.

          "chunk_text": "Combined, this approach intends to positively impact the total environmental impact of the Company while driving market growth and value creation.\n\nIn 2021, the Company announced a 2040 net zero ambition. Our Climate Transition Action Plan outlines the Company's ongoing efforts toward reducing greenhouse gas  emissions  across  scopes  1  and  2  and  elements  of  scope  3.  The  Company  has  also  declared  objectives  towards  purchasing  renewable  electricity  for  our operations, reducing use of virgin petroleum-based plastic in packaging, increasing the recyclability or reusability of packaging, responsible sourcing of key forestbased commodities, improving efficiency of water usage in our operations and driving a global portfolio of water restoration projects that help address water scarcity in key water basins. Our progress towards these objectives may be influenced and impacted by various stakeholders and developments beyond our control.\n\nSustainability related disclosures included in this Annual Report, our Proxy Statement and our sustainability reports are informed by standards and guidelines such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The 'materiality' thresholds in those standards and guidelines may differ from the concept of 'materiality' for purposes of the federal securities laws and disclosures required by the Commission's rules in this Annual Report. References to our sustainability reports and website are for informational purposes only and neither the sustainability reports nor the other information on our website is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional detailed information on our sustainability efforts can be found on our website at https://pginvestor.com/esg.\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nWe discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-K, as well as in our quarterly and annual reports, current reports on Form 8-K, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are 'forward-looking statements' and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors, ex cept to the ex tent required by law . Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations.\n\nThe following discussion of 'risk factors' identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes incorporated in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends, perhaps materially.\n\n## MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND RELATED FINANCIAL RISKS\n\n## Our  business  is  subject  to  numerous  risks  as  a  result  of  hav ing  significant  operations  and  sales  in  international  markets,  including  foreign  currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls.\n\nWe are a global company, with operations in about 70 countries and products sold in about 180 countries and territories around the world. We hold assets, incur liabilities, generate sales and pay ex penses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our operations outside the U.S. generate more than 50% of our annual net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have and could continue to reduce the U.S. dollar value of sales, earnings and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in U.S. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition.\n\nFurther,  we  have  a  significant  amount  of  foreign  currency  debt  and  derivatives  as  part  of  our  capital  markets  activities.  The  maturity  cash  outflows  of  these instruments could be adversely impacted by significant appreciation of foreign currency exchange rates (particularly the Euro), which could adversely impact our overall cash flows. Moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries, including changes to tariffs and ex isting trade policies and agreements, could adversely affect our results. See also the Results of Operations and Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity sections of the MD&amp;A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.\n\nWe also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls or restrictions. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business.\n\n## Uncertain economic or social conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic or social disruptions. These disruptions have included and may in the future include: a slow-down, recession or inflationary pressures in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers; a significant shift in government policies; significant social unrest; the deterioration of economic relations between countries or regions; potential negative consumer sentiment toward non-local products or sources;",

If we do not effectively manage our workforce, our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWith over 400,000 team members, our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense, and our business is dependent on our ability to attract, train, and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team members, contractors, and temporary staffing. Many team members are in entry-lev el or part-time positions with high turnov er rates historically. Our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as labor  laws  and  regulations,  labor  av ailability,  unemployment  lev els,  prev ailing  wage  rates,  benefit  costs,  changing  demographics,  immigration  laws  and regulations (including through executiv e orders), and our reputation within the labor market. If we are unable to attract and retain a workforce meeting our needs (including for specialized roles with significant competition for talent) or are unable to successfully execute on succession planning at all lev els of the organization, our operations, strategy, guest serv ice lev els, support functions, and competitiv eness could suffer. Any of these outcomes could adv ersely affect  our  reputation,  results  of  operations,  and  financial  condition.  We  are  periodically  subject  to  labor  organizing  efforts  and  activ ism,  which  could negativ ely impact how we are perceiv ed by team members and our ov erall reputation. If we become subject to one or more collectiv e bargaining agreements in the future, it could adv ersely affect our labor costs, how we operate our business, and our results of operations. In addition to our U.S. operations, we perform additional administrativ e functions in Bangalore, India, and perform global sourcing operations from offices in 12 countries, predominantly in Asia and Central America, and any extended disruption of our operations in our different locations, whether due to labor difficulties or otherwise, could adv ersely affect our results of operations. In particular, we rely on our administrativ e functions in India for v arious business operations and any ev ents that negativ ely impact  the  av ailability  or  effectiv eness  of  our  administrativ e  functions  in  India,  including  political  or  economic  uncertainty  or  instability,  the  outbreak  of pandemics or other illnesses, labor shortages, labor unrest or strikes, weather conditions, natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, social unrest, terrorist attacks, and armed conflicts, could adv ersely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Failure to address product safety and sourcing concerns could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nIf  any  of  our  merchandise  offerings  do  not  meet  applicable  safety  standards  or  T arget's  or  our  guests'  expectations  regarding  safety,  supply  chain transparency, and responsible sourcing, we could be exposed to legal and reputational risks and our results of operations could be adv ersely affected. Our vendors  must  comply  with  applicable  product  safety  laws,  and  we  are  dependent  on  them  to  ensure  that  the  products  we  buy  comply  with  all  safety standards. Ev ents that giv e rise to actual or perceiv ed product safety concerns, including food or drug contamination and product defects, could expose us to gov ernment enforcement actions and priv ate litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. Our sourcing v endors, including any third parties selling through our digital channels, must also meet our expectations and comply with applicable laws and regulations across multiple areas of social  compliance,  including  supply  chain  transparency  and  responsible  sourcing.  We  hav e  a  social  compliance  audit  process  that  performs  audits regularly, but we cannot continuously monitor ev ery v endor, so we are also dependent on our v endors to ensure that the products we buy comply with applicable standards. If we need to seek alternativ e sources of supply from v endors with whom we hav e less familiarity, the risk of these standards not being met may increase. Negativ e guest perceptions regarding the safety and sourcing of the products we sell could harm our reputation and adv ersely affect our results of operations.",

PepsiCo (PEP) shows a $57 million loss in 2024 from commodity contracts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, indicating a more forward-looking hedging strategy with deferred income statement impact.

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) subjects its goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as global brands, to annual impairment tests or when events suggest potential impairment. Coca-Cola (KO) performs impairment tests on equity method investments and indefinite-lived intangible assets, particularly in various global regions, due to uncertainties in economic, political, and regulatory environments. PepsiCo (PEP) conducts impairment tests on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment, and also evaluates amortizable intangible assets and equity method investments for impairment upon significant changes in the operating or macroeconomic environment. All three companies highlight the sensitivity of these tests to assumptions like growth rates, discount rates, and geopolitical conditions, but differ in the scope and emphasis of their disclosures.",

PepsiCo similarly reports that sales to Walmart and its affiliates accounted for about 13% of its consolidated net revenue in 2021, emphasizing the significance of Walmart in its revenue base. Walmart, in turn, describes itself as a global retail leader with a strategy focused on price leadership and omni-channel convenience, serving approximately 230 million customers weekly across more than 10,500 stores and numerous eCommerce platforms.

Segment Information\n\nThe Company operates in two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition.\n\nThe operations of the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment are managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia.\n\nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of Corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intercompany sales have been eliminated. Corporate operations include costs related to stock options and restricted stock units, research and development costs, Corporate overhead costs, restructuring and related implementation charges and gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets. The Company reports these items within Corporate operations as they relate to Corporate-based responsibilities and decisions and are not included in the internal measures of segment operating performance used by the Company to measure the underlying performance of the operating segments.\n\nApproximately 70% of the Company's Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45% of the Company's Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). Oral, Personal and Home Care sales to Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 12%, 12% and 11% of the Company's Net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No other customer represented more than 10% of Net sales in any period presented.\n\nIn 2021, Corporate Operating profit included goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges of $571, and a benefit of $26 related to a value-added tax matter in Brazil. In 2020, Corporate Operating profit included benefits of $16 resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and a charge of $6 for acquisition-related costs. In 2019, Corporate Operating profit included charges of $125 resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, a charge of $24 for acquisition-related costs and a benefit of $30 from a value-added tax matter in Brazil.\n\n98\n\n",

These assets are reported in the country where they are primarily used.\n\n- (b) The increase in net revenue reflects our acquisition of Be &amp; Cheery. See Note 13 for further information.\n- (c) The increase in net revenue reflects our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. See Note 13 for further information.\n\n## Note 2 - Our Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Merchandising  activities  are  immaterial  in  the  context  of  our  contracts.  In  addition,  we  exclude  from  net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue producing transactions.\n\nThe transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for  a  right  of  return.  However,  our  policy  for  DSD,  including  certain  chilled  products,  is  to  remove  and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality  and  freshness  they  expect.  Similarly,  our  policy  for  certain  warehouse-distributed  products  is  to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.\n\nOur products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.\n\nWe estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and  collectibility,  write-off  history,  the  aging  of  accounts  receivable,  our  analysis  of  customer  data,  and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.\n\nWe are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers. In 2021, sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam's) represented  approximately  13%  of  our  consolidated  net  revenue,  including  concentrate  sales  to  our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart.\n\n## Total Marketplace Spending\n\nWe  offer  sales  incentives  and  discounts  through  various  programs  to  customers  and  consumers.  Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives  and  discounts  are  primarily  accounted  for  as  a  reduction  of  revenue  and  include  payments  to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution  of  new  products,  payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives  and  discounts  also  include  support  provided  to  our  independent  bottlers  through  funding  of advertising and other marketing activities.\n\nA  number  of  our  sales  incentives,  such  as  bottler  funding  to  independent  bottlers  and  customer  volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for  the  expected  payout,  which  may  occur  after  year  end  once  reconciled  and  settled.  These  accruals  are based  on  contract  terms  and  our  historical  experience  with  similar  programs  and  require  management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance",

(\"Walmart,\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") helps people around the world save money and live better - anytime and anywhere - by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through eCommerce, and to access our other service offerings. Through innovation, we strive to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers. Each week, we serve approximately 230 million customers who visit more than 10,500 stores and numerous eCommerce websites under 46 banners in 24 countries.\n\nOur strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become more digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. Making life easier for busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time. By leading on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (\"EDLP\"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Everyday low cost (\"EDLC\") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers.\n\nOur operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a onemonth lag and on a calendar year basis. Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 (\"fiscal 2022\"), January 31, 2021 (\"fiscal 2021\") and January 31, 2020 (\"fiscal 2020\"). During fiscal 2022, we generated total revenues of $572.8 billion, which was comprised primarily of net sales of $567.8 billion.\n\nWe maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"WMT.\"\n\n## The Development of Our Company\n\nThe businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31, 2022, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 23 countries.\n\nIn 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. To date, we now have over 8,000 pickup and 6,000 delivery locations globally. In recent years, we have heavily invested in omni-channel and eCommerce innovation, as well as made several eCommerce acquisitions to better serve our customers. These investments have enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, incubate digitally-native brands, and expand our assortment and service offerings. We have also continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives internationally, such as with our acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\"), which is our ecosystem in India that includes eCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra as well as PhonePe, a digital transaction platform.\n\nWe are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, service offerings, eCommerce websites and marketplaces as well as our supply chain combined with approximately 2.3 million associates as of January 31, 2022 to better serve our customers. Together, we believe these elements produce a flywheel effect which creates relationships where customers view Walmart as their primary destination. In the U.S., our Walmart+ membership incorporates several service offerings which provide enhanced omni-channel shopping experiences and benefits for members. As we execute on our strategy, our flywheel is accelerating through offerings such as our Walmart Connect advertising business, Walmart Fulfillment Services, our health and wellness business, including Walmart Health, and our financial services business. These offerings represent mutually reinforcing pieces of our flywheel centered around our customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience.",

Altria uses LIFO for the majority of its inventories, particularly tobacco inventories, with approximately 81% and 59% of its inventories valued under LIFO at the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively, and notes that LIFO values were approximately $0.6 billion lower than current cost in both years. Walmart applies the LIFO method to its Walmart U.S. segment inventories using the retail inventory method and Sam's Club inventories using a weighted-average cost LIFO method, and notes that as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, LIFO inventories approximated FIFO values. The comparative use of LIFO shows that while all three companies apply LIFO, the extent and impact vary significantly: Altria relies heavily on LIFO with a large valuation difference from current cost, Colgate-Palmolive uses it selectively, and Walmart's LIFO inventory values closely align with FIFO due to stable price indices.",

Advertising costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred. Certain consumer and trade promotional programs, such as consumer coupons, are recorded as a reduction of sales.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe cost of approximately 75% of inventories is determined using the FIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of all other inventories, in the U.S. and Mexico, is determined using the LIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories in excess of one year of forecasted sales are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent 'Other assets.'\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nLand, buildings and machinery and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided, primarily using the straight-line method, over-estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings. Depreciation attributable to manufacturing operations is included in Cost of sales. The remaining component of depreciation is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangibles\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the Company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Other intangible assets with finite lives, such as local brands and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 40 years. Amortization expense related to intangible assets is included in Other (income) expense, net, which is included in Operating profit.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect at the time such differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive model to recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on an income tax return. The Company recognizes interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within Provision for income taxes.",

The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost in future years.\n\n- Environmental Costs: Altria is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Altria provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change.\n\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation and compliance costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows. See Note 18. Contingencies -Environmental Regulation .\n\n- Fair Value Measurements: Altria measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Altria uses a fair value hierarchy, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are:\n- Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n- Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n- Guarantees: Altria recognizes a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities. See Note 18 . Contingencies for a further discussion of guarantees.\n- Income Taxes: Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Altria records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Altria determines the realizability of deferred tax assets based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence. In reaching this determination, Altria considers the character of the assets and the possible sources of taxable income of the appropriate character within the available carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law.\n\nAltria recognizes the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Altria recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\n- Inventories: The last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method is used to determine the cost of substantially all tobacco inventories. The cost of the remaining inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') and average cost methods. Inventories that are measured using the LIFO method are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories that are measured using the FIFO and average cost methods are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco and wine inventories as current assets although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the curing and aging process, ordinarily would not be used within one year. The cost of approximately 81% and 59% of inventories at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was determined using the LIFO method. The increase in LIFO percentage was due to the Ste. Michelle Transaction (as Ste. Michelle accounted for its inventory using FIFO). The stated LIFO amounts of inventories were approximately $0.6 billion lower than the current cost of inventories at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n- Investments in Equity Securities: Investments in equity securities in which Altria has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or the fair value option. The election of the fair value option is irrevocable and is made on an investment by investment basis.\n\nAltria elected to account for its investments in ABI and Cronos under the equity method of accounting. Altria's share of equity (income) losses and other adjustments associated with these equity investments are included in (income) losses from equity investments in the consolidated statements of earnings (losses). The carrying value for each of Altria's equity investments in ABI and Cronos is reported in",

Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.\n\n## Other Matters\n\nIn Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned \"Contingencies\" and appears in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \"Item 8.

In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates.\n\nManagement continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.\n\n## Inventories\n\nWe value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\").",

Segment Information\n\nThe Company operates in two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition.\n\nThe operations of the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment are managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia.\n\nIn connection with management changes, the Company realigned the reporting structure of its skin health business effective July 1, 2024. Accordingly, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the results of the skin health business previously reported within the Europe reportable operating segment are reported with the other skin health businesses in the North America reportable operating segment, with no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company has recast its historical geographic segment information to conform to the new reporting structure.\n\nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of Corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes. The Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer has been determined to be the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker who uses Operating Profit to assess performance and to allocate resources for each of the reportable operating segments in the budgeting and forecasting process. Asset information by segment is not utilized for purposes of assessing performance or allocating resources, and therefore such information has not been presented.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intercompany sales have been eliminated. Corporate operations include costs related to stock options and restricted stock units, research and development costs, Corporate overhead costs, restructuring and related implementation charges and gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets. The Company reports these items within Corporate operations as they relate to Corporate-based responsibilities and decisions and are not included in the internal measures of segment operating performance used by the Company to measure the underlying performance of the operating segments.\n\nApproximately two-thirds of the Company's Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45% of the Company's Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). Oral, Personal and Home Care sales to Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 11% of the Company's Net sales in each of the years 2024, 2023 and 2022. No other customer represented more than 10% of Net sales in any period presented.\n\nIn 2024, Corporate Operating profit included charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative of $85. In 2023, Corporate Operating profit included charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative of $27 and product recall costs of $25. In 2022, Corporate Operating profit included goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges of $721, charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative of $95, a gain on the sale of land in Asia Pacific of $47 and acquisition-related costs of $19.",

Organic sales in Latin America increased 8.0% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in Latin America in 2021 versus 2020 was due to increases in Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the bar soap and underarm protection categories.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nArgentina. During the second quarter of 2018, primarily based on published estimates that indicated Argentina's threeyear cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%, we concluded that Argentina became a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes. As of July 1, 2018, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our Argentinean subsidiaries and changed their functional currency from the Argentinean peso to the U.S. dollar. On July 1, 2018, both monetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Argentinean pesos were remeasured into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, with remeasurement and other transaction gains and losses recorded in net earnings. As of December 31, 2021, our Argentinean operations had $9 million of Argentinean peso denominated net monetary assets. Our Argentinean operations contributed $401 million, or 1.4% of consolidated net revenues in 2021. We recorded a remeasurement loss of $13 million in 2021, a remeasurement loss of $9 million in 2020 and a remeasurement gain of $4 million in 2019 within selling, general and administrative expenses related to the revaluation of the Argentinean peso denominated net monetary position over these periods.\n\nBrexit . Following the separation of the United Kingdom from the European Union ('Brexit') in 2020, a new trade arrangement was reached between the U.K. and E.U. that began on January 1, 2021. The main trade provisions include the continuation of no tariffs or quotas on trade between the U.K. and E.U. subject to prescribed trade terms, including but not limited to meeting product and labeling standards for both the U.K. and E.U. Cross-border trade between the U.K. and E.U. is also subject to new customs regulations, documentation and reviews. To comply with the new requirements, we increased resources in customer service and logistics, in our factories, and on our customs support teams. We adapted our processes and systems for the new and increased number of customs transactions. We continue to closely monitor and manage our inventory levels of imported raw materials, packaging and finished goods in the U.K. We have made investments in resources, systems and processes to meet the new ongoing requirements and we work to mitigate disruptions to our local supply chain and distribution, including those related to the recent transportation labor shortage in the U.K., to reduce the impact on our input and distribution costs. Despite our efforts to control costs, we have seen inflationary cost pressures rise in our U.K. business this year, as we have also experienced in other markets. If the U.K.'s separation from, or new trade arrangements with, the E.U. negatively impact the U.K. economy or result in disagreements on trade terms, delays affecting our supply chain or distribution, disruptions to sales or collections, or further increases in inflationary cost pressures, the impact to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be material. In 2021, we generated 9.3% of our net revenues in the U.K.\n\nOther Countries . Since we sell our products in over 150 countries and have operations in approximately 80 countries, we monitor economic and currency-related risks and seek to take protective measures in response to these exposures. We continue to monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts to our `business operations, currencies and net monetary exposures. Since the global onset of COVID-19 in early 2020, most countries in which we do business experienced periods of significant economic uncertainty as well as exchange rate volatility. At this time, except for Argentina which is accounted for as a highly inflationary economy, we do not anticipate any other countries in which we operate to be at risk of becoming highly inflationary economies.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash:\n\nCash and cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. We also had restricted cash within other current assets of $7 million as of December 31, 2021 and $31 million as of December 31, 2020. Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $3,553 million as of December 31, 2021 and $3,650 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Allowances for Credit Losses:\n\nThe allowances for credit losses are recorded against our receivables. They are developed at a country and region level based on historical collection experiences, current economic condition of specific customers and the forecasted economic condition of countries using various factors such as bond default rates and consumption indexes. We write off receivables once it is determined that the receivables are no longer collectible and as allowed by local laws.",

See 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' for further discussion.\n\n## Commodity Prices\n\nOur  commodity  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $1.6  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $1.1 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  At  the  end  of  2021,  the  potential  change  in  fair  value  of  commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $177 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nOur operations outside of the United States generated 44% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa, collectively, comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks  in  the  international  markets  in  which  our  products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2021,  favorable  foreign  exchange  contributed  1  percentage  point  to  net  revenue  growth,  primarily  due  to appreciation  in  the  Mexican  peso,  Canadian  dollar  and  South African  rand.  Currency  declines  against  the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.\n\nIn addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold,  including  in Argentina,  Brazil,  China,  Mexico,  the Middle  East,  Russia  and  Turkey,  and  currency  controls  or  fluctuations  in  certain  of  these  international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments.\n\nOur foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $1.9 billion  as  of  December 26, 2020. At the end of 2021, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $278 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.\n\nThe total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nOur interest  rate  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $2.1  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $3.0 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  Assuming  year-end  2021  investment  levels  and  variable  rate  debt,  a  1percentage-point  increase  in  interest  rates  would  have  decreased  our  net  interest  expense  in  2021  by  $47 million  due  to  higher  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  levels,  as  compared  with  our variable rate debt.\n\n## OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\n## Results of Operations - Consolidated Review\n\n## Volume\n\nPhysical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions,  including  the  preparation  of  our  annual  operating  plan  and  the  evaluation  of  our  business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level.",

          "chunk_text": "## Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position\n\nWe believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business. Refer to the heading 'Cash Flows from Operating Activities' below. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners' equity. Refer to the heading 'Cash Flows from Financing Activities' below. We have a history of borrowing funds both domestically and internationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. Our debt financing also includes the use of a commercial paper program. We currently have the ability to borrow funds in this market at levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy and expect to continue to be able to do so in the future.\n\nThe Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and, as a result of this review, during 2021 we issued U.S. dollar- and euro-denominated long-term notes of $6.0 billion and \u20ac3.2 billion, respectively, across various maturities. We used a portion of the proceeds from these issuances to extinguish certain tranches of our previously issued long-term debt. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these issuances and extinguishments.\n\nThe Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. In addition to these funds, our commercial paper program and our ability to issue long-term debt, we had $8.1 billion in unused backup lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of December 31, 2021. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2022 through 2027.\n\nWhile uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, we expect to continue to see improvements in our business as vaccines become more widely available. The timing and availability of vaccines will be different around the world, and therefore we believe the pace of the recovery will vary by geography depending on vaccine availability, rates of vaccination and the effectiveness of vaccines against existing and new variants of the virus, along with other macroeconomic factors. We will remain flexible so that we can adjust to uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our current capital allocation priorities are as follows: investing wisely to support our business operations, continuing to grow our dividend payment, enhancing our beverage portfolio and capabilities through opportunistic and disciplined acquisitions, and using excess cash to repurchase shares over time. We currently expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.5 billion. During 2022, we also expect to repurchase approximately $500 million of shares in addition to repurchasing shares equivalent to the proceeds from the issuances of stock under our stock-based compensation plans.\n\nWe are currently in litigation with the IRS for tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the IRS; however, a final decision is still pending and the timing of such decision is not currently known. The Company strongly disagrees with the IRS' positions and the portions of the Opinion affirming such positions and intends to vigorously defend our positions utilizing every available avenue of appeal. While the Company believes that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments proposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In the event that all of the adjustments proposed by the IRS are ultimately upheld for tax years 2007 through 2009 and the IRS, with the consent of the federal courts, were to decide to apply the Tax Court Methodology to the subsequent years up to and including 2021, the Company currently estimates that the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $13 billion as of December 31, 2021. Additional income tax and interest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. Once the Tax Court renders a final decision, the Company will have 90 days to file a notice of appeal and pay the portion of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which we currently estimate to be approximately $4.9 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2021), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of payment. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation.\n\nWhile we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed above, we are confident that, between our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, we can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter.\n\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Cash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nAs part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to revisit terms and conditions, including the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. Additionally, two global financial institutions offer a voluntary supply chain finance ('SCF') program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to these",

For  further  details,  see  Item  8,  Note  7. Indebtedness to our consolidated financial statements;\n- accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet (primarily short-term in nature);\n- purchase obligations for inventory and production costs to be utilized in the normal course of business such as raw materials, electronic devices, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution, as well as capital expenditures.

Our  ability  to  access  the  capital  and  credit  markets  as  well  as overall  dynamics  of  these  markets  may  impact  borrowing  costs. We  expect  that  the  combination  of  our  long-term  and  short-term  debt financing, the commercial paper program and the committed credit facilities, coupled with our operating cash flows, will enable us to meet our liquidity requirements.\n\n## \u00b7 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, other than guarantees, and cash requirements discussed above.\n\nGuarantees -At December 31, 2021, we have guarantees of our own performance, which are primarily related to excise taxes on the shipment of our products. There is no liability in the consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees. These guarantees have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on PMI's liquidity. In October 2020, we guaranteed an obligation for an equity method investee. For further details, see Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Equity and Dividends\n\nWe discuss our stock awards as of December 31, 2021, in Item 8, Note 9. Stock Plans to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nDuring 2020 and the first six months of 2021, we did not repurchase any shares under a share repurchase program. On June 11, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $7 billion, with target spending of $5 billion to $7 billion over a three-year period. On July 22, 2021, we began repurchasing shares under this new share repurchase program. From July 22, 2021 through December 31, 2021, we repurchased 8.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $785 million.\n\nDividends  paid  in  2021  were  $7.6  billion.  During  the  third  quarter  of  2021,  our  Board  of  Directors  approved  a  4.2%  increase  in  the quarterly dividend to $1.25 per common share. As a result, the present annualized dividend rate is $5.00 per common share.",

          "chunk_text": "\nCredit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.\n\n## Other Matters\n\nIn Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned \"Contingencies\" and appears in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" we discuss, under the sub-caption \" Opioids Litigation ,\" the Prescription Opiate Litigation and other matters, including certain risks arising therefrom. In that Note 10, we also discuss, under the sub-caption \" Asda Equal Value Claims,\" the Company's indemnification obligation for the Asda Equal Value Claims matter. We discuss various legal proceedings related to the Federal and State Prescription Opiate Litigation, DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation and Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings,\" under the sub-caption \"I. Supplemental Information.\" We also discuss items related to the Asda Equal Value Claims matter, the Money Transfer Agent Services Proceedings matter and the Foreign Direct Investment matters in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings,\" under the subcaption \"II. Certain Other Matters.\" We also discuss an environmental matter with the State of California in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings,\" under the sub-caption \"III. Environmental Matters.\" The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or may not result in the incurrence of a material liability by the Company upon their final resolution.\n\n## Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nManagement strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates.\n\nManagement continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.\n\n## Inventories\n\nWe value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\").",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) disclosed that 3,029 thousand Performance Share Units (PSUs) were certified with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $57.00 per unit for the 2020\u20132022 annual award, and 1,099 thousand PSUs were certified with a fair value of $48.36 per unit for the 2021\u20132022 Emerging Stronger Award. Philip Morris (PM) indicated that 2,854,560 shares may be issued upon vesting of performance share units if maximum performance targets are achieved, though it does not specify grant values or performance conditions beyond the dependency on performance cycles. Target (TGT) disclosed that its PSUs are based on performance relative to a retail peer group over a 3- or 4-year period, with weighted-average grant date fair values of $162.54, $216.63, and $179.58 in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The companies differ in the specificity of their disclosures, with TGT providing the most detailed performance metrics and KO offering quantified grant values, while PM provides limited detail on valuation and performance criteria.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: KO \u2192 Performance Share Units: KO provides specific numbers of PSUs certified (3,029k and 1,099k) and their respective weighted-average grant date fair values ($57.00 and $48.36).",
        "Hop 2: PM \u2192 Performance Share Units: PM states that 2,854,560 shares may be issued upon vesting of PSUs if maximum performance targets are met, but does not disclose grant values or specific performance metrics.",
        "Hop 3: TGT \u2192 Performance Share Units: TGT explains that PSUs are based on relative performance against a retail peer group over 3\u20134 years and provides annual grant date fair values ($162.54 in 2023, $216.63 in 2022, $179.58 in 2021)."

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) uses cross-currency interest rate swaps as part of its fair value hedging strategy, with a total notional value of $13,693 million as of December 31, 2023, to hedge foreign currency-denominated debt against fluctuations in exchange rates and benchmark interest rates. Mondelez (MDLZ) discloses that it uses cross-currency interest rate swaps and forwards to hedge investments in non-U.S. operations, with a total notional value of $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2023. Walmart (WMT) uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge currency exposure from forecasted payments on non-U.S. denominated debt, with swaps maturing between July 2024 and January 2039.

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola (KO), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Philip Morris (PM) each treat the combination of lease and non-lease components in their lease accounting policies, and what does this reveal about their approach to lease classification and financial reporting transparency?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) states that when contracts contain both lease and non-lease components, they account for both as a single lease component. Procter & Gamble (PG) similarly combines lease and non-lease components for the purpose of calculating lease liabilities, particularly for real estate and vehicle leases. In contrast, Philip Morris (PM) generally accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component but makes an exception for vehicle leases, where they account for the lease components separately from the non-lease components. This reveals that while all three companies follow a generally consistent policy of combining components in most cases, PM introduces a notable distinction for vehicle leases, suggesting a more nuanced or segmented approach to lease classification and reporting.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nWhen deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk. All derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid ex penses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The cash flow impact of the Company's derivative instruments is primarily included in our consolidated statement of cash flows in net cash provided by operating activities. Refer to Note 5.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at its inception based on whether or not the Company has the right to control the asset during the contract period and other facts and circumstances. We are the lessee in a lease contract when we obtain the right to control the asset. Operating lease right-of-use ('ROU') assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease and are included in the line items accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. When determining the lease term, we include renewal or termination options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in our consolidated statement of income. As the rates implicit in our leases are not readily determinable, we use our local incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. When our contracts contain lease and non-lease components, we account for both components as a single lease component. Refer to Note 10.\n\nWe have various contracts for certain fountain equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend economic life are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is recorded principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets, which are reviewed periodically and generally have the following ranges: buildings and improvements: 40 years or less; and machinery and equipment: 20 years or less. Land is not depreciated, and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term, including renewal options that we are reasonably certain to exercise, or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Depreciation is not recorded during the period in which a long-lived asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale, even if the asset or disposal group continues to generate revenue during the period. Depreciation expense, including the depreciation expense of assets under finance leases, totaled $997 million, $1,018 million and $1,125 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Amortization expense for leasehold improvements totaled $17 million, $14 million and $13 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.",

          "chunk_text": "## Income taxes\n\nIncome  taxes  are  provided  on  all  earnings  for  jurisdictions  outside  the  United  States. These  provisions,  as  well  as  state  and  local  income  tax   provisions,  are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in PMI's consolidated balance sheets. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. PMI recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the  provision  for  income  tax es  on  the  consolidated  statements  of  earnings. PMI  recognizes  income  tax es  associated  with  G lobal  Intangible  Low-Tax ed  Income (\"GILTI\") taxes as current period expense rather than including these amounts in the measurement of deferred taxes.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The first-in, first-out and average cost methods are used to cost substantially all inventories. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset, although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the aging process, ordinarily would not be utilized within one year.\n\n## Leases\n\nPMI determines that a contract contains a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange  for consideration. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is amortized based on production activity or the  lease  term. Lease ex pense is recorded in cost of sales or marketing, administration and research costs depending on the nature of the leased item. At lease commencement, PMI recognizes lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets (at the present value of future payments) for predominately all of its leases. The recognition of the right-of-use asset and lease liability includes renewal options when it is reasonably certain that they will be ex ercised. Certain of PMI's leases include payments that are based on changes to an index or on actual usage. These lease payments are adjusted periodically and are included within variable lease costs. PMI accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single-lease component with the exception of its vehicle leases, of which PMI accounts for the lease components separately from the nonlease components. Additionally, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability on the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Marketing costs\n\nPMI supports its products with advertising, adult consumer engagement and trade promotions. Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, rebates, instore display incentives, e-commerce, mobile and other digital platforms, adult consumer activation and promotion activities, as well as costs associated with adult consumer experience outlets and other adult consumer touchpoints and volume-based incentives. Advertising, as well as certain consumer engagement and trade activities costs, are ex pensed as incurred. Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers at the end of a period, based principally on historical utilization. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and certain consumer engagement expenses are charged to earnings based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nPMI recognizes revenue primarily through the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products. The majority of PMI revenues are generated by sales through direct and indirect distribution networks with short-term payment conditions and where control is typically transferred to the customer either upon shipment or delivery of goods. PMI evaluates the transfer of control through evidence of the customer's receipt and acceptance, transfer of title, PMI's right to payment for those products and the customer's ability to direct the use of those products upon receipt.  Typically, PMI's performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of goods.\n\nIn certain instances, PMI facilitates shipping and handling activities after control has transferred to the customer. PMI has elected to record all shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill a contract. The shipping and handling costs that have not been incurred at the time revenue is recognized are accrued.  PMI is a principal for majority of its arrangements and recognizes revenue at the transaction price, with the associated costs recorded in cost of sales. The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration, where applicable. Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers, historical experience of discount or rebate redemption, where relevant, and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories  evolve. For arrangements where PMI acts as an agent, the net commission earned is recognized as revenue. PMI has elected to exclude excise taxes collected from customers from the measurement of the transaction price, thereby presenting revenues net of excise taxes. Estimated costs associated with warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive highlights that product quality issues could arise from raw material and product availability or safety concerns, particularly due to reliance on single-source suppliers and global supply chain disruptions. Costco indirectly ties product quality risks to its ability to consistently provide high-quality and innovative products, which is essential to maintaining comparable sales and member satisfaction, especially in high-volume markets like California. Mondelez explicitly lists 'perceived or actual product quality issues or product recalls' as a key risk factor that could materially affect its financial condition and results of operations. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are exposed to product quality risks, Colgate emphasizes supply chain integrity, Costco focuses on product innovation and consistency, and Mondelez directly ties quality issues to financial and operational risk.",

If any planned divestiture is not able to be completed, we may also incur negative business and financial results.\n\n## Operational Risks\n\n## Our business results are impacted by our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain and/or key office facilities.\n\nWe are engaged in the manufacture and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale. Our operations and those of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or logistics providers have been and may continue to be disrupted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\n- geopolitical events, wars and military conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and the conflict in Middle East;\n- widespread health emergencies, such as pandemics or epidemics;\n- strikes and other labor disputes;\n- disruptions in logistics;\n- loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites;\n- loss of key suppliers or contract manufacturers;\n- capacity constraints;\n- raw material and product availability and/or quality or safety issues;\n- industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues;\n- the impact on our suppliers of tighter credit or capital markets;\n- the lack of availability of qualified personnel, such as truck drivers and production labor;\n- governmental incentives, regulations and controls (including import and export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers); and\n- natural disasters, including climatic events (including any potential effects of climate change) and earthquakes, tornadoes, acts of war or terrorism, political unrest or uncertainty, fires or ex plosions, cybersecurity incidents and other external factors over which we have no control.\n\nIn addition, we purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and/or Colgate standards, which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time. If our existing or new suppliers fail to meet such standards or if we are unable to contract with suppliers on favorable terms, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that the supplies of raw and packaging materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate. In addition, we have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and contract manufacturers and the supply of raw and packaging materials. Nonetheless, a significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any reason, including those mentioned above, have at times interrupted and could in the future interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.",

We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.  These  Risk  Factors should be carefully rev iewed in conjunction with  Management ' s  Discussion  and Analysis  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report.\n\n## Business and Operating Risks\n\n## We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.\n\nOur financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 86% and 85% of net sales and operating income in 2024. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 27% of U.S. net sales in 2024. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher v olume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adv ersely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S. operations,  particularly  in  California,  and  our  Canadian  operations  could  arise  from,  among  other  things:  slow  growth  or  declines  in  comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negativ e trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher lev els of unemployment and depressed home v alues; and failing to consistently prov ide high quality and innov ativ e new products.\n\nWe may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets, and integrating acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots, as well as  local  community  actions  opposed  to  the  location  of  our  warehouses  or  depots  at  specific  sites  and  the  adoption  of  local  laws  restricting  our operations and env ironmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions hav e enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prev ent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to effectiv ely manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could hav e a material adv erse effect on our future growth and profitability.\n\nWe  seek  to  expand  in  existing  markets  to  attain  a  greater  ov erall  market  share.  A  new  warehouse  may  draw  members  away  from  our  existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance, member traffic, and profitability.\n\nWe intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. We cannot  ensure  that  new  warehouses  and  new  e-commerce  sites  will  be  profitable  and  future  profitability  could  be  delayed  or  otherwise  materially adversely affected.",

      "answer": "MDLZ highlights the increasing costs and operational challenges of protecting against sophisticated cyber threats, noting that cybersecurity insurance may become harder to obtain on favorable terms. They also emphasize the complexity and rising costs of complying with multijurisdictional privacy laws like GDPR, which could impose penalties of up to 4% of global annual revenue for non-compliance. PG, while not providing specific figures, underscores the operational and reputational risks associated with cybersecurity incidents, particularly in the context of third-party relationships and the need to maintain secure and functional technology systems. WMT acknowledges the growing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks, noting that these threats have already impacted their systems and those of third-party providers.

Moreov er, as cyberattacks increase in frequency and magnitude around the world, we may be unable to obtain cybersecurity insurance in the amounts and on terms we v iew as appropriate and fav orable for our operations.\n\nWe transfer data across local, regional, and national borders to conduct our operations, and we are subject to a v ariety of continuously ev olv ing and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding priv acy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. Priv acy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') has greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of E.U. law , added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, and imposes substantial penalties for non-compliance of up to 4% of global annual rev enue for the preceding financial year in addition to potential restrictions on data transfer and processing. Our efforts to comply with multijurisdictional priv acy and data protection laws and the uncertainty of new laws and regulations will likely increase the complexity of our processes and may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase ov er time, and we could incur substantial penalties or be subject to litigation related to v iolation of existing or future data priv acy laws and regulations.\n\n## We are subject to risks from unanticipated business disruptions.\n\nWe manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale. We utilize an interdependent supply chain - a complex network of suppliers and material needs, owned and leased manufacturing locations, external manufacturing partners, distribution networks, shared serv ice deliv ery centers and information systems that support our ability to prov ide our products to our customers consistently. Factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, like  weather,  natural  disasters,  water  and  energy  av ailability,  supply  and  commodity  shortages,  port  congestions  or  delays,  transport  capacity constraints,  terrorism,  political  unrest  or  armed  hostilities  (including  the  ongoing  war  in  Ukraine  and  conflicts  in  the  Middle  East),  cybersecurity incidents, labor shortages, strikes or work stoppages, new or increased tariffs and/or trade barriers, operational and/or financial instability of our key suppliers and other v endors or serv ice prov iders, gov ernment shutdowns or health pandemics, including any potential impact of climate change on these factors,  could  damage  or  disrupt  our  operations  or  those  of  our  suppliers,  their  suppliers,  our  external  manufacturing  partners,  distributors  or  other business partners.  Failure  to  effectiv ely  prepare  for  and  respond  to  disruptions  in  our  operations,  for  example,  by  not  finding  alternativ e  suppliers  or replacing capacity at key or sole manufacturing or distribution locations or by not quickly repairing damage to our information, production or supply systems,  can  cause  delays  in  deliv ering  or  the  inability  to  deliv er  products  to  our  customers,  and  the  quality  and  safety  of  our  products  might  be negativ ely  affected.  Moreov er ,  disputes  with  significant  customers  or  suppliers,  including  disputes  regarding  pricing  or  performance,  could  adv ersely affect our sales, financial condition, and results of operations. T he occurrence of a material or extended disruption may cause us to lose our customers' or business partners' confidence or suffer damage to our reputation, and long-term consumer demand for our products could decline. We use insurance to transfer our financial risk related to these exposures, but some of the risks we face are difficult or impossible to insure and the timing of insurance recoveries may not match the timing of the financial loss we incur. We are subject to risk related to operational safety, including risk of fire, explosion or accidental  contamination.  We  could  also  fail  to  achiev e  our  strategic  objectiv es  due  to  capability  or  technology  deficiencies  related  to  our  ongoing reconfiguration of our supply chain to driv e efficiencies and fuel growth. Further, our ability to supply multiple markets with a streamlined manufacturing footprint  may  be  negativ ely  impacted  by  portfolio  complexity,  significant  changes  in  trade  policies,  changes  in  v olume  produced  and  changes  to regulatory restrictions or labor-related or other constraints on our ability to adjust production capacity in the markets in which we operate. T hese ev ents could materially and adv ersely affect our product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\n\n## We may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.\n\nWe regularly ev aluate a v ariety of potential strategic transactions globally, including acquisitions, div estitures, joint v entures, equity method inv estments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectiv es, and acquisitions and joint v entures are an important part of our strategy to increase our exposure to fast-growing snacking segments, fill geographic white spaces and expand into adjacent categories. For example, in 2024 we sold  our  remaining  equity  inv estment  in  JDE  Peet's  N.V.  and  acquired  Ev irth  (Shanghai)  Industrial  Co.,  Ltd.  In  2023,  we  completed  the  sale  of  our developed market gum business in the United States, Canada and Europe and sold our remaining equity inv estment in Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., and in 2022 we acquired Chipita Global S.A.,",

We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. We continue to invest in AI and generative AI technologies to enhance our customers' shopping experience and our associate work experience and to improve efficiencies of our supply chain, operations, management functions and talent recruitment and development; however, these are evolving technologies and there are inherent operational and legal complexities associated with implementation of these technologies within our business. When integrating and introducing AI and generative AI technologies into our platforms, processes and systems, we may be exposed to new or expanded liabilities and risks due to elevated governmental scrutiny and monitoring, litigation, data privacy risks and compliance issues in a disparate and at times conflicting regulatory environment, all of which could negatively affect our financial performance and business reputation.\n\nSome of the various technology systems and services on which we rely are provided and managed by an increasing number of third-party service providers. To the extent either our or such other third-party systems and services do not perform or function as anticipated, whether because of an inherent flaw in the technology, faulty implementation or a cybersecurity incident, such failure can significantly interfere with our ability to meet our customers' changing ex pectations. Any disruption or failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly and secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise and services at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology in a cost-efficient manner could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nAny failure to maintain the privacy or security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates, business partners and vendors, whether as a result of cyberattacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, result in fines, penalties, and liability, cause us to incur substantial additional costs and materially adv ersely affect our business and operating results.\n\nLike most retailers, we process in our information systems personal information and/or payment information about our customers and members, and we also process information concerning our associates and vendors. In addition, our health and wellness business operations and third-party service providers who handle information on our behalf store and maintain protected health information. Further, we recently acquired VIZIO Holding Corp. and its subsidiaries, which collects certain consumer data, including certain television viewing data. Some of this information is stored digitally in connection with the digital platforms and technologies that we use to conduct and facilitate our various businesses. We utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, compute capacity, medical record documentation, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates, business partners or vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.\n\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for disrupting or obtaining access to information systems or information stored in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent, and in some cases, they may lead to successful attacks. Unauthorized activities directed against information systems and devices, whether our own or those of our third-party service providers and vendors, have resulted in cybersecurity incidents, including malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks or phishing incidents. We expect that our information systems and those of our third-party service providers, vendors and suppliers will continue to experience such attacks in the future, which could include disruptions to our supply chain system. Cyberattacks and threat actors can be sponsored by particular nation-states, or be the work of sophisticated criminal organizations, insiders (including our associates or contractors) or third parties, each with a wide-range of motives and expertise. We and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience incidents and threats to data and information systems. These incidents and threats have included and are likely to continue to include both random and targeted cyberattacks, computer viruses, phishing incidents, worms, bot attacks, ransomware or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card and payment information, and cause system failures and disruptions. The use of remote work infrastructure in recent years has also increased the possible attack surfaces to be ex ploited. Our logging capabilities, or the logging capabilities of third parties, are also not always complete or sufficiently detailed, affecting our ability to fully investigate and understand the scope of security events. As noted above, some of our information systems and those of our third-party service providers have experienced cybersecurity incidents or breaches, including during fiscal 2025, and, although to date they have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results or business, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future.\n\nOur digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run, including those applications and systems used in legacy operations and acquired eCommerce, technology or other businesses, are regularly subject to cyberattacks.

We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for  concentrate,  finished  goods  and Aquafina  royalties  and  specify  the  manufacturing  process  required  for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas.\n\nWe rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to  the  consumer.  For  our  independent  distributors  and  retailers,  these  incentives  include  volumebased  rebates,  product  placement  fees,  promotions  and  displays.  For  our  independent  bottlers,  these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and promotions, and  other  promotional  offers.  Advertising  support  is  directed  at  advertising  programs  and  supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace  support,  such  as  point-of-purchase  materials,  product  placement  fees,  media  and  advertising. Vending  and  cooler  equipment  placement  programs  support  the  acquisition  and  placement  of  vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually.\n\nChanges to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the continued growth of  sales  through  e-commerce  websites  and  mobile  commerce  applications,  including  through  subscription services  and  other  direct-to-consumer  businesses,  the  integration  of  physical  and  digital  operations  among retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard discounters, and the current economic environment, including in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2021,  sales  to  Walmart  Inc.  (Walmart)  and  its  affiliates,  including  Sam's  Club  (Sam's),  represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue, with sales reported across all of our divisions, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our FLNA, QFNA and PBNA divisions.\n\n## Our Competition\n\nOur beverage and convenient food products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies,  as  well  as  regional,  local  and  private  label  manufacturers  and  economy  brands  and  other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In many countries in which our  products  are  sold,  including  the  United  States,  The  Coca-Cola  Company  is  our  primary  beverage competitor. Other beverage and convenient food competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Hormel Foods Corporation, Kellogg Company, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft  Heinz  Company,  Link  Snacks,  Inc.,  Mondel\u0113z  International,  Inc.,  Monster  Beverage  Corporation, Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Utz Brands, Inc.\n\nMany of our convenient food products hold significant leadership positions in the convenient food industry in the United States and worldwide.

          "chunk_text": "## Business Strategy\n\nTo achieve our business and financial objectives, we are focused on driving organic sales growth and long-term profitable growth through innovation on our core businesses; leveraging faster growth in adjacent categories; expanding in high-growth channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. We are also seeking to maximize the impact of our ESG programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and DE&amp;I strategies, which we are working to integrate across our organization. We are strengthening our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, eCommerce and data and analytics enabling us to be more responsive in today's rapidly changing world. In particular, we believe our digital transformation is of paramount importance to our success going forward. We continue to invest behind our brands, including through advertising, and to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and eCommerce retailers. We also continue to broaden our eCommerce offerings, including direct-to-consumer and subscription services. We continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products.\n\nWe are also changing the way we work to drive growth and how we approach innovation with focus, empowerment, experimentation and digitization to respond to the dynamic retail landscape and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers. The retail landscape, the ease of new entrants into the market in many of our categories and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers demand that we work differently and faster in an agile, authentic and culturally relevant manner to drive innovation.\n\nThe investments needed to drive growth are supported through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding-the-growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. We also continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses, including by expanding our portfolio in premium skin health.\n\nOn January 27, 2022, the Board approved a targeted productivity program (the '2022 Global Productivity Initiative'). The program is intended to reallocate resources towards our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in our operations and streamline our supply chain to reduce structural costs. Implementation of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, which is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2022, is projected to result in cumulative pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $200 and $240, which are currently estimated to be comprised of the following: employee-related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (80%); asset-related costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs (10%); and other charges (10%), which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies. It is estimated that approximately 90% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. For more information regarding the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, see 'Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges' below.\n\n## Significant Items Impacting Comparability\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a non-cash charge of $571 pretax ($518 aftertax) to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible related to the Filorga skin health business. The impairment was due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Filorga business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. See Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\nIn 1990, our Canadian subsidiary ('CP Canada'), issued C$145 of Canadian dollar-denominated unsecured unsubordinated 12.85% guaranteed notes due October 4, 2030 (the 'Canada notes'). In the third quarter of 2021, CP Canada redeemed the Canada notes and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $75 pretax ($55 aftertax), which is included in Interest (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.",

MDLZ shows a significant $1.759 billion gain from commodity contracts in 2024, contributing positively to cost of sales and suggesting a more favorable hedging or procurement strategy. PEP, on the other hand, shows a $57 million unrealized loss in 2024 on commodity contracts within accumulated other comprehensive loss, signaling potential future earnings volatility once these amounts are reclassified into earnings.

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive had $1,204 million in commercial paper outstanding and $3,457 million in unused domestic and foreign lines of credit as of December 31, 2021, indicating a conservative liquidity approach with significant unused capacity. Coca-Cola had $2,462 million in commercial paper outstanding and $9,972 million in unused lines of credit, suggesting a more aggressive use of short-term financing while maintaining substantial backup liquidity. PepsiCo had only $38 million in international debt tied to various lines of credit, reflecting a much more limited reliance on short-term borrowings compared to its peers. The differences suggest that while all three maintained strong liquidity positions, Colgate emphasized financial flexibility through conservative borrowing, Coca-Cola maintained the largest unused credit capacity for potential deployment, and PepsiCo took a more restrained approach to short-term debt.",

These redemptions were financed with commercial paper borrowings and cash. The Company recorded a loss on this early extinguishment of debt of $23, which is included in Interest (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $3,457 (including under the facility discussed below) and could also issue long-term debt pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In August 2021, the Company entered into a new $3,000 five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for a five-year term expiring August 2026, which replaced, on substantially similar terms, the Company's $2,650 revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in November 2024. Commitment fees related to the credit facility were not material. The Company's $1,500 364-day credit facility with a syndicate of banks expired in August 2021 and was not renewed.\n\nDomestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $1,204 and $1,389 as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding of commercial paper in 2021 and 2020 were $2,052 and $1,050, respectively. The Company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its available lines of credit (under the facilities discussed above).\n\nThe following is a summary of the Company's commercial paper and global short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\n",

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $2,462 million and $1,329 million, respectively, in outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Our weighted-average interest rates for commercial paper outstanding were approximately 0.1 percent and 1.3 percent as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company also had $845 million and $854 million, respectively, in lines of credit, short-term credit facilities and other short-term borrowings that were related to our international operations.\n\nIn addition, we had $9,972 million in unused lines of credit and other short-term credit facilities as of December 31, 2021, of which $8,060 million was in corporate backup lines of credit for general purposes. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2022 through 2027. There were no borrowings under these corporate backup lines of credit during 2021. These credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. Some of the financial arrangements require compensating balances, none of which is presently significant to our Company.\n\n## Long-Term Debt\n\nDuring 2021, the Company issued fixed interest rate U.S. dollar- and euro-denominated notes of $5,950 million and \u20ac3,150 million, respectively, with maturity dates ranging from 2028 to 2051 and interest rates ranging from 0.125 percent to 3.000 percent. The carrying value of these notes as of December 31, 2021 was $9,410 million.\n\nDuring 2021, the Company retired upon maturity variable interest rate euro-denominated notes of \u20ac371 million with an interest rate equal to the three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate ('EURIBOR') plus 0.200 percent.\n\nDuring 2021, the Company also extinguished prior to maturity fixed interest rate U.S. dollar- and euro-denominated notes of $6,500 million and \u20ac2,430 million, respectively, with maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2026 and interest rates ranging from 0.750 percent to 3.200 percent. These extinguishments resulted in associated charges of $559 million recorded in the line item interest expense in our consolidated statement of income. These charges included the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying value of the notes extinguished, including the impact of the related fair value hedging relationships. We also incurred charges of $91 million as a result of the reclassification of related cash flow hedging balances from AOCI into income.\n\nDuring 2020, the Company issued fixed interest rate U.S. dollar- and euro-denominated notes of $15,600 million and \u20ac2,600 million, respectively, with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2060 and interest rates ranging from 0.125 percent to 4.200 percent. The carrying value of these notes as of December 31, 2020 was $17,616 million.\n\nDuring 2020, the Company retired upon maturity fixed interest rate Australian dollar- and U.S. dollar-denominated notes of AUD450 million and $3,750 million, respectively, with interest rates ranging from 1.875 percent to 3.150 percent. Additionally, the Company retired upon maturity U.S. dollar zero coupon notes of $171 million.\n\nDuring 2020, the Company also extinguished prior to maturity fixed interest rate U.S. dollar- and euro-denominated notes of $3,815 million and \u20ac2,300 million, respectively, with maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2050 and interest rates ranging from",

Target, in contrast, uses LIFO under the retail inventory method for the vast majority of its inventory, which totaled $13.9 billion as of January 29, 2022.

Advertising costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred. Certain consumer and trade promotional programs, such as consumer coupons, are recorded as a reduction of sales.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe cost of approximately 75% of inventories is determined using the FIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of all other inventories, in the U.S. and Mexico, is determined using the LIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories in excess of one year of forecasted sales are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent 'Other assets.'\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nLand, buildings and machinery and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided, primarily using the straight-line method, over-estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings. Depreciation attributable to manufacturing operations is included in Cost of sales. The remaining component of depreciation is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangibles\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the Company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Other intangible assets with finite lives, such as local brands and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 40 years. Amortization expense related to intangible assets is included in Other (income) expense, net, which is included in Operating profit.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect at the time such differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\nThe Company uses a comprehensive model to recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on an income tax return.

The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost in future years.\n\n- Environmental Costs: Altria is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Altria provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change.\n\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation and compliance costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows. See Note 18. Contingencies -Environmental Regulation .\n\n- Fair Value Measurements: Altria measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Altria uses a fair value hierarchy, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are:\n- Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n- Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n- Guarantees: Altria recognizes a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities. See Note 18 . Contingencies for a further discussion of guarantees.\n- Income Taxes: Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Altria records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Altria determines the realizability of deferred tax assets based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence. In reaching this determination, Altria considers the character of the assets and the possible sources of taxable income of the appropriate character within the available carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law.\n\nAltria recognizes the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Altria recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\n- Inventories: The last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method is used to determine the cost of substantially all tobacco inventories. The cost of the remaining inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') and average cost methods. Inventories that are measured using the LIFO method are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories that are measured using the FIFO and average cost methods are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco and wine inventories as current assets although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the curing and aging process, ordinarily would not be used within one year. The cost of approximately 81% and 59% of inventories at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was determined using the LIFO method. The increase in LIFO percentage was due to the Ste. Michelle Transaction (as Ste. Michelle accounted for its inventory using FIFO). The stated LIFO amounts of inventories were approximately $0.6 billion lower than the current cost of inventories at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n- Investments in Equity Securities: Investments in equity securities in which Altria has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or the fair value option. The election of the fair value option is irrevocable and is made on an investment by investment basis.\n\nAltria elected to account for its investments in ABI and Cronos under the equity method of accounting. Altria's share of equity (income) losses and other adjustments associated with these equity investments are included in (income) losses from equity investments in the consolidated statements of earnings (losses). The carrying value for each of Altria's equity investments in ABI and Cronos is reported in",

          "chunk_text": "## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nOur  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  which  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  apply judgments that  affect  the  reported  amounts.  In  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  we  describe  the  significant accounting  policies  used  in  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  management  has  discussed  the  development, selection,  and  disclosure  of  our  critical  accounting  estimates  with  the  Audit  &amp;  Risk  Committee  of  our  Board  of  Directors.  The following items require significant estimation or judgment:\n\nInventory and cost of sales: The vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO). Our inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Market adjustments for markdowns are  recorded  when  the  salability  of  the  merchandise  has  diminished.  Salability  can  be  impacted  by  consumer  preferences  and seasonality, among other factors. We believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns  in  less  than  three  months.  Inventory  was  $13.9  billion  and  $10.7  billion  as  of  January  29,  2022,  and  January  30,  2021, respectively, and is further described in Note 10 to the Financial Statements.\n\nVendor income: We  receive various forms of consideration from our vendors (vendor income), principally earned as a result of volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and advertising allowances. Substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction  of  cost  of  sales.  Vendor  income  earned  can  vary  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  purchase  volumes,  sales volumes, and our pricing and promotion strategies.\n\nWe  establish  a  receivable  for  vendor  income  that  is  earned  but  not  yet  received.  Based  on  historical  trending  and  data,  this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collections and estimating the amount earned. The majority of the year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $518 million and $504 million as of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, respectively. Vendor income is described further in Note 6 to the Financial Statements.\n\nLong-lived assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed primarily at the store level. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or eventual disposition of the asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount, and is measured as the excess of its carrying amount over fair value. We estimate fair value by obtaining market appraisals, obtaining valuations from third-party brokers, or using other valuation techniques. We recorded impairments of $87  million,  $62  million,  and  $23  million  in  2021,  2020,  and  2019,  respectively,  which  are  described  further  in  Note  12  to  the Financial Statements.\n\nInsurance/self-insurance: We  retain  a  substantial  portion  of  the  risk  related  to  certain  general  liability,  workers'  compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to  certain  risks.  Liabilities  associated  with  these  losses  include  estimates  of  both  claims  filed  and  losses  incurred  but  not  yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $519 million and $510 million as of January 29, 2022, and  January  30,  2021,  respectively.  We  believe  that  the  amounts  accrued  are  appropriate;  however,  our  liabilities  could  be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would have impacted our self-insurance expense by $26 million in 2021. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Part II,  Item  7A,  Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Disclosures  About  Market  Risk,  for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. We maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters.\n\n2021 Form 10-K",

Such risks may be increased if government officials make public statements about alleged risks purportedly associated with processing, particular ingredients used in our products, or unintentional contaminants that may be present in the food or water supply. In addition, increasing public concern about processing or the perceived or potential health consequences of processing, the presence of ingredients or substances in our beverage products or in packaging materials (or alleged presence of substances such as PFAS), and/or the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid) purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain products, or ingredients or substances present in certain of our products or packaging materials, have resulted, and could result, in additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our beverages; limitations on the use of certain ingredients or packaging; potential new or increased taxes on or fees associated with our beverages by government entities; and negative publicity, or actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry, all of which could damage the reputation of, and may reduce demand for, our beverage products.\n\n## If we are not successful in our efforts to digitalize the Coca-Cola system, our financial results could be negatively affected.\n\nThe digital evolution is affecting how we interact with consumers, customers, suppliers, bottlers and other business partners and stakeholders. We believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to adapt to and thrive in the digital environment and ex pand our digital capabilities. Therefore, one of our top priorities is to digitalize the Coca-Cola system by, among other things, creating more relevant and more personalized experiences wherever our system interacts with consumers, whether in a digital environment or through digital devices in an otherwise physical environment; finding ways to create more powerful digital tools and capabilities for the Coca-Cola system's retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses; and digitalizing operations through the use of data, artificial intelligence, automation, robotics and digital devices to increase efficiency and productivity. If we are not successful in our efforts to digitalize the Coca-Cola system, our ability to increase sales and improve margins may be negatively affected, and the cost and expenses we have incurred or may incur in connection with our digitalization initiatives may adversely impact our financial performance.\n\n## If negative publicity, whether or not warranted, concerning product safety or quality, workplace and human rights, obesity or other issues damages our brand image, corporate reputation and social license to operate, our business may suffer.\n\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the brand image of our existing products, build the brand image for new products and brand extensions, and maintain our corporate reputation and social license to operate. However, our continuing investment in advertising and marketing and our strong commitment to product safety and quality and human rights have not always had, and may not in the future always have, the desired impact on our products' brand image and on consumer preferences. Product safety or quality issues, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. In some emerging markets, the production and sale of counterfeit or 'spurious' products, which we and our bottling partners have not in the past been able, and may not in the future be able, to fully combat, may damage the image and reputation of our products. In addition, from time to time we and our executives have engaged, and may in the future engage, in public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business operations and the general economic climate affecting the Company. These engagements in public policy debates have been, and could in the future be, the subject of criticism from advocacy groups or others that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, our sponsorship relationships and associations with influencers and organizations have subjected us in the past, and could subject us in the future, to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals, hosts or entities associated with organizations we sponsor or support financially or through in-kind contributions, as well as by the influencers we collaborate with who may engage in actions or ex press opinions that may negatively reflect on our brand. Likewise, campaigns by activists or others connecting us, or our bottling system or supply chain, with issues related to workplace policies and initiatives, or human rights or animal welfare, whether actual or perceived, could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. Additionally, negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands, even if inaccurate or malicious, have in the past, and could in the future, generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. Furthermore, allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting internationally recognized human rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable workplace and labor laws, including child labor laws, or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers, joint venture partners or other business partners to engage in proper animal welfare practices; and adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products, water usage, environmental impact, labor relations or the like could present potential legal risks and negatively affect our Company's overall reputation and brand image, and could result in product boycotts or have a negative impact on our products' acceptance by consumers. In addition, if we fail to respect our employees' and our supply chain workers' human rights, or inadvertently discriminate against any group of employees or hiring prospects, we could face legal risks and/or our ability to hire and retain the best talent will be diminished, which could have an adverse impact on our overall business.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nresearch on legislation and regulation. Scientific determinations as to any health risks or negative health consequences associated with the use of e-vapor and other innovative tobacco products could materially adversely affect our innovative tobacco products businesses and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\nMost jurisdictions within the United States have restricted smoking in public places and some have restricted vaping in public places. Some public health groups have called for, and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed, bans on smoking and vaping in outdoor places, in private apartments and in cars transporting children.\n\n- Other Legislation or Governmental Initiatives: In addition to the actions discussed above, other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions. For ex ample, in recent years, legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards; establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities; restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes; prohibit the sale of tobacco products based on environmental concerns; impose responsibility on manufacturers for the disposal, recycling or other treatment of post-consumer goods such as plastic packaging; require tax stamping of smokeless tobacco products; require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology; and further restrict the sale, marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds, which may or may not be successful. In addition, if a pandemic or similar health emergency occurs, state and local governments may reimpose additional health and safety requirements for all businesses, which could result in the potential temporary closure of certain businesses and facilities. It is possible that tobacco manufacturing and other facilities and the facilities of our suppliers, our suppliers' suppliers and our trade partners could be subject to additional government-mandated temporary closures and restrictions.\n\nIt is not possible to predict what, if any, additional legislation, regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented (and, if challenged, upheld) relating to the manufacturing, design, packaging, marketing, advertising, sale or use of tobacco products, or the tobacco industry generally. Any such legislation, regulation or other governmental action could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n- Governmental Investigations: From time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. For example, we currently are, or recently have been, subject to a number of governmental investigations with respect to our former investment in JUUL, which we divested in March 2023, including the following: (i) the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') issued a Civil Investigative Demand to us while conducting its antitrust review of our former investment in JUUL; (ii) the SEC commenced an investigation relating to our acquisition, disclosures and accounting controls in connection with the JUUL investment; and (iii) the New York State Office of the Attorney General and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General, separately, issued independent subpoenas to us seeking documents relating to our former investment in and provision of services to JUUL. For a discussion of our disposition of our former investment in JUUL, see Note 8.\n\nIn April 2023, January 2024, February 2024 and April 2024, we agreed to settle the lawsuits relating to our former investment in JUUL initiated by the attorneys general of Minnesota, Alaska, Hawaii and New Mexico, respectively.\n\n## Private Sector Activity on Tobacco Products\n\nA number of retailers, including national chains, have discontinued the sale of all tobacco products, and others have discontinued the sale of e-vapor products. Reasons for the discontinuation include change in corporate policy and, with respect to e-vapor products, reported illnesses and the uncertain regulatory environment. Furthermore, third-party digital platforms, such as app stores, have restricted, and in some cases prohibited, communications with adult tobacco consumers concerning tobacco products. It is possible that if this private sector activity becomes more widespread it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products\n\nIllicit trade in tobacco products has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our businesses, including the sales volumes and market shares of our operating companies' innovative and smoke-free products and traditional tobacco products. Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products that do not comply with the FSPTCA and FDA regulations; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untax ed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit disposable e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products may be designed to appeal to youth and are manufactured without scientific standards, exposing consumers to undocumented risks. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment we have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes, imposing",

Inflation pressures sometimes result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results depend, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations and to anticipate consumer reaction to our management of these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.\n\nThe consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry into certain categories and growth in hard discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to  successfully  manage  relationships  with  our  retail  trade  customers,  which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers, private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if the Company or one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients, negative perceptions of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleum-based materials), lack of recyclability  or  other  environmental  attributes,  concerns  about  actual  or  alleged  labor  or  equality  and  inclusion  practices,  privacy  failures  or  data  breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted, and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer. Our Company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental sustainability.

Our  business  will  be  adversely  affected  if  we  are  unable  to  maintain  and  develop  successful relationships with e-commerce retailers and hard discounters, while also maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels (many of whom are also focused on increasing their ecommerce sales). Our business can be adversely affected if e-commerce channels and hard discounters take significant  additional  market  share  away  from  traditional  retailers  or  we  fail  to  find  ways  to  create increasingly  better  digital  tools  and  capabilities  for  our  retail  customers  to  enable  them  to  grow  their businesses. In addition, our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities. The retail industry is also impacted by increased consolidation of ownership and purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America, resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, impacting our ability to compete in these areas. Consolidation also adversely impacts our smaller customers' ability to compete effectively, resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products. Further, we must  maintain  mutually  beneficial  relationships  with  our  key  customers,  including  Walmart,  to  compete effectively. Any  inability  to  resolve  a  significant  dispute  with  any  of  our  key  customers,  a  change  in  the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction  in  sales  to  any  key  customer,  or  the  loss  of  any  of  our  key  customers  can  adversely  affect  our business.\n\n## Disruption of our manufacturing operations or supply chain, including increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs, can adversely affect our business.\n\nWe  have  experienced  and  could  continue  to  experience  disruption  in  our  manufacturing  operations  and supply chain. Many of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are sourced from countries  experiencing  civil  unrest,  political  instability  or  unfavorable  economic  conditions.  Some  raw materials and supplies, including packaging materials, are available only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. There can be no assurance that  we  will  be  able  to  maintain  favorable  arrangements  and  relationships  with  suppliers  or  that  our contingency plans will be effective to prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any  raw  materials  and  other  supplies  that  we  use  in  the  manufacture,  production  and  distribution  of  our products. Any sustained or significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply, which can adversely impact our business.\n\nThe raw materials and other supplies, including agricultural commodities, fuel and packaging materials, such as  recycled  PET,  transportation,  labor  and  other  supply  chain  inputs  that  we  use  for  the  manufacturing, production  and  distribution  of  our  products  are  subject  to  price  volatility  and  fluctuations  in  availability caused by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, supplier capacity constraints, inflation, weather  conditions  (including  potential  effects  of  climate  change),  fire,  natural  disasters,  disease  or  pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty, health epidemics or pandemics  or  other  contagious  outbreaks  (including  COVID-19),  labor  shortages  (including  the  lack  of availability of truck drivers or as a result of COVID-19), strikes or work stoppages, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), port  congestions  or  delays,  transport  capacity  constraints,  cybersecurity  incidents  or  other disruptions,  loss  or  impairment  of  key  manufacturing  sites,  political  uncertainties,  acts  of  terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation. We experienced higher than anticipated  commodity,  packaging  and  transportation  costs  during  2021,  which  may  continue. When  input prices increase unexpectedly or significantly, we may",

We extended certain benefits to our team members in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, including bonuses, fully-paid  leaves  for  up  to  30  days,  free  back-up  dependent  care,  and  a  variety  of  mental,  emotional,  and  physical  wellness resources. We also enacted dozens of safety, social distancing, and cleaning measures designed to protect our team and guests during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Working Capital\n\nEffective inventory management is key to our ongoing success, and we use various techniques including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. We achieve effective inventory management by staying in-stock in core product offerings, maintaining positive vendor relationships, and carefully planning inventory levels for seasonal and apparel items to minimize markdowns.\n\nThe Liquidity and Capital Resources section in MD&amp;A provides additional details.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete with traditional and internet retailers, including department stores, off-price general merchandise retailers, wholesale clubs, category-specific retailers, drug stores, supermarkets, direct-to-consumer brands, and other forms of retail commerce.

Organic sales growth was led by India, the Philippines, Australia and the Greater China region.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in 2024 versus 2023 was primarily due to an increase in Oral Care organic sales.

          "chunk_text": "We generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as 'structural changes,' which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company's unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's acquisitions and divestitures.\n\n'Acquired brands' refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.\n\n'Licensed brands' refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.\n\nIn January 2023, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Vietnam. The impact of this refranchising has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments. In January, February and December 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in certain territories in India, and in February 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Bangladesh and the Philippines. The impact of each of these refranchisings has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments.\n\nIn May 2023, the Company acquired certain brands in Asia Pacific. The impact of acquiring these brands has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Asia Pacific operating segment.\n\n## Beverage Volume\n\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, 'unit case' means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and 'unit case volume' means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.",

We lease certain real estate, machinery, equipment, vehicles and office equipment for varying periods. Many  of  these  leases  include  an  option  to  either  renew  or terminate the lease.

      "question": "How do Colgate-Palmolive, Coca-Cola, and Walmart each address the risks associated with counterfeit products, and what do their disclosures reveal about the varying impacts on brand equity, consumer trust, and legal liability across their respective business models?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive highlights that counterfeit versions of its products are inferior or may pose safety risks, which could lead to consumer confusion and damage to its brand equity and financial performance. Coca-Cola emphasizes that counterfeit or 'spurious' products in emerging markets may tarnish the image and reputation of its beverage brands, especially when consumers associate these products with the company. Walmart notes that counterfeit or pirated products sold on its third-party marketplace could erode customer trust, expose the company to legal liability, and harm its competitive position and enterprise strategy. Collectively, these disclosures show that while all three companies face reputational risks from counterfeiting, the nature and emphasis of the threat differ: Colgate focuses on brand dilution and safety, Coca-Cola on brand image in global markets, and Walmart on platform liability and customer retention in digital commerce.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) faces a $6.0 billion tax liability including interest, stemming from a Tax Court decision related to transfer pricing in foreign jurisdictions. PepsiCo (PEP) carries forward $34.0 billion in operating loss carryforwards and income tax credits across foreign and state jurisdictions, which can be used to reduce future tax liabilities. Walmart (WMT) highlights exposure to regulatory and tax changes in foreign jurisdictions, particularly noting the impact of the OECD\u2019s Pillar Two initiative, which introduces a 15% global minimum tax effective in many jurisdictions as of January 1, 2024. Synthesizing these perspectives, KO is dealing with legacy tax disputes, PEP is leveraging historical losses for future benefit, and WMT is proactively managing exposure to evolving international tax frameworks.",

Also includes a tax  benefit of $88 million (or a 0.7% impact on our effective tax  rate) associated with the chang e in the Company's indefinite reinvestment assertion for our Philippines and Bang ladesh bottling  operations. 2\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have not recorded incremental income taxes for additional outside basis differences of $9.3 billion in our investments in foreign subsidiaries, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any additional outside basis differences in these entities is not practicable.\n\nThe Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ('GILTI') provisions of the Tax Reform Act require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return each foreign subsidiary's earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary's tangible assets. An accounting policy election is available to either account for the tax effects of G ILTI in the period that is subject to such tax es or to provide deferred tax es for book and tax  basis differences that upon reversal may be subject to such taxes. We have elected to account for the tax effects of these provisions in the period that is subject to such tax  and the impact is reflected in our full year provision.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in all applicable jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal jurisdiction, U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions. U.S. tax  authorities have completed their federal income tax  ex aminations for all years prior to 2007. With respect to U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions, with limited ex ceptions, the Company and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax  audits for years prior to 2007. For U.S. federal and state tax purposes, the net operating losses and tax credit carryovers that were acquired in connection with our acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.'s former North America business and that were generated from 1990 through 2010 are subject to adjustments until the year in which they are utilized is no longer subject to examination. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company believes that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been provided for in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance.\n\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion regarding the Company's 2015 litigation with the IRS involving transfer pricing tax adjustments in which it predominantly sided with the IRS. On November 8, 2023, the Tax Court issued a supplemental opinion, siding with the IRS in concluding both that the blockedincome regulations apply to the Company's operations and that the Tax Court opinion in 3M Co. &amp; Subs. v. Commissioner (February 9, 2023) controlled as to the validity of those regulations. On August 2, 2024, the Tax Court entered a decision reflecting additional federal income tax of $2.7 billion for the 2007 through 2009 tax years. With applicable interest, the total liability for the 2007 through 2009 tax  years resulting from the Tax  Court's decision is $6.0 billion. On October 22, 2024, the Company appealed the Tax Court's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The Company strongly disagrees with the Opinions and intends to vigorously defend its positions. Refer to Note 12.",

Significant changes in tax and trade policies, including tariffs, trade barriers, other restrictions on the ex portation and importation of goods and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions, including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. and international operations as well as our business.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes, other taxes and tax collection and reporting obligations in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax  rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax  assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, tax  rates, regulations or accounting principles and the interpretations of those rules. In addition, we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date of those obligations.\n\nWe are also exposed to future tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and changes in administrative interpretations of ex isting tax  laws, and changes in transfer pricing arrangements with our subsidiaries, any of which can impact our or our subsidiaries' current and future years' tax provision. The effect of such changes in tax law, changes in administrative interpretations of existing tax  laws or changes in transfer pricing arrangements could also have a material effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In the U.S., the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax  Act\") significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax Act and any other new tax rules, regulations, guidance and interpretations, including collecting information not regularly produced by us or unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of operations.\n\nIn addition, legislatures and tax ing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to or seek to enforce novel interpretations of their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent changes. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the \"OECD\"), the European Union and other countries (including countries in which we operate) have committed to enacting substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax principles impacting how large multinational enterprises are taxed. In particular, the OECD's Pillar Two initiative introduces a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis, which became effective in many jurisdictions in which we operate starting January 1, 2024. The impact of these potential new rules as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax rules and regulations could have a material effect on our effective tax rate.\n\nFurthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations, legislation and interpretations. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made.\n\n## Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws, regulations and interpretations of such laws and regulations specific to the businesses and jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our reputation, market position or our business and financial performance.\n\nWe operate in complex regulated environments in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate and could be materially adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements, including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. In addition, the degree of regulatory, political, and media scrutiny we face increases the likelihood that our efforts to adhere to our practices and procedures to comply with these laws and legal requirements may be subject to frequent or increasing challenges. If we fail to prevent independent contractors or third-party service providers from violating our policies or applicable laws or committing any fraudulent acts against us or our customers, it could harm our business or damage our reputation, and we could face liability for unlawful activities by such third parties.\n\nOur health and wellness operations in the U.S. are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to, those related to: licensing; reimbursement arrangements and other requirements and restrictions; registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; governmental (including Medicare and Medicaid) and commercial reimbursement; data privacy and security and the sharing",

We market our products in ov er 150 countries and hav e operations in approximately 80 countries. Therefore, we are subject to risks inherent in global operations. Those risks include:\n\n- the imposition of increased or new tariffs, sanctions, export controls, quotas, trade barriers, price floors or similar restrictions on our sales or key commodities like cocoa, potential changes in U.S. trade programs and trade relations with other countries, or regulations, taxes or policies that affect our operations, sales or profitability.

          "chunk_text": "that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies. If our management fails to account for other relevant information or substitute the key business metrics they review as our business changes or if the assumptions or estimates underlying the metrics are inaccurate, their ability to accurately formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions may be compromised and our business, financial results and future growth prospects may be adversely impacted.\n\nRisks Related to the Impact of the War in Ukraine on our Business\n\n## Our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position may be adversely impacted by the continuation and consequences of the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn  2024,  Russia  accounted  for  around  9%  of  our  total  cigarette  and  heated  tobacco  unit  shipment  volume,  and  around  6%  of  our  total  net  revenues.  Ukraine accounted for around 2% of our total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume, and around 1% of our total net revenues. Historically, we also produced finished goods in Ukraine for export and manufactured products in Russia. In 2022, as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we suspended planned investments and scaled down our manufacturing operations in Russia.\n\nThe full implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine for our operations in those countries are impossible to predict at this time. The likelihood of retaliatory action by the  Russian  government  against  companies,  including  PMI,  as  a  result  of  actions  and  statements  made  in  response  to  the  Russian  invasion  or  otherwise, including the possibility of legal action against us or our employees; the deprivation of rights in, or access to, our Russian or Russia-related assets; or nationalization of foreign businesses or assets (including cash reserves held in Russia and intangible assets such as trademarks), is impossible to predict. We are continuously assessing the evolving situation in Russia, including regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. The deprivation of rights in, or access to, our Russian or Russia-related assets could also result in a material impairment and could cause the deconsolidation of our Russian business. In Ukraine, there is no way to know when and to what extent we will be able to fully normalize our operations or to what extent our workforce, facilities, inventory, and other assets will remain intact. These developments have and will continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in further impairment charges.\n\nThe conflict also continues to elevate the likelihood of supply chain disruptions, both in the region and globally, and may inhibit our ability to timely source materials and services needed to make and sell our products. For example, historically we sourced certain finished goods, production materials and components from both Russia and Ukraine, including printed materials and filters, and the invasion has, and may continue to, disrupt the availability of and impact our supply chain for these materials. These disruptions, to the extent we are unable to find alternative sources or otherwise address these supply constraints, may impact the availability and cost of our products in other markets, which would adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in impairment charges. Furthermore, the imposition of various restrictions on transactions with parties from certain jurisdictions, the ban on exports of various products, and  other  economic  and  financial  restrictions  may  adversely  affect  certain  third  parties  with  which  we  do  business  in  Russia,  such  as  customers,  suppliers, intermediaries, service providers and banks.\n\nThe broader consequences of the invasion are also impossible to predict, but could include reputational consequences, further sanctions, financial or currency restrictions,  punitive  tax   law  changes,  embargoes,  regional  instability,  and  geopolitical  shifts  as  well  as  adverse  effects  on  macroeconomic  conditions,  security conditions, currency exchange rates, and financial markets. G iven the nature of our business and global operations, such geo-political instability and uncertainty could increase the costs of our materials and operations; reduce demand for our products; have a negative impact on our supply chains, manufacturing capabilities, or  distribution  capabilities;  increase  our  ex posure  to  currency  fluctuations;  constrain  our  liquidity  or  our  ability  to  access  capital  markets;  create  staffing  or operations difficulties; or subject us to increased cyber-attacks. While we will continue to monitor this fluid situation and develop contingency plans as necessary to address any disruptions to our business operations as they develop, the extent of the conflict's effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted.\n\nThe conflict may also heighten many other risks disclosed in this Form 10-K, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Such risks could affect, without limitation, the achievement of our strategic priorities, including achievement of our smoke-free business growth targets; the availability of third-party manufacturing resources; the availability of attractive acquisition and strategic business opportunities and our ability to fully realize the benefits of these transactions; our ability to attract, motivate, and retain the best global talent; and our loss of revenue from counterfeiting and similar illicit activities.",

Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.\n\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores, clubs and eCommerce platforms around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our results of operations.\n\n## Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks\n\nOur international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.\n\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we operate retail and eCommerce businesses in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.\n\nDuring fiscal 2025, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions; legal and regulatory constraints, such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as in India; restrictive governmental actions, such as trade protection measures or nationalization; antitrust and competition law regulatory matters, such as those underway in Canada, Mexico and India (relating to our Flipkart subsidiary); local product safety and environmental laws; tax regulations; local labor laws; anti-money laundering laws and regulations; trade policies; foreign ex change or currency regulations; laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection; and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.\n\nChanging our operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade or newly imposed sanctions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and we may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. In addition, tensions between nation-state governments and conflicts of laws may lead to challenges for our operations. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response, or consumer boycotts in certain regions, could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could also adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they recur, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also ex ist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, geopolitical tensions or events, laws and regulations.\n\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or U.S. sanctions laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries. Our global policies designed to regulate such business practices and our global compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations may not be adequate to prevent the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are appropriately regulated by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could subject us to fines and penalties and adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.",

Organic sales in Latin America increased 8.0% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in Latin America in 2021 versus 2020 was due to increases in Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the bar soap and underarm protection categories. The increase in Home Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the fabric softener and liquid cleaner categories.\n\nOperating profit in Latin America increased 4% in 2021 to $1,012, while as a percentage of Net sales it decreased 90 bps to 27.6%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to a decrease in Gross profit (150 bps), partially offset by a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses (20 bps) and a decrease in Other (income) expense, net (40 bps), all as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (740 bps), which were partially offset by cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (330 bps) and higher pricing.

During the second quarter of 2018, primarily based on published estimates that indicated Argentina's threeyear cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%, we concluded that Argentina became a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes. As of July 1, 2018, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our Argentinean subsidiaries and changed their functional currency from the Argentinean peso to the U.S. dollar. On July 1, 2018, both monetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Argentinean pesos were remeasured into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, with remeasurement and other transaction gains and losses recorded in net earnings. As of December 31, 2021, our Argentinean operations had $9 million of Argentinean peso denominated net monetary assets. Our Argentinean operations contributed $401 million, or 1.4% of consolidated net revenues in 2021. We recorded a remeasurement loss of $13 million in 2021, a remeasurement loss of $9 million in 2020 and a remeasurement gain of $4 million in 2019 within selling, general and administrative expenses related to the revaluation of the Argentinean peso denominated net monetary position over these periods.\n\nBrexit . Following the separation of the United Kingdom from the European Union ('Brexit') in 2020, a new trade arrangement was reached between the U.K. and E.U. that began on January 1, 2021. The main trade provisions include the continuation of no tariffs or quotas on trade between the U.K. and E.U. subject to prescribed trade terms, including but not limited to meeting product and labeling standards for both the U.K. and E.U. Cross-border trade between the U.K. and E.U. is also subject to new customs regulations, documentation and reviews. To comply with the new requirements, we increased resources in customer service and logistics, in our factories, and on our customs support teams. We adapted our processes and systems for the new and increased number of customs transactions. We continue to closely monitor and manage our inventory levels of imported raw materials, packaging and finished goods in the U.K. We have made investments in resources, systems and processes to meet the new ongoing requirements and we work to mitigate disruptions to our local supply chain and distribution, including those related to the recent transportation labor shortage in the U.K., to reduce the impact on our input and distribution costs. Despite our efforts to control costs, we have seen inflationary cost pressures rise in our U.K. business this year, as we have also experienced in other markets. If the U.K.'s separation from, or new trade arrangements with, the E.U. negatively impact the U.K. economy or result in disagreements on trade terms, delays affecting our supply chain or distribution, disruptions to sales or collections, or further increases in inflationary cost pressures, the impact to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be material. In 2021, we generated 9.3% of our net revenues in the U.K.\n\nOther Countries . Since we sell our products in over 150 countries and have operations in approximately 80 countries, we monitor economic and currency-related risks and seek to take protective measures in response to these exposures. We continue to monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts to our `business operations, currencies and net monetary exposures. Since the global onset of COVID-19 in early 2020, most countries in which we do business experienced periods of significant economic uncertainty as well as exchange rate volatility. At this time, except for Argentina which is accounted for as a highly inflationary economy, we do not anticipate any other countries in which we operate to be at risk of becoming highly inflationary economies.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash:\n\nCash and cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. We also had restricted cash within other current assets of $7 million as of December 31, 2021 and $31 million as of December 31, 2020. Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $3,553 million as of December 31, 2021 and $3,650 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Allowances for Credit Losses:\n\nThe allowances for credit losses are recorded against our receivables. They are developed at a country and region level based on historical collection experiences, current economic condition of specific customers and the forecasted economic condition of countries using various factors such as bond default rates and consumption indexes. We write off receivables once it is determined that the receivables are no longer collectible and as allowed by local laws.",

The 23.0% includes a discrete net tax benefit of $2 million, primarily driven by a $47 million net benefit from the release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to expirations of statutes of limitations and audit settlements in several jurisdictions and a $44 million benefit from two U.S. tax returns amended to reflect new guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department, offset by $100 million net tax expense from the increase of our deferred tax liabilities resulting from enacted tax legislation (mainly in the United Kingdom).\n\nOur 2020 effective tax rate of 36.2% was high due to the $452 million net tax expense incurred in connection with the JDE Peet's transaction and four KDP share sales that occurred during 2020 (the related gains were reported as gains on equity method investments). Excluding these impacts, our effective tax rate was 22.8%, which reflects unfavorable provisions from U.S. tax reform and taxes on earnings from equity method investments (these earnings are reported separately on our consolidated statements of earnings and not within earnings before income taxes), largely offset by favorable impacts from the mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and discrete net tax benefits of $119 million. The discrete net benefits were primarily driven by the $70 million net benefit from the release of the China valuation allowance and a $50 million net benefit from the release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to expirations of statutes of limitations and audit settlements in several jurisdictions.\n\nOur 2019 effective tax rate of 0.1% was significantly impacted by the $769 million net deferred tax benefit related to Swiss tax reform in the third quarter of 2019. Excluding this impact, our 2019 effective tax rate was 22.4%, which reflects unfavorable provisions from U.S. tax reform and taxes on earnings from equity method investments (these earnings are reported separately on our consolidated statements of earnings and not within earnings before income taxes), largely offset by favorable impacts from the mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and discrete net tax benefits of $176 million. The discrete net tax benefits were primarily driven by a $128 million net benefit from the release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to expirations of statutes of limitations and audit settlements in several jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "PepsiCo highlights the evolving retail landscape, noting that e-commerce channels and hard discounters are taking significant market share away from traditional retailers, and emphasizes the need to develop digital tools for retail customers and expand its own direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities. Target does not provide evidence of a direct partnership with Amazon but instead focuses on its omnichannel strategy, including pickup and delivery services, to enhance customer convenience and compete effectively in the digital space. Walmart acknowledges Amazon as a key competitor in the e-commerce and omni-channel retail sectors and emphasizes its Everyday Low Price (EDLP) and Everyday Low Cost (EDLC) strategies, along with expanding its digital advertising and fulfillment services, to maintain a competitive edge.

In addition, our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct-to-consum er e-com m erce capabilities.\n\nThe retail industry is also im pacted by the actions and increasing power of retailers, including as a result of increased consolidation of ownership resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, particularly in North Am erica, Europe and Latin Am erica. In this changing retail landscape, retailers and buying groups have im pacted and m ay continue to im pact our ability to com pete in these jurisdictions by demanding lower prices or increased prom otional program s, rem oving our products or otherwise reducing shelf space allocated to our products and focusing on introducing and developing private-label brands.

          "chunk_text": "## Other Information\n\nCompetition. We compete with brick and mortar, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocery, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, and supercenter-type stores, membership-only warehouse clubs, gasoline stations, social commerce platforms, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness and financial services. Our ability to develop and effectively operate different formats at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position in the retail industry within the markets where we operate. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers and greater brand recognition. They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.\n\nWe compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise and selection availability, services offered to customers, the quality of the products and services we offer, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. We employ many strategies and programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These strategies include the following:\n\n- EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;\n- EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers;\n- Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery, all of which enhance convenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served; and\n- Expanding our ecosystem and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial services to provide our customers a broader set of offerings to meet expanding needs.\n\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations. Our business is seasonal to a certain extent and varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, our highest sales volume for each segment has occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.\n\nSuppliers and Supply Chain. As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S. and international suppliers from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the \"fresh\" category. Consistent with applicable laws, we offer our suppliers the opportunity to efficiently sell significant quantities of their products to us. These relationships enable us to obtain pricing that reflects the volume, certainty and cost-effectiveness these arrangements provide to such suppliers, which in turn enables us to provide low prices to our customers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customers, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs, determines, along with other supply chain logistics matters (such as containers or port access for example), in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members.\n\nIntellectual Property. We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent laws, tradesecret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.\n\nGovernment Regulation. As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions.

Mondel\u0113z does not explicitly name Walmart as a key customer but notes that it sells to a wide range of retail formats, including supercenters and club stores, which are typical Walmart channels. PepsiCo, on the other hand, explicitly states that Walmart accounts for approximately 14% of its consolidated net revenue, indicating a significant dependency on the retail giant.

Organic sales in Latin America increased 16.8% in 2024. Organic sales growth was led by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in Latin America in 2024 versus 2023 was due to increases in Oral Care, Home Care and Personal Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories. The increase in Home Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the surface cleaner and hand dish categories. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the underarm protection category.\n\nOperating profit in Latin America increased 8% in 2024 to $1,526, or 140 bps to 31.9% as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to an increase in Gross profit (220 bps), partially offset by an increase in Selling, general and administrative ex penses (100 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in G ross profit was due to higher pricing and cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (290 bps), partially offset by significantly higher raw and packaging material costs (540 bps), which included foreign exchange transaction costs. This increase in Selling, general and administrative ex penses was due to higher overhead expenses (60 bps) and increased advertising investment (50 bps).",

Higher net pricing, which included the carryov er impact of pricing actions taken in 2023 as well as the effects of input cost-driv en pricing actions taken during 2024, was reflected across  all  regions.  T he  increase  in  input  costs  was  driv en  by  higher  raw  material  costs,  partially  offset  by  lower  manufacturing  costs  driv en  by productiv ity. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher cocoa, sugar, nuts and other ingredient costs, as well as unfav orable year-ov er-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower energy, edible oils, grains, dairy and packaging costs.  Ov erall, unfav orable v olume/mix was due to v olume declines partially offset by fav orable product mix. Unfav orable v olume/mix was experienced in all regions.\n\nT otal selling, general and administrativ e expenses decreased $563 million from 2023, which was net of benefits from a number of factors noted in the table abov e, including in part, fav orable contingent consideration adjustments related to the Clif Bar acquisition and lower acquisition integration costs, lapping prior-year div estiture-related costs, the elimination of costs from the dev eloped market gum business div ested in 2023, lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position, a fav orable currency translation impact related to expenses and lapping prior-year impact from the European Commission legal matter, marginally offset by costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program and higher implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow  program.  Excluding  these  factors,  selling,  general  and  administrativ e  expenses  increased  $215  million  from  2023.

          "chunk_text": "indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Other than our G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset, our goodwill reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets have fair values that significantly ex ceed their underlying carrying values.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, we determined the fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset was less than its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax ) to reduce the carrying amount to be equivalent to the estimated fair value. As of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $12.8 billion. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria.\n\nWhile we have concluded that no triggering event has occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset is susceptible to future impairment risk. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, or market contraction from an economic recession, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a future impairment charge.\n\nThe most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates.\n\nNet sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our G illette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the G illette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rates depend on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency  exchange  rates  and  business  activities  that  impact  market  share. As  a  result,  the  residual  growth  rates  could  be  adversely  impacted  by  a  sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.\n\nThe discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.\n\nThe royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.\n\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis for the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2023, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rates to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rates, which may result in an additional impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.",

Known or expected pricing or rev enue adjustments, such as trade discounts, rebates or returns, are estimated at the time of sale. We base these estimates of expected amounts principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. Estimates that affect rev enue, such as trade incentiv es and product returns, are monitored and adjusted each period until the incentiv es or product returns are realized.\n\nKey  sales  terms,  such  as  pricing  and  quantities  ordered,  are  established  on  a  frequent  basis  such  that  most  customer  arrangements  and  related incentiv es  hav e  a  one  year  or  shorter  duration. As  such,  we  do  not  capitalize  contract  inception  costs  and  we  capitalize  product  fulfillment  costs. Deferred rev enues are not material and primarily include customer adv ance payments typically collected a few days before product deliv ery, at which time deferred rev enues are reclassified and recorded as net rev enues. We generally do not receiv e non-cash consideration for the sale of goods nor do we grant payment financing terms greater than one year.\n\n## Marketing, Advertising and Research and Development\n\nWe promote our products with marketing and advertising programs.  These programs include, but are not limited to, cooperativ e adv ertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. For interim reporting purposes, adv ertising, consumer promotion and marketing research expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of v olume, based on estimated sales v olume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheets and all marketing and adv ertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred. Adv ertising expense was $2,112 million in 2024, $2,057 million in 2023 and $1,670 million in 2022. We expense product research and dev elopment costs as incurred. Research and development expense was $400 million in 2024, $380 million in 2023 and $346 million in 2022. We record marketing and adv ertising as well as research and dev elopment expenses within selling, general and administrativ e expenses.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain a share-based compensation plan, which authorizes the granting of v arious  equity-based  incentiv es,  including  stock  options  (including stock appreciation rights), deferred stock units (DSUs) and performance share units (PSUs). Stock compensation expense is amortized to expense ov er the v esting period, generally three years.\n\nStock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our Common Stock on the grant date. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in three annual installments beginning a year from the grant date and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes Model to measure the fair v alue of stock options granted to employees. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the  options  are  expected  to  be  outstanding  and  is  based  on  historical  trends.  Expected  stock  price  v olatility  is  based  on  the  implied  and  historical volatility of the Company's stock. T he expected div idend yield is based on the Company's most recent annual div idend rate. T he risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curv e in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life.\n\nDSUs are typically granted to selected management employees on an annual basis and v est ov er three years. Div idend equiv alents are paid during the vesting period for DSUs granted prior to February 27, 2024. For DSUs granted on or after February 27, 2024, div idend equiv alents accumulated ov er the vesting period are paid after v esting. T he fair v alue of our DSUs and other stock-based awards is measured at the market price of our Common Stock on the grant date.\n\nPSUs vest based on varying performance, market and serv ice conditions. Div idend equiv alents accumulated ov er the v esting period are paid after v esting. The grant date fair v alue of PSUs is determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation model for the market-based component and the market price of our Common  Stock  on  the  grant  date  for  performance-based  components.  The  final  award  may  equal 0-200  percent  of  the  target  grant,  based  on  the achiev ement of the performance and market-based components .\n\nForfeitures are estimated on the grant date for all of our stock-based compensation awards.\n\n## Employee Benefit Plans\n\nWe provide a range of benefits to our current and retired employees including pension benefits, defined contribution plan benefits, postretirement health care  benefits  and  postemployment  primarily  sev erance-related  benefits  depending  upon  local  statutory  requirements,  employee  tenure  and  serv ice requirements as well as other factors.

      "answer": "KO's Performance Share Units (PSUs) from the 2020-2022 Annual and Emerging Stronger Awards show a weighted-average grant date fair value of $57.00 and $48.36, respectively, with nearly all units released or forfeited by 2023, suggesting a relatively short-term focus. MDLZ's PSUs are part of a broader equity compensation framework with multi-year vesting, as evidenced by the 2023 balance of 4,553,166 units and a weighted-average fair value of $62.53, indicating a longer-term retention strategy. WMT, while not disclosing specific PSU values, outlines a structured vesting schedule tied to service periods\u2014quarterly over three years starting in fiscal 2023\u2014suggesting a focus on continuous associate retention and alignment with shareholder interests. The differences in vesting timing, disclosure of fair value, and structure suggest varying philosophies: KO's appears more immediate and performance-driven, MDLZ's more long-term and balanced, and WMT's more standardized and service-oriented.",

      "question": "How do Altria (MO), PepsiCo (PEP), and Philip Morris (PM) each address regulatory restrictions on marketing their products, and what does this reveal about the varying degrees of impact such regulations have across the consumer staples sector?",
      "answer": "Altria (MO) is subject to extensive marketing restrictions under the State Settlement Agreements and the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (STMSA), including bans on outdoor advertising, free sampling (except in adult-only facilities), and prohibitions on youth-targeted marketing. These agreements also impose corporate principles aimed at reducing underage tobacco use. PepsiCo (PEP) faces marketing and labeling restrictions in certain jurisdictions due to ingredients in its products, such as sugar, sodium, or saturated fat, with some regions requiring consumer warnings or limiting marketing to specific age groups. Philip Morris (PM) is negatively impacted by global regulatory initiatives\u2014especially those stemming from the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC)\u2014that restrict advertising, mandate plain packaging, and limit point-of-sale displays, all of which significantly affect its ability to market tobacco and smoke-free products. The comparative analysis shows that while MO and PM operate under binding legal frameworks that limit marketing freedom, PEP faces more variable and emerging regulatory pressures tied to health-conscious consumer trends and ingredient transparency.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFor a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on us, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below and Note 20. The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers' business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). The State Settlement Agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters. In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; limit the industry's ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.\n\nIn November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the 'STMSA') with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC. The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions. USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.\n\n## Other International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity\n\n- International, Federal, State and Local Regulation: Various states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches), such as legislation that (i) prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories, such as e-vapor, (ii) prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors, such as menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, (iii) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings, (iv) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products and (v) requires manufacturers of e-vapor products to certify that they are in compliance with FDA requirements to be allowed to sell in the state. The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products. As of February 24, 2025, multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products, and six states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Utah) and the District of Columbia have passed such legislation. Some states, such as New York, Utah and Illinois, ex empt certain products that have received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway. The legislation in California, which became effective in December 2022, bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors, including menthol, mint and wintergreen.\n\nIndiana, Massachusetts and Utah passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in e-vapor products. As of February 24, 2025, legislation relating to this issue is pending in three other states.\n\nSimilar restrictions to those enacted or proposed in various U.S. states and localities on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products have been enacted or proposed internationally.\n\nWe have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal, state and local legislation and other governmental action, including through litigation. Certain legislation imposing restrictions on tobacco products, such as state laws requiring manufacturers of e-vapor products to certify that they are in compliance with federal law in order to sell products in the state, aligns with our V ision, and we actively engage with lawmakers in support of such legislation. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Such action also could negatively impact adult smokers' transition to smoke-free products, which could materially adversely affect our innovative tobacco businesses and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\n- Federal, State and Local Legislation to Increase the Legal Age to Purchase Tobacco Products: In December 2019, after a number of states and localities proposed and enacted legislation to increase the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products, including e-vapor products, the federal government passed legislation increasing the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products, including e-vapor products, to 21 nationwide. As of February 24, 2025, 43 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have enacted laws increasing the legal age to purchase tobacco products to 21. Although an increase in the minimum age to purchase tobacco products may have a negative impact on our operating companies' sales volumes, we support raising the minimum legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 at the federal and state levels, as discussed above under Underage Access and Use of Certain Tobacco Products , reflecting our longstanding commitment to combat underage tobacco use.\n- Health Effects of Tobacco Products, Including E -vapor Products: Reports with respect to the health effects of smoking have been publicized for many years, including various reports by the U.S. Surgeon General. We believe that the public should be guided by the messages of the U.S. Surgeon General and public health authorities worldwide in making decisions concerning the use of tobacco products, including e-vapor products. Along with the scientific and public health communities, we continue to study and gather scientific evidence concerning the health effects of e-vapor and other innovative tobacco products. It is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco ex posure and the impact of such",

Significant regulatory developments will continue to take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the \"FCTC\"). Since it came into force in 2005, the FCTC has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the marketing and sale of tobacco and nicotine-containing products to adult nicotine users. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions include:\n\n- restrictions on or licensing of outlets permitted to sell tobacco or nicotine-containing products;\n- the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;\n- restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship;\n- the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements;\n- restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors, and mandating plain packaging;\n- restrictions on packaging and cigarette formats and dimensions;\n- restrictions or bans on the display of product packaging at the point of sale and restrictions or bans on vending machines;\n- generation sales bans, under which the sale of certain tobacco or nicotine-containing products to people born after a certain year would be prohibited;\n- requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and/or other smoke or product constituents;\n- disclosure, restrictions, or bans of tobacco product ingredients, including bans on the flavors of certain tobacco and nicotine-containing products;\n- increased restrictions on smoking and use of tobacco and nicotine-containing products in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors;\n- restrictions or prohibitions of novel tobacco or nicotine-containing products or related devices;\n- elimination of duty free sales and duty free allowances for travelers;\n- restrictions in terms of importing or ex porting our products impacting our logistics activities and ability to ship our products;\n- encouraging litigation against tobacco companies; and\n- excluding tobacco companies from transparent public dialogue regarding public health and other policy matters.\n\nOur financial results could be materially affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands. More specifically, requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products or impede adult consumers' ability to convert to our SFPs, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n\n## Changes in the earnings mix and changes in tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates. Our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and div idends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls and other regulations.\n\nWe are subject to income tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the  base  erosion  and  profit  shifting  project  undertaken  by  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (the  \"OECD\"),  which  recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, and could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate thereby reducing our net earnings.

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) highlights that labor unrest is among several environmental and social risks tied to its global operations, particularly in regions affected by geopolitical instability. Mondelez (MDLZ) notes that labor unrest, especially among unionized workers (60% of its 78,000 non-U.S. employees and 20% of its 12,000 U.S. employees), could disrupt its supply chain and manufacturing processes. Target (TGT) emphasizes that labor unrest, particularly in its global administrative and sourcing hubs such as Bangalore, India, could materially impact its operations and financial condition. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies face labor-related risks, their exposure varies based on workforce structure, geographic presence, and operational dependencies.",

If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.\n\n## Business and Industry Risks\n\nWe face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nWe operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately two-thirds of our Net sales originating in markets outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we face risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:\n\n- changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of inflationary pressure, economic slowdown or recession, the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, major developments in trade relations, volatile commodity prices and increases and/or volatility in the cost of raw and packaging materials, labor, energy and logistics;\n- changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows from non-U.S. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars, in those markets;\n- political instability or uncertainty, including as a result of elections, economic instability, geopolitical events and tensions, wars and military conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East and tensions between China and Taiwan;\n- changes to trade policies and agreements and other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of and/or the increase in trade restrictions and/or tariffs, sanctions, price controls, labor laws, travel or immigration restrictions, profit controls or other government controls, including as a result of the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East and tensions between China and Taiwan;\n- environmental events, widespread health emergencies, such as pandemics or epidemics, natural disasters or social or labor unrest;\n- exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import or ex port raw materials or finished product, including as a result of the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, or to repatriate earnings from overseas;\n- lack of well-established, reliable and/or impartial legal systems in certain countries where we operate and difficulties in enforcing contractual, intellectual property or other legal rights; and\n- foreign ownership and investment restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources.\n\nAny or all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix  from higher margin to lower margin product offerings.\n\nWe face risks resulting from political and macroeconomic instability and geopolitical events and tensions, such as the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East and tensions between China and Taiwan.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe may be unable to hire or retain and develop key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce or effectively manage changes in our workforce and respond to shifts in labor availability.\n\nWe must attract, hire, retain and dev elop effectiv e leaders and a highly skilled and div erse global workforce. We compete to hire new personnel with a variety  of  capabilities  in  the  many  countries  in  which  we  manufacture  and  market  our  products  and  then  to  dev elop  and  retain  their  skills  and competencies. We have experienced and could continue to experience unplanned or increased turnov er of employees with key capabilities, and we could fail to dev elop adequate succession plans for leadership positions or hire and retain a workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business. We could also fail to attract and dev elop personnel with key emerging capabilities that we need to continue to respond to changing consumer and customer needs and grow our business, including skills in the areas of adv anced technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning, digital commerce, data analytics and supply chain expertise. Occurrence of any of these conditions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiv eness.\n\nWe are experiencing an increasingly tight and competitiv e labor market and could face unforeseen challenges in the av ailability of labor. A sustained labor  shortage  or  increased  turnov er  rates  within  our  employee  base  as  a  result  of  general  macroeconomic  factors  (including  high  inflation  and hyperinflation in certain markets), hav e led and in the future could continue to lead to increased costs, such as increased ov ertime to meet demand and increased wages to attract and retain employees. We hav e also been negativ ely affected and could continue to be negativ ely affected by labor shortages or constraints experienced by our partners, including our external manufacturing partners, freight prov iders, other strategic suppliers and distributors. Failure  to  achiev e  and  maintain  a  div erse  workforce  and  leadership  team,  compensate  our  employees  competitiv ely  and  fairly,  maintain  a  safe  and inclusiv e  env ironment or promote the well-being of our employees could affect our reputation and also result in lower performance and an inability to retain v aluable employees.\n\nWe must address changes in, and that affect, our workforce and satisfy the legal requirements associated with how we manage and compensate our employees. This includes our management of employees represented by labor unions or workers' councils, who represent approximately 60% of our 78,000 employees outside the United States and approximately 20% of our 12,000 U.S. employees. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest by our employees or those of our suppliers, distributors or other business partners, or situations like the renegotiation of collectiv e bargaining agreements,  hav e  in  the  past  and  may  in  the  future  cause  disruptions  to  our  supply  chain,  manufacturing  or  distribution  processes.  Changes  in immigration laws and policies or restrictions could make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees. We could also fail to effectiv ely respond to ev olv ing perceptions and goals of those in our workforce or whom we might seek to hire with respect to flexible working or other matters. These risks could materially and adv ersely affect our reputation, ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing facilities and ov erall business and meet the needs of our customers, product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\nWe face risks  related  to  complying  with  changes  in  and  inconsistencies  among  laws  and  regulations  in  many  countries  in  which  we operate.\n\nOur activ ities around the world are highly regulated and subject to gov ernment ov ersight. Various laws and regulations gov ern food production, sourcing, packaging and waste management (including packaging containing PFAS), storage, distribution, sales, adv ertising, labeling and marketing, as well as intellectual property, competition, antitrust, trade and export controls, labor, tax, social and env ironmental matters, priv acy, data protection, and health and  safety  practices.  Gov ernment  authorities  regularly  change  laws  and  regulations,  their  interpretations  of  existing  laws  and  regulations,  and  their enforcement priorities. Our failure to comply with existing laws and regulations (or allegations thereof), or to make changes necessary to comply with new or revised laws and regulations or ev olv ing  interpretations  and  application  of  existing  laws  and  regulations,  and  differing  or  competing  laws  and regulations  across  the  markets  where  our  products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  and  sold,  could  materially  and  adv ersely  affect  our  product sales, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including as a result of higher compliance costs, higher capital expenditures and higher production costs. For instance, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negativ ely affected by the regulatory and economic impact of changes in the corporate tax policies of the United States and other countries; tariff policies and trade relations among the United States and other  countries,  including  China,  Mexico,  Canada  and  the  European  Union;  and  changes  within  the  European  Union.  Ev olv ing  expectations  on  ESG disclosures  and  reporting  will  also  result  in  new  regulatory  actions.

If we do not effectively manage our workforce, our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWith over 400,000 team members, our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense, and our business is dependent on our ability to attract, train, and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team members, contractors, and temporary staffing. Many team members are in entry-lev el or part-time positions with high turnov er rates historically. Our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as labor  laws  and  regulations,  labor  av ailability,  unemployment  lev els,  prev ailing  wage  rates,  benefit  costs,  changing  demographics,  immigration  laws  and regulations (including through executiv e orders), and our reputation within the labor market. If we are unable to attract and retain a workforce meeting our needs (including for specialized roles with significant competition for talent) or are unable to successfully execute on succession planning at all lev els of the organization, our operations, strategy, guest serv ice lev els, support functions, and competitiv eness could suffer. Any of these outcomes could adv ersely affect  our  reputation,  results  of  operations,  and  financial  condition.  We  are  periodically  subject  to  labor  organizing  efforts  and  activ ism,  which  could negativ ely impact how we are perceiv ed by team members and our ov erall reputation. If we become subject to one or more collectiv e bargaining agreements in the future, it could adv ersely affect our labor costs, how we operate our business, and our results of operations. In addition to our U.S. operations, we perform additional administrativ e functions in Bangalore, India, and perform global sourcing operations from offices in 12 countries, predominantly in Asia and Central America, and any extended disruption of our operations in our different locations, whether due to labor difficulties or otherwise, could adv ersely affect our results of operations. In particular, we rely on our administrativ e functions in India for v arious business operations and any ev ents that negativ ely impact  the  av ailability  or  effectiv eness  of  our  administrativ e  functions  in  India,  including  political  or  economic  uncertainty  or  instability,  the  outbreak  of pandemics or other illnesses, labor shortages, labor unrest or strikes, weather conditions, natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, social unrest, terrorist attacks, and armed conflicts, could adv ersely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Failure to address product safety and sourcing concerns could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nIf  any  of  our  merchandise  offerings  do  not  meet  applicable  safety  standards  or  T arget's  or  our  guests'  expectations  regarding  safety,  supply  chain transparency, and responsible sourcing, we could be exposed to legal and reputational risks and our results of operations could be adv ersely affected. Our vendors  must  comply  with  applicable  product  safety  laws,  and  we  are  dependent  on  them  to  ensure  that  the  products  we  buy  comply  with  all  safety standards. Ev ents that giv e rise to actual or perceiv ed product safety concerns, including food or drug contamination and product defects, could expose us to gov ernment enforcement actions and priv ate litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. Our sourcing v endors, including any third parties selling through our digital channels, must also meet our expectations and comply with applicable laws and regulations across multiple areas of social  compliance,  including  supply  chain  transparency  and  responsible  sourcing.  We  hav e  a  social  compliance  audit  process  that  performs  audits regularly, but we cannot continuously monitor ev ery v endor, so we are also dependent on our v endors to ensure that the products we buy comply with applicable standards. If we need to seek alternativ e sources of supply from v endors with whom we hav e less familiarity, the risk of these standards not being met may increase. Negativ e guest perceptions regarding the safety and sourcing of the products we sell could harm our reputation and adv ersely affect our results of operations.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive highlights exposure to supply chain disruptions due to geopolitical instability, specifically citing the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war, and tensions between China and Taiwan as factors that may limit their ability to import raw materials or finished products. Coca-Cola emphasizes the risk of retaliatory tariffs and trade restrictions, noting that such measures\u2014potentially arising from political and economic instability or deteriorating international relations\u2014could significantly impact its profitability. Target focuses on the compliance obligations tied to import restrictions, indicating that failure to meet these regulatory requirements could lead to legal and reputational risks, particularly in areas like responsible sourcing and sanctions programs.

      "answer": "MDLZ reported a $1,759 million impact from commodity contracts recognized in cost of sales for 2024, indicating a significant use of these contracts to hedge input costs. PEP disclosed $57 million in losses/gains on commodity contracts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and $123 million reclassified into the income statement, showing a more moderate exposure and potential timing differences in contract settlement. PM described the valuation methodology for its commodity contracts based on market spot and futures prices but did not provide specific dollar amounts, suggesting a more qualitative approach to disclosing contract impacts. Together, these differences suggest varying strategies and levels of transparency around commodity risk management in the consumer staples sector.",

Mondel\u0113z (MDLZ) references commodity derivatives in the context of mark-to-market impacts affecting earnings, noting that unfavorable movements reduced diluted EPS in 2020 and improved it in 2021. PepsiCo (PEP) provides a detailed breakdown of its commodity derivatives, showing $70 million in assets and $5 million in liabilities designated as cash flow hedges, and $35 million in assets and $22 million in liabilities not designated as hedges as of 2022.

We manage our exposure to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements, which enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used in our manufacturing and distribution operations. When deemed appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to further manage our exposure to commodity risks. Certain of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but they are effective economic hedges that help the Company mitigate the price risk associated with the purchases and transportation of materials used in our manufacturing processes.\n\nThe total notional values of our commodity derivatives were $918 million and $726 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These values included derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting as well as economic hedges. There were no significant commodity derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as of December 31, 2021 .

Based on these Federal / Cantonal events, our position is the enactment of Swiss tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes was met as of September 30, 2019, and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter 2019. The net impact was a benefit of $767 million, which consisted of a $769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $2 million indirect tax impact in selling, general and administrative expenses. The ongoing impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes became effective January 1, 2020. See Note 16, Income Taxes , for more information.\n\n## Summary of Results\n\n- Net revenues were approximately $28.7 billion in 2021 and $26.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 8.0% in 2021 and an increase of 2.8% in 2020. In 2021, our net revenue growth continued to reflect increased demand for most of our snack category products in both our emerging and developed markets relative to 2020, though some markets were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. In developed markets, increased food purchases for in-home consumption continued to drive net revenue growth, partially offset by declines in some markets as they lapped prior-year strong volume growth resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic. In emerging markets, we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020, with strong revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets, though some markets remained challenged. In addition, our out-of-home consumption businesses, which experienced significant negative impacts from the pandemic in 2020, continued to recover, particularly our gum and candy, foodservice and world travel retail businesses.\n- -Net revenues increased in 2021, driven by favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, a significant impact from favorable currency translation, as most currencies we operate in strengthened against the U.S. dollar compared to exchange rates in the prior year, and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Gourmet Foods, Grenade and Hu in 2021 and Give &amp; Go in 2020.\n- -Net revenues increased in 2020, driven by higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of Give &amp; Go in 2020 and Perfect Snacks in 2019. These items were partially offset by the significant impact of unfavorable currency translation, as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies in which we operate compared to exchange rates in the prior year, as well as the May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa.\n- Organic Net Revenue increased 5.2% to $28.0 billion in 2021 and increased 3.7% to $26.8 billion in 2020. Organic Net Revenue increased in both 2021 and 2020 due to favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing, despite impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic described above. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures. We use Organic Net Revenue as it provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying operating results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section).\n- Diluted EPS attributable to Mondel\u0113z International increased 23.1% to $3.04 in 2021 and decreased 8.2% to $2.47 in 2020.\n- -Diluted EPS increased in 2021 primarily driven by an increase in Adjusted EPS, lapping prior-year costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, favorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lapping the prioryear loss on interest rate swaps, lower losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses, lower Simplify to Grow program costs and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. These factors were partially offset by a lower gain on equity method investment transactions, higher initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, lower net earnings from divestitures, lapping the prior-year benefit from the resolution of tax matters and higher impact from pension participation changes.\n- -Diluted EPS decreased in 2020 primarily driven by lapping the prior-year benefit from initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, costs associated with the JDE Peet's transaction, loss on debt extinguishment, unfavorable year-over year change in equity method investee items, higher intangible asset impairment charges, unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lapping a prior-year gain on divestiture and lapping the prior-year benefit from pension participation changes. These factors were partially offset by gains on equity method investment transactions, higher Adjusted EPS, favorable change from the resolution of tax matters (a benefit in 2020 as compared to an expense in 2019), lower Simplify to Grow program costs and lower losses related to interest rate swaps.",

Similarly, Target defines cash equivalents as highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and also includes amounts due from financial institutions for credit and debit card transactions.

          "chunk_text": "## Currency Translation\n\nFinancial statements of operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in Other comprehensive income (OCI). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Re-measurement adjustments for financial statements in highly inflationary economies and other transactional exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings.\n\n## Cash Flow Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method, which reconciles net earnings to cash flows from operating activities. Cash flows from foreign currency transactions and operations are translated at monthly exchange rates for each period. Cash flows from hedging activities are included in the same category as the items being hedged. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as investing activities. Realized gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative instruments used to hedge currency exposures resulting from intercompany financing transactions are classified as financing activities. Cash flows from other derivative instruments used to manage interest rates, commodity or other currency exposures are classified as operating activities. Cash payments related to income taxes are classified as operating activities.\n\n## Investments\n\nThe  Company  holds  minor  equity  investments  in  certain  companies  over  which  we  exert  significant  influence,  but  do  not  control  the  financial  and  operating decisions. These are accounted for as equity method investments. Other equity investments that are not controlled, and over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, and for which there is a readily determinable market value, are recorded at fair value, with gains and losses recorded through net earnings.  Equity  investments  without  readily  determinable  fair  values  are  measured  at  cost,  less  impairments,  plus  or  minus  observable  price  changes.  Equity investments are included as Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company also holds highly liquid investments, primarily money market funds and time deposits. Such investments are considered cash equivalents and are included within Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Product-related inventories are maintained on the first-in, first-out method. The cost of spare part inventories is maintained using the average-cost method.\n\n## Property, Plant and E quipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized over the assets' estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Machinery and equipment includes office furniture and fixtures (15-year life), computer equipment and capitalized software (3- to 5year  lives)  and  manufacturing  equipment  (3-  to 20-year  lives).  Buildings  are  depreciated  over  an  estimated  useful  life  of 40  years.  Estimated  useful  lives  are periodically reviewed and, when appropriate, changes are made prospectively. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. Our annual impairment testing of goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n\nWe have acquired brands that have been determined to have indefinite lives. We evaluate several factors to determine whether an indefinite life is appropriate, including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. In addition, when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an additional impairment assessment is performed and indefinite-lived assets may be adjusted to a determinable life.\n\nThe cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology and other intangible assets with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives. Customer relationships, brands and other non-contractual intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over periods generally ranging from 5 to 30 years. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and remaining lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted.\n\nFor additional details on goodwill and intangible assets see Note 4.\n\n## Fair Values of Financial Instruments\n\nCertain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Changes in assumptions or estimation methods could affect the fair value estimates; however, we do not believe any such changes would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, certain investments and certain short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair values of long-term debt and financial instruments are disclosed in Note 9.\n\nAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherw ise specified.",

          "chunk_text": "## Note 2.\n\n## Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nPMI  uses  the  acquisition  method  of  accounting  for  acquired  businesses. Under  the  acquisition  method,  PMI's  consolidated  financial  statements  reflect  the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing date of the acquisition. PMI allocates the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recognized in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statement of earnings. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIf  PMI determines that assets acquired do not meet the definition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than a business  combination  and,  therefore,  no  goodwill  will  be  recorded. In  an  asset  acquisition,  acquired  in-process  research  and  development  (\"IPR&amp;D\")  with  no alternative future use is charged to ex pense.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated primarily over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years, and buildings and building improvements primarily over periods up to 40 years.\n\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. For further details, see Note 5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net .\n\n## Employee benefit plans\n\nPMI provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits (primarily severance). PMI records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified under U.S. GAAP. PMI recognizes the funded status of its defined pension and postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the  benefit  obligation. PMI measures the plan assets and liabilities at the end of the fiscal year. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation. For the postretirement health care plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Any plan with an overfunded status is recognized as an asset, and any plan with an underfunded status is recognized as a liability. Any gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as a component of net periodic benefit costs are recorded as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred taxes. PMI elects to recognize actuarial gains/(losses) using the corridor approach.\n\n## Fair value measurements\n\nPMI follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. The guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The guidance describes three levels of input that may be used to measure fair value. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets  or  liabilities;  quoted  prices  in  markets  that  are  not  active;  or  other  inputs  that  are  observable  or  can  be  corroborated  by  observable  market  data  for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair  value  of  the  assets  or  liabilities. Categorization  within  the  valuation  hierarchy  is  based  upon  the  lowest  level  of  input  that  is  significant  to  the  fair  value measurement.",

Costco (COST) identifies electricity as a key energy input in its distribution and warehouse operations and highlights that increased regulation around carbon emissions could raise compliance costs and materially affect profitability. Mondelez (MDLZ) explicitly includes electricity among the energy sources used in its factories and warehouses and notes that rising commodity costs, including energy, are managed through hedging strategies, though full protection is not guaranteed.

Government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulation affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. As the economy transitions to lower  carbon  intensity  we  cannot  guarantee  that  we  will  make  adequate  investments  or  successfully  implement strategies  that  will  effectively  achieve  our  climate-related  goals,  which  could  lead  to  negative  perceptions  among members  and  other  stakeholders  and  result  in  reputational  harm.  Climate  change,  extreme  weather  conditions, wildfires, droughts and rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience.\n\nWe also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and increased regulations. More stringent fuel economy standards and public policies aimed at increasing the adoption of zero-emission and alternative fuel vehicles and other regulations related to climate change will affect our future operations and may adversely impact our profitability, and require significant capital expenditures.\n\n## Failure  to  meet  financial  market  expectations  could  adversely  affect  the  market  price  and  volatility  of  our stock.\n\nWe believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our warehouse and e-commerce comparable sales growth  rates,  membership  renewal  rates,  new  member  sign-ups,  gross  margin,  earnings,  earnings  per  share,  new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the price of our stock to decline.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2022,  we  operated  260  warehouses  outside  of  the  U.S.,  and  we  plan  to  continue  expanding  our international  operations.  Future  operating  results  internationally  could  be  negatively  affected  by  a  variety  of  factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which are beyond our control.

We continue to invest in a global network of technical centers to research and support our growth while continuing to innovate our processes. Our innovation and new product development objectives include continuous improvement in food safety and quality, growth through new products, superior consumer satisfaction and reduced production costs. Our innovation efforts focus on anticipating consumer demands and adapting quickly to changing market trends. We work to test-and-learn new ideas and implement successful ones into other areas of our business. Mindful snacking and sustainability are a significant focus of our current research and development initiatives. We work to introduce new varieties of our core products, including new taste or nutrition profiles based on consumer preferences, such as Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate bars with 30% less sugar, Sugar-free Oreos and the Cadbury Plant Bar , a vegan (100% plant-based) sustainably-sourced cocoa chocolate bar wrapped in plant-based packaging. We aim to address consumer needs and market trends and leverage scalable innovation platforms, sustainability programs and breakthrough technologies in order to delight our consumers and fuel our growth. We are focusing our technical research and development resources at 12 technical centers around the globe to drive growth, creativity, greater effectiveness, improved efficiency and accelerated project delivery.\n\nWe also have a dedicated innovation and venture hub, SnackFutures, which is designed to capitalize on consumer trends and emerging growth opportunities in well-being snacks. The group's priorities support incremental growth against three key strategic areas: invent new brands and businesses, invest in early stage entrepreneurs, and amplify SnackFutures' impact with the CoLab start-up engagement program built to provide start-ups with tools, technologies and expertise that can help them learn, grow and succeed.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe face competition in all aspects of our business. Competitors include large multinational as well as numerous local and regional companies, including new start-up brands and businesses. Some competitors have different profit objectives and investment time horizons than we do and therefore may approach pricing and promotional decisions differently. We compete based on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, service, product innovation, taste, convenience, nutritional value, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, effectiveness of digital and other sales and marketing, routes to market and distribution networks, promotional activity and price. Growing our market share or introducing a new product requires substantial research, development, advertising and promotional expenditures. We believe these investments lead to better products and stronger brands for the consumer and support our growth and market position.\n\n## Raw Materials and Packaging\n\nWe purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including cocoa, dairy, wheat, palm and other vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners, flavoring agents and nuts. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas, fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses. We monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can sustainably and cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production.\n\nA number of external factors such as changing weather patterns and conditions, commodity market conditions, effects from the current COVID-19 global pandemic, supply chain disruptions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs.\n\nDue to factors noted above, the costs of our principal raw materials can fluctuate. During late 2021 in particular, commodity costs have primarily increased due to recent supply chain disruptions. We expect commodity cost volatility to continue, and our commodity hedging activities cannot fully offset this volatility. Despite the recent and expected supply chain, transportation and labor disruptions, at this time, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available. However, we continue to monitor the nearterm and long-term impacts of the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, climate change and related factors that could affect the availability or cost of raw materials, packaging and energy.

Known or expected pricing or rev enue adjustments, such as trade discounts, rebates or returns, are estimated at the time of sale. We base these estimates of expected amounts principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. Estimates that affect rev enue, such as trade incentiv es and product returns, are monitored and adjusted each period until the incentiv es or product returns are realized.\n\nKey  sales  terms,  such  as  pricing  and  quantities  ordered,  are  established  on  a  frequent  basis  such  that  most  customer  arrangements  and  related incentiv es  hav e  a  one  year  or  shorter  duration. As  such,  we  do  not  capitalize  contract  inception  costs  and  we  capitalize  product  fulfillment  costs. Deferred rev enues are not material and primarily include customer adv ance payments typically collected a few days before product deliv ery, at which time deferred rev enues are reclassified and recorded as net rev enues. We generally do not receiv e non-cash consideration for the sale of goods nor do we grant payment financing terms greater than one year.\n\n## Marketing, Advertising and Research and Development\n\nWe promote our products with marketing and advertising programs.  These programs include, but are not limited to, cooperativ e adv ertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. For interim reporting purposes, adv ertising, consumer promotion and marketing research expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of v olume, based on estimated sales v olume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheets and all marketing and adv ertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred. Adv ertising expense was $2,112 million in 2024, $2,057 million in 2023 and $1,670 million in 2022. We expense product research and dev elopment costs as incurred. Research and development expense was $400 million in 2024, $380 million in 2023 and $346 million in 2022. We record marketing and adv ertising as well as research and dev elopment expenses within selling, general and administrativ e expenses.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain a share-based compensation plan, which authorizes the granting of v arious  equity-based  incentiv es,  including  stock  options  (including stock appreciation rights), deferred stock units (DSUs) and performance share units (PSUs). Stock compensation expense is amortized to expense ov er the v esting period, generally three years.\n\nStock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our Common Stock on the grant date. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in three annual installments beginning a year from the grant date and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes Model to measure the fair v alue of stock options granted to employees. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the  options  are  expected  to  be  outstanding  and  is  based  on  historical  trends.  Expected  stock  price  v olatility  is  based  on  the  implied  and  historical volatility of the Company's stock. T he expected div idend yield is based on the Company's most recent annual div idend rate. T he risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curv e in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life.\n\nDSUs are typically granted to selected management employees on an annual basis and v est ov er three years. Div idend equiv alents are paid during the vesting period for DSUs granted prior to February 27, 2024. For DSUs granted on or after February 27, 2024, div idend equiv alents accumulated ov er the vesting period are paid after v esting. T he fair v alue of our DSUs and other stock-based awards is measured at the market price of our Common Stock on the grant date.\n\nPSUs vest based on varying performance, market and serv ice conditions. Div idend equiv alents accumulated ov er the v esting period are paid after v esting. The grant date fair v alue of PSUs is determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation model for the market-based component and the market price of our Common  Stock  on  the  grant  date  for  performance-based  components.  The  final  award  may  equal 0-200  percent  of  the  target  grant,  based  on  the achiev ement of the performance and market-based components .\n\nForfeitures are estimated on the grant date for all of our stock-based compensation awards.\n\n## Employee Benefit Plans\n\nWe provide a range of benefits to our current and retired employees including pension benefits, defined contribution plan benefits, postretirement health care  benefits  and  postemployment  primarily  sev erance-related  benefits  depending  upon  local  statutory  requirements,  employee  tenure  and  serv ice requirements as well as other factors. The cost for these plans is recognized in earnings primarily ov er the working life of the cov ered employee.",

Business.\n\nThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (the Company) is focused on providing  branded  products  of  superior  quality  and  value  to improve  the  lives  of  the  world's  consumers,  now  and  for generations to come. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905,  having  first  been  established  as  a  New  Jersey corporation in 1890, and was built from a business founded in Cincinnati  in  1837  by  William  Procter  and  James  Gamble. Today,  our  products  are  sold  in  approximately  180  countries and territories.\n\nAdditional  information  required  by  this  item  is  incorporated herein by reference to Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A);  and  Notes  1  and  2  to  our  Consolidated  Financial Statements. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the  \"Company,\"  \"P&amp;G,\"  \"we,\"  \"our\"  or  \"us\"  as  used  herein refer to The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries.\n\nThroughout  this  Form  10-K,  we  incorporate  by  reference information  from  other  documents  filed  with  the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe  Company's  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  quarterly reports  on  Form  10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that  contains  these  reports  at: www.sec.gov. Reports can also be accessed through links from our website at: www.pginvestor.com. P&amp;G  includes the website  link  solely  as  a  textual  reference.  The  information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report.\n\nCopies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting EQ  Shareowner  Services, 1100  Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota, MN 55120-4100.\n\n## Financial Information about Segments\n\nInformation about our reportable segments can be found in the MD&amp;A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Narrative Description of Business\n\nBusiness Model .  Our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing brands and products, as well as the  creation  of  new  innovative  products  and  brands.  The markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly competitive. Our products are sold in approximately 180  countries  and  territories  through  numerous  channels  as well  as  direct-to-consumer.  Our  growth  strategy  is  to  deliver meaningful and noticeable superiority across five key vectors of our consumer proposition -product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and consumer  and  customer  value.  We  use  our  research  and development (R&amp;D) and consumer insights to provide superior products and packaging. We utilize our marketing and online  presence  to  deliver  superior  brand  messaging  to  our consumers.  We  work  collaboratively  with  our  customers  to deliver  superior  retail  execution,  both  in-store  and  online.  In conjunction with the above vectors, we provide superior value to consumers and our retail customers in each price tier in which we  compete.  Productivity  improvement  is  also  critical  to delivering  our  objectives  of  balanced  top  and  bottom-line growth and value creation.\n\nKey Product Categories . Information on key product categories  can  be  found  in  the  MD&amp;A  and  Note  2  to  our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nKey Customers .  Our customers include mass merchandisers, e-commerce  (including  social  commerce)  channels,  grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors,  wholesalers,  specialty  beauty  stores  (including airport  duty-free  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies, electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell direct  to  consumers.  Sales  to  Walmart  Inc.  and  its  affiliates represent approximately 15% of our total sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020. No other customer represents more than 10% of our total sales. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 39% of our total sales in 2022, 39% in 2021 and 38% in 2020.\n\nSources and Availability of Materials . Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from third parties, some of whom are single-source suppliers. We  produce  certain  raw  materials,  primarily  chemicals,  for further  use  in  the  manufacturing  process.  In  addition,  fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing processes and in the transportation  of  input  materials  and  finished  products.  The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may  not  pass  the  change  to  our  customers.  The  Company purchases  a  substantial  variety  of  other  raw  and  packaging materials, none of which are material to our business taken as a whole.\n\nTrademarks  and  Patents .  We  own  or  have  licenses  under patents and registered trademarks, which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Some of these patents  or  licenses  cover  significant  product  formulation  and processes  used  to  manufacture  our  products.  The  trademarks are  important  to  the  overall  marketing  and  branding  of  our products. All major trademarks in each business are registered. In  part,  our  success  can  be  attributed  to  the  existence  and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses.\n\nCompetitive Condition .  The  markets  in  which  our  products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known  global  competitors.  In  many  of  the  markets  and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against  other  branded  products  as  well  as  retailers'  privatelabel brands. We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant  market  share  position.  We  support  our  products with advertising, promotions and other marketing vehicles to build awareness",

      "answer": "COST highlights exposure to international risks including foreign trade policies, tariffs, and instability in regions where it operates, noting that these factors could significantly affect its financial condition. PG emphasizes the negative impact of macroeconomic conditions, particularly foreign currency fluctuations and geopolitical instability in emerging markets like Nigeria and Turkey, which could reduce sales and increase costs. WMT points to vulnerabilities in global sourcing due to political and economic instability in supplier countries, as well as the impact of climate-related disruptions on macroeconomic conditions and consumer spending. Together, these companies show a shared concern over economic instability but differ in how they articulate exposure to currency, supply chain, and geopolitical risks.",

Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions), monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights.\n\n## Changes  in  accounting  standards  and  subjective  assumptions,  estimates  and  judgments  by  management related  to  complex  accounting  matters  could  significantly  affect  our  financial  condition  and  results  of operations.\n\nAccounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including self-insurance liabilities, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying  assumptions,  estimates  or  judgments  by  our  management  could  significantly  change  our  reported  or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## We are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\nSection  404  of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act  of  2002  requires  management  assessments  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.\n\n## Changes in tax rates, new U.S. or foreign tax legislation, and exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally,  at  any  point  in  time,  we  may  be  under  examination  for  value  added,  sales-based,  payroll, product,  import  or  other  non-income  taxes.  We  may  recognize  additional  tax  expense,  be  subject  to  additional  tax liabilities,  or  incur  losses  and  penalties,  due  to  changes  in  laws,  regulations,  administrative  practices,  principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries,  a  change  in  earnings  attributable  to  the  various  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate  could  result  in  an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Significant  changes  in  or  failure  to  comply  with  regulations  relating  to  the  use,  storage,  discharge  and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are  subject  to  a  wide  and  increasingly  broad  array  of  federal,  state,  regional,  local  and  international  laws  and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes  and  other  environmental  matters.  Failure  to  comply  with  these  laws  could  result  in  harm  to  our  members, employees or others, significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or  the  imposition  of  severe  penalties  or  restrictions  on  operations  by  governmental  agencies  or  courts  that  could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",

          "chunk_text": "Additional  detailed  information  on  our  sustainability  efforts including our TCFD (Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures), SASB  (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board)  and  CDP  (Carbon  Disclosure  Project)  reports  can  be found on our website at https://pginvestor.com/esg. References to our sustainability reports and website are for informational purposes  only  and  neither  the  sustainability  reports  nor  the other information on our website is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nWe  discuss  our  expectations  regarding  future  performance, events  and  outcomes,  such  as  our  business  outlook  and objectives in this Form 10-K, as well as in our quarterly and annual reports, current reports on Form 8-K, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for  historical  and  present  factual  information,  are  'forwardlooking  statements'  and  are  based  on  financial  data  and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. We assume no  obligation  to  update  any  forward-looking  statements  as  a result  of  new  information,  future  events  or  other  factors, except to the extent required by law. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize  that events could  significantly differ  from  our expectations.\n\nThe following discussion of 'risk factors' identifies significant factors  that  may  adversely  affect  our  business,  operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and  Analysis and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes incorporated in this report. The following  discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider  when  evaluating  our  expectations.  These  and  other factors  could  cause  our  future  results  to  differ  from  those  in the  forward-looking  statements  and  from  historical  trends, perhaps materially.\n\n## MACROECONOMIC  CONDITIONS  AND  RELATED FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nOur  business  is  subject  to  numerous  risks  as  a  result  of having  significant  operations  and  sales  in  international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility.\n\nWe are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries  and  products  sold  in  approximately  180  countries and territories around the world.  We  hold assets, incur liabilities,  generate  sales  and  pay  expenses  in  a  variety  of currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar,  and  our  operations outside the U.S. generate more than fifty percent of our annual net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have  and  could  continue  to  reduce  the  U.S.  dollar  value  of sales,  earnings  and  cash  flows  we  receive  from  non-U.S. markets,  increase  our  supply  costs  (as  measured  in  U.S. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition. Further, we have  a significant  amount  of  foreign  currency  debt  and derivatives  as part of  our  capital  markets  activities.  The maturity cash outflows of these instruments could be adversely impacted by significant appreciation of foreign currency exchange rates (particularly the Euro), which could adversely impact  our  overall  cash  flows.  Moreover,  discriminatory  or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries, including  changes  to  tariffs  and  existing  trade  policies  and agreements,  could  adversely  affect  our  results.  See  also  the Results of Operations and Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity sections of the MD&amp;A  and  the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.\n\nWe  also  have  businesses  and  maintain  local  currency  cash balances  in  a  number  of  countries  with  currency  exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls or restrictions, such as Nigeria, Turkey, Argentina and Egypt. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could  be adversely  impacted  if  we  are  unable  to  successfully  manage such controls and restrictions, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased  tariffs,  quotas,  exchange  or  price  controls,  trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business.\n\nAdditionally, our business, operations or employees have been and could continue to be adversely affected (including by the need  to  de-consolidate  or  even  exit  certain  businesses  in particular countries) by political volatility, labor market disruptions  or  other  crises  or  vulnerabilities  in  individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval or acts of war (such as the Russia-Ukraine War) and the related government and other entity responses, broad  economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration  in  the  creditworthiness  of  local  governments, particularly in emerging markets.\n\nUncertain  economic  or  social  conditions  may  adversely impact  demand  for  our  products  or  cause  our  customers and  other  business  partners  to  suffer  financial  hardship, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand  for  our  products  related  to  one  or  more  significant local, regional or global economic or social disruptions. These disruptions  have  included  and  may  in  the  future  include:  a slow-down, recession or inflationary pressures in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for  our  suppliers,  vendors  or  customers;  a  significant  shift  in government policies; significant social unrest; the deterioration of economic  relations between  countries or regions, including potential negative consumer sentiment toward  non-local  products  or  sources;  or  the  inability  to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries  to  pay  funds  to  or  collect  funds  from  our customers,  vendors  and  suppliers.  Additionally,  these  and other economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third-party partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services  we  need,  in  which  case  our  business  and  results  of operations could be adversely affected.",

          "chunk_text": "or economic sanctions, increased transportation costs (whether due to fuel prices, fuel supply, or otherwise), the disruption (whether directly or indirectly) of critical infrastructure systems, banking systems, utility services or energy availability to our stores, clubs and our facilities, and the disruption in our communications with our stores, clubs and our other facilities.\n\nFurthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions, drought, or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. Certain impacts of physical risk may include: temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at stores, clubs, and distribution or fulfillment centers; extreme weather patterns that affect the production or sourcing of certain commodities; flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory; and heat and extreme weather events that cause long-term disruption or threats to the habitability of the communities in which Walmart operates. Relative to transition risk, certain impacts may include: changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate-related weather events; prolonged climate-related events affecting macroeconomic conditions with related effects on consumer spending and confidence; stakeholder perception of our engagement in climate-related policies; and new regulatory requirements resulting in higher compliance risk and operational costs.\n\nWe bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\n## Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner and in the large volumes we may demand, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.\n\nPolitical and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries and entities, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nIf the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance. We are also subject to reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms.\n\nOur customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. Whether laws related to these marketplace transactions apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes could expose us to loss of sales, reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen, or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law or the proprietary rights of others. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommerce growth and flywheel strategy.",

      "answer": "COST held $529 million in government and agency securities as part of its $561 million total investment in 2022, indicating a conservative and highly liquid approach. MO had $1,147 million invested in U.S. government and agency securities, reflecting a larger but still low-risk allocation within its broader $7.287 billion portfolio. PEP reported $2,523 million in U.S. government securities and $1,053 million in international government securities, showing a more diversified but still risk-averse stance across both domestic and foreign markets. Collectively, these allocations suggest a shared emphasis on capital preservation and liquidity, with varying degrees of scale and geographic diversification.",

We market our products in ov er 150 countries and hav e operations in approximately 80 countries. Therefore, we are subject to risks inherent in global operations. Those risks include:\n\n- the imposition of increased or new tariffs, sanctions, export controls, quotas, trade barriers, price floors or similar restrictions on our sales or key commodities like cocoa, potential changes in U.S. trade programs and trade relations with other countries, or regulations, taxes or policies that affect our operations, sales or profitability. Also see ' We are subject to risks from changes to the trade policies and tariff and import/export regulations by the U.S. and/or other foreign government s';\n- changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of inflation (and related monetary policy actions by gov ernments in response to inflation), v olatile commodity prices, the ongoing longer-term impact of changes in international trade policies (including Brexit) and increases in the cost of raw and packaging materials, labor, energy and transportation;\n- compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, including anti-bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ('FCPA');\n- compliance with antitrust and competition laws, trade laws, data priv acy laws, anti-bribery laws, human rights laws, new regulations intended to address increasing global concerns around forced labor, and a v ariety of other local, national and multinational regulations and laws in multiple regimes;\n- currency dev aluations or fluctuations in currency v alues, including in dev eloped and emerging markets. T his includes ev ents like applying highly inflationary accounting as we did for our Argentinean subsidiaries beginning in the third quarter of 2018, T \u00fcrkiye beginning in the second quarter of 2022 and both Egypt and Nigeria beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024;\n- changes in capital  controls,  including  currency  exchange  controls,  gov ernment  currency  policies  or  other  limits  on  our  ability  to  import  raw materials or finished products into v arious countries or repatriate cash from outside the United States;\n- increased  sov ereign  risk,  such  as  defaults  by  or  deterioration  in  the  economies  and  credit  ratings  of  gov ernments,  particularly  in  emerging markets;\n- changes  or  inconsistencies  in  local  regulations  and  laws,  the  uncertainty  of  enforcement  of  remedies  in  non-U.S.  jurisdictions,  and  foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources;\n- varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights;\n- discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies;\n- greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; and\n- design, implementation and use of effectiv e control env ironment processes across our div erse operations and employee base.\n\nIn addition, increased political and economic changes or v olatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activ ity, political unrest, civ il strife, acts of war , government shutdowns, product boycotts, trav el or immigration restrictions, tariffs and other trade restrictions, public health risks or pandemics, energy policy  or  restrictions,  public  corruption,  expropriation  and  other  economic  or  political  uncertainties,  including  inaccuracies  in  our  assumptions  about these factors, could interrupt and negativ ely affect our business operations or customer demand. For example, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East could impact demand for our products or result in increased supply chain costs or other cost impacts. High unemployment or the slowdown in economic growth in some markets could constrain consumer spending. Declining consumer purchasing power could result in loss of market share and adv ersely impact our profitability. The nature and degree of the v arious risks we face can also differ significantly among our regions and businesses.\n\nAll of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased rev enues and could materially and adv ersely affect our product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, stock price, and our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees in the short- or long-term.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  ris ks   from  changes   to  the  trade  policies   and  tariff  and  import/export  regulations   by  the  U.S.  and/or  other  foreign governments.\n\nChanges in the import and export policies, including trade restrictions, new or increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, sanctions and countersanctions, safeguards or customs restrictions by the U.S. and/or other foreign",

Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\n\nWe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. Our net sales and gross profit margin are influenced in part by our pricing and merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food categories; and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating purchasing in certain categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may continue to impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales.\n\nWe expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to inflationary trends; tariffs and trade restrictions; fluctuations in global currencies; swings in macroeconomic conditions and their effect on consumer confidence; volatility in employment trends; and supply chain pressures, any of which may impact our results. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to \"Results of Operations\" below.\n\n## Company Performance Metrics\n\nWe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial priorities as follows:\n\n- Growth - serve customers through a seamless omni-channel experience;\n- Margin - improve our operating income margin through productivity initiatives as well as category and business mix; and\n- Returns - improve our Return on Investment through margin improvement and disciplined capital spend.\n\n## Growth\n\nOur objective of prioritizing growth means we will focus on serving customers and members however they want to shop through our omni-channel business model. This includes increasing comparable store and club sales through increasing membership at Sam's Club U.S. and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives that complement our strategy.\n\nComparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. We report on comparable sales in the U.S. as we believe it is a meaningful metric within the context of the U.S. retail market where there is a single currency, one inflationary market and generally consistent store and club formats from year to year.\n\nCalendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2025 and 2024, were as follows:\n\n",

PepsiCo (PEP) reports no material charges related to new productivity initiatives beyond its existing 2019 Productivity Plan, indicating a more stable or mature phase in its efficiency efforts. Together, this highlights CL\u2019s proactive use of productivity as part of a broader risk management strategy, KO\u2019s skepticism about its effectiveness in the current inflationary environment, and PEP\u2019s focus on sustaining prior initiatives rather than launching new ones.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) highlights the risk that unfavorable global economic conditions, such as inflation or reduced category growth, could lead consumers to switch to private label or lower-priced brands, thereby reducing demand for its products. Costco (COST) emphasizes its reliance on identifying and responding to consumer trends to maintain member loyalty and market share, particularly regarding environmental, social, and governance (ESG) preferences. Philip Morris (PM) focuses on anticipating adult consumer trends and transitioning smokers to reduced-risk products (RRPs), noting that economic uncertainty may drive consumers toward lower-priced tobacco brands, negatively impacting premium brand volumes. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies recognize the critical role of consumer trends, they differ in scope and emphasis: CL focuses on macroeconomic pressures, COST on ESG and member-driven trends, and PM on product transition and consumer health trends.",

          "chunk_text": "unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the cost of responding to such a claim, including management time and out-ofpocket expenses, and the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation, brand image and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For information regarding our legal and regulatory matters, see Item 3 'Legal Proceedings' and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Legal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our business.\n\nAs a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories, we are and may continue to be subject to a wide variety of legal claims and proceedings, including disputes relating to intellectual property, contracts, product liability, marketing, advertising, foreign exchange controls, antitrust and trade regulation, as well as labor and employment, pension, data privacy and security, environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions. Regardless of their merit, these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend. Since litigation is inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection therewith, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. In addition, if one of our products, or an ingredient contained in our products, is perceived or found to be defective, or unsafe or have a quality issue, we have had to and may in the future need to withdraw, recall or reformulate some of our products. Whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful, or a withdrawal, recall or reformulation is required or advisable, such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image. The resolution of, or increase in the reserves taken in connection with, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for that period. See Item 3 'Legal Proceedings' and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedings.\n\n## Financial and Economic Risks\n\n## Uncertain or unfavorable global economic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19, may adversely affect our business.\n\nUncertain or unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business. Unfavorable global economic conditions, such as a recession, an economic slowdown, inflation and/or reduced category growth rates, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively impact our business and result in declining revenues, profitability and cash flows. Although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points, during periods of economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions, consumers may reduce consumption or discretionary spending and/or change their purchasing patterns by foregoing purchasing certain of our products or by switching to 'private label' or lower-priced brands. These changes could reduce demand for and sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. Additionally, our retailers may be impacted and they may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lower-priced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins. Furthermore, economic conditions can cause our suppliers, distributors, contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other third-party partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties, which may impact their inability to provide us with or distribute finished product, raw and packaging materials and/or services in a timely manner or at all. In addition, we could face difficulty collecting or recovering accounts receivables from third parties facing financial or operational difficulties.\n\n## Disruptions in the credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may adversely affect our business.\n\nWhile we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, a disruption in the credit markets, interest rate increases, changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates that are expected to replace the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or changes to our credit ratings could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding. Reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. In addition, if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper programs or other financing arrangements, such as interest rate, foreign exchange or commodity hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us.

The  extent  to  which  we  achieve  growth  in  our membership  base,  increase  the  penetration  of  Executive  membership,  and  sustain  high  renewal  rates  materially influences  our  profitability.  Damage  to  our  brands  or  reputation  may  negatively  impact  comparable  sales,  diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations.\n\nWe sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and  availability  of  these  products  is  essential  to  developing  and  maintaining  member  loyalty.  These  products  also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.\n\n## Disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction.\n\nWe  depend  on  the  orderly  operation  of  the  merchandise  receiving  and  distribution  process,  primarily  through  our depots. We also rely upon processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items. Although we believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due  to  fires,  tornadoes,  hurricanes,  earthquakes,  pandemics  or  other  extreme  weather  conditions  or  catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members. Our e-commerce operations depend  heavily  on  third-party  and  in-house  logistics  providers  and  is  negatively  affected  when  these  providers  are unable to provide services in a timely fashion.\n\n## We  may  not  timely  identify  or  effectively  respond  to  consumer  trends,  which  could  negatively  affect  our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.\n\nIt  is  difficult  to  consistently  and  successfully  predict  the  products  and  services  that  our  members  will  desire.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to environmental, social and governance practices) and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns, or we may experience out-of-stock positions and delivery delays, which could result in higher costs, both of which would reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income.\n\n## Availability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital to our business. Failure to successfully execute IT projects and have IT systems available to our business would adversely impact our operations.\n\nIT systems play a crucial role in conducting our business. These systems are utilized to process a very high volume of transactions,  conduct  payment  transactions,  track  and  value  our  inventory  and  produce  reports  critical  for  making business decisions. Failure or disruption of these systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to buy products and services from our suppliers, produce goods in our manufacturing plants, move the products in an efficient manner to  our  warehouses  and  sell  products  to  our  members.  We  are  undertaking  large  technology  and  IT  transformation projects. The failure of these",

Walmart (WMT) acknowledged that the pandemic continued to create unpredictability, with workforce availability challenges potentially impacting store operations and inventory management, and noted that future economic uncertainty, including labor availability and cost, could disrupt its operations and financial performance.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ndespite some temporary volatility in commercial paper markets in 2020, Altria has not experienced a material adverse impact to its liquidity.\n\nAs with so many other companies throughout the United States and globally, Altria's operations have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, Altria believes its tobacco businesses have not experienced any material adverse effects associated with governmental actions to restrict consumer movement or business operations, but continues to monitor these factors. Altria continues to operate in a remote working environment for many employees and believes that remote working due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had minimal impact on productivity. Also, Altria's critical information technology systems have remained operational. Although Altria's tobacco businesses previously suspended operations temporarily at several of their manufacturing facilities in March 2020, the businesses resumed operations at those facilities under enhanced safety protocols in April 2020, and all manufacturing and nonmanufacturing facilities are currently operational under enhanced safety protocols recommended by public health authorities. Altria continues to monitor the risks associated with facility disruptions and workforce availability as a result of uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and guidance from public health officials as it evolves its safety protocols.\n\nAltria also continues to monitor the inflationary environment arising in part from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on Altria's financial position and results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2021, inflation did not have a material impact on Altria's MSA expense or on direct materials and other costs. While Altria anticipates that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022, it does not believe the impacts will be material to Altria's financial position and results of operations. See Operating Results by Business Segment - Tobacco Space - State Settlement Agreements below for further discussion on MSA expense.\n\nAltria's suppliers and those within its distribution chain continue to be subject to potential facility closures, remote working protocols, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and inflation. To date, Altria has not experienced any material disruptions to its supply chains or distribution systems. Altria continues to monitor the risk that the business of one or more suppliers, distributors or any other entities within its supply and distribution chains may be disrupted.\n\nAltria believes that the COVID-19 pandemic altered adult tobacco consumer behaviors and purchasing patterns, particularly in the earlier stages of the pandemic. While the number of adult tobacco consumer trips to the store remain below pre-pandemic levels and tobacco expenditures per trip remain elevated, the environment continues to evolve as the effects of government stimulus have lessened and consumer mobility returns to more normal levels. Although Altria's tobacco businesses have not experienced a material adverse impact to date by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is continued uncertainty as to how the COVID-19 pandemic (including changes in COVID-19-related restrictions and guidelines and new variants) may impact adult tobacco consumers in the future. Altria continues to monitor the macroeconomic risks of the COVID-19 pandemic (including risks associated with the timing and extent of vaccine administration and the impact of COVID-19 variants), and their effect on adult tobacco consumers, including stay-at-home practices and disposable income, which may be further impacted by unemployment rates and inflation. Altria also continues to monitor adult tobacco consumers' purchasing behaviors, including overall tobacco product expenditures, mix between premium and discount brand purchases and adoption of smoke-free products. See Operating Results by Business Segment - Tobacco Space Business Environment Summary below for further discussion of economic conditions and the impact on adult tobacco consumer purchasing behavior.\n\nDuring 2021, ABI continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effects of COVID-19 variants, supply-chain constraints across certain markets, adverse transactional foreign exchange rates, inflation and commodity cost headwinds. While Altria considers the impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic that have negatively impacted ABI's global business to be transitory, Altria will continue to monitor its investment in ABI, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ABI's business and market valuation. See Note 6 for further discussion of Altria's investment in ABI, including the recording of a $6.2 billion non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge in 2021.\n\nAltria considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business of JUUL, including its sales, distribution, operations, supply chain and liquidity, in conducting its periodic impairment assessment and quantitative valuations. JUUL's operations were negatively impacted in 2020 and 2021 by the COVID-19 pandemic due to stay-at-home practices and government-mandated restrictions. While the impact was considered in Altria's quantitative valuations conducted in connection with the preparation of its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Altria does not believe the COVID-19 pandemic was a primary driver of the noncash, pre-tax impairment charge recorded during 2020 or any quarterly changes in fair value recorded since the fourth quarter of 2020. Altria will continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on JUUL's business, including near-term supply chain constraints, component part shortages and inflation, in Altria's quarterly quantitative valuations of JUUL. See Note 6 for further discussion of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\nAltria considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business of Cronos, including its sales, distribution, operations, supply chain and liquidity. During 2020 and 2021, Cronos was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, due in part to government actions limiting access to retail stores in the United States and Canada. Altria will continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Cronos's business, including as a result of new variants, near-term supply chain challenges, inflation and market valuation. See Note 6 for further discussion of Altria's investment in Cronos.",

Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially, or  fully  reopen  in  certain  of  these  jurisdictions  and  markets,  the  ongoing  economic  impacts  and  health concerns  associated  with  the  pandemic  may  continue  to  affect  consumer  behavior,  spending  levels  and shopping  and  consumption  preferences.  Changes  in  consumer  purchasing  and  consumption  patterns  may increase  demand  for  our  products  in  one  quarter,  resulting  in  decreased  demand  for  our  products  in subsequent quarters, or in a lower-margin sales channel resulting in potentially reduced profit from sales of our products. We continue to see shifts in product and channel preferences as markets move through varying stages  of  restrictions  and  re-opening  at  different  times,  including  changes  in  at-home  consumption,  in immediate  consumption  and  away-from-home  channels,  such  as  convenience  and  gas  and  foodservice.  In addition, we continue to see an increase in demand in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels and any failure to capitalize on this demand could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow sales or category share and erode our competitive position.\n\nAny reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty (including supply chain disruptions and labor shortages), can adversely affect our customers' and business partners' financial condition, which can result in bankruptcy filings and/or an  inability  to  pay  for  our  products,  reduced  or  canceled  orders  of  our  products,  continued  or  additional closing  of  restaurants,  stores,  entertainment  or  sports  complexes,  schools  or  other  venues  in  which  our products are sold, or reduced capacity at any of the foregoing, or our business partners' inability to supply us with ingredients or other items necessary for us to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Such adverse  changes  in  our  customers'  or  business  partners'  financial  condition  have  also  resulted  and  may continue  to  result  in  our  recording  additional  charges  for  our  inability  to  recover  or  collect  any  accounts receivable,  owned  or  leased  assets,  including  certain  foodservice  and  vending  and  other  equipment,  or prepaid expenses. In addition, continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted  in  volatility  in  the  global  capital  and  credit  markets  which  can  impair  our  ability  to  access  these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all.\n\nWhile  we  have  developed  and  implemented  and  continue  to  develop  and  implement  health  and  safety protocols,  business  continuity  plans  and  crisis  management  protocols  in  an  effort  to  mitigate  the  negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and our business, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the emergence and spread of new variants of the virus, including the omicron and delta variants, the  development  and  availability  of  effective  treatments  and  vaccines,  the  speed  at  which  vaccines  are administered, the efficacy of vaccines against the virus and evolving strains or variants of the virus, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been",

Recent years have demonstrated the widespread and varying impacts of the pandemic on certain business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, access to inventory, supply chain operations, the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus (such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business and government shutdowns, and other restrictions on retailers), our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things.\n\nCustomer behaviors have changed rapidly during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event of a resurgence of infections or future mutations, variants or related strains of the virus become prevalent, customer demand for certain products may fluctuate and customer behaviors may change, which may challenge our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. These factors may result in higher out-of-stock positions in certain products, as well as delays in delivering those products, and could impact inventory levels in the future.\n\nOther factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there are additional outbreaks or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we and our suppliers operate; further increased operational costs associated with operating during a global pandemic; evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time, capital and other resources to the pandemic response; the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and medical treatments for COVID-19 or other variants; the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides; and the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors. These risks and their impacts are difficult to predict and could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and our financial performance.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased revenue growth relative to historic trends, and has particularly accelerated our eCommerce growth. These results, as well as those of other metrics such as net income and other financial and operating data, may not be indicative of results for future periods. Once the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, particularly as vaccines become more widely available, and customers return to work or school or are otherwise no longer subject to the aforementioned containment directives and similar mandates, a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities may result in declining revenue and future operating results may fall below expectations.\n\nTo the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S. and the global economy, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, our reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Natural disasters, climate change, geopolitical events, global health epidemics or pandemics and catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons; weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; geopolitical events; global health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and catastrophic events, such as war, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in our U.S. stores), in countries in which we operate, in which our suppliers are located, or in other areas of the world (such as in Ukraine where armed hostilities currently exist between Ukraine and Russia) could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\n\nSuch events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution and fulfillment centers are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings, travel and movement limitations or otherwise) and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, increases in the costs of procuring products as a result of either reduced availability",

Inflation pressures sometimes result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results depend, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations and to anticipate consumer reaction to our management of these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.\n\nThe consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry into certain categories and growth in hard discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to  successfully  manage  relationships  with  our  retail  trade  customers,  which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers, private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if the Company or one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients, negative perceptions of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleum-based materials), lack of recyclability  or  other  environmental  attributes,  concerns  about  actual  or  alleged  labor  or  equality  and  inclusion  practices,  privacy  failures  or  data  breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted, and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer. Our Company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental sustainability.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Overview\n\nThis discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 (\"fiscal 2025\"), January 31, 2024 (\"fiscal 2024\") and January 31, 2023 (\"fiscal 2023\"), should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.\n\nThroughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.  Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.\n\nManagement also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our ecosystem, such as our advertising net sales. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than 5%. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as \"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nIn discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency ex change rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency ex change rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency ex change rates have impacted and may continue to impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment.\n\nWe have taken certain strategic actions across our segments, including an increased emphasis on investments in automation and supply chain as well as diversifying our earnings streams through category and business mix. In December 2024, the Walmart U.S. segment completed the acquisition of VIZIO Holding Corp. for net cash consideration of $1.9 billion. Additionally, we have taken actions in the Walmart International segment to reshape our portfolio including the following highlights over the last three years:\n\n- In November 2022, we completed the buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary (Refer to Note 3) and in December 2022, we exited operations in certain countries in Africa.\n- In December 2022, we increased our ownership in PhonePe as part of the separation from our majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary. Refer to Note 3.\n- In August 2024, we sold our equity investment in JD.com for net proceeds of $3.6 billion. Refer to Note 8.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce, health and wellness, financial services, advertising and data service businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality associates. We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics and pandemics, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, disruptions in supply chain, inventory management, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, inflation, deflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic",

We  work  to  test  and  learn  new  ideas  and implement successful ones into other areas of our business. T o driv e growth, creativ ity, greater effectiv eness, improv ed efficiency and accelerated project deliv ery, we are focusing our technical research and dev elopment resources at technical centers around the globe.\n\nMindful snacking and sustainability are a significant focus of our current research and dev elopment initiativ es. We work to introduce new v arieties of our core products, including new taste or nutrition profiles that cater to ev olv ing consumer preferences, such as the launch in the UK of Cadbury Dairy Milk &amp; MORE , a multi-dimensional tablet designed to deliv er a richer, more indulgent eating experience, zero-sugar Oreo's in China and reduced sugar candies under The  Natural  Confectionary  Company brand  in Australia.  We  continue  to  expand  our  portfolio  of  cakes  and  pastries  in  new  markets  and  with updated formats including Milka brownies a nd Oreo cakes .\n\nWe  also  hav e  a  dedicated  innov ation  and  v enture  hub,  SnackFutures,  specifically  tailored  to  lev erage  emerging  consumer  trends  and  growth opportunities in mindful snacking. T he core objectiv es of this group are aligned with three key strategic areas: inv ent new brands and businesses, inv est in early-stage entrepreneurs and amplify SnackFutures' influence through the CoLab start-up engagement and mentoring programs built to equip startups with essential tools, technologies and expertise that can help them learn, grow and succeed.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe operate in highly competitiv e markets that are comprised of global, regional and local competitors, including new start-up brands and businesses. Some competitors have different profit objectiv es and inv estment time horizons than we do and therefore may approach pricing and promotional decisions differently.  We compete based on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, serv ice, product innov ation, taste, conv enience, nutritional v alue, the ability  to  identify  and  satisfy  consumer  preferences,  effectiv eness  of  our  digital  and  other  sales  and  marketing  strategies,  routes  to  market  and distribution  networks,  promotional  activ ities  and  price.  Our  adv antaged  global  footprint,  operating  scale  and  portfolio  of  brands  hav e  all  significantly contributed to building our market-leading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell.

Tradem arks rem ain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our tradem arks. W e have authorized, through licensing arrangem ents, the use of m any of our tradem arks in such contexts as convenient food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointm ents. In addition, we license the use of our tradem arks on m erchandise that i s sol d at retai l , whi ch enhances brand awareness.\n\nWe either own or have licenses to use a num ber of patents which relate to certain of  our  products,  their  packaging,  the  processes  for  their production and the design and operation of various equipm ent used in our businesses. Som e of these patents are licensed to others.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur businesses are affected by seasonal variations.  Our beverage and convenient food sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter.  However, taken as a whole, seasonality has not had a m aterial i m pact on our consolidated financial results.\n\n## Our Customers\n\nOur customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice custom ers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, m ass m erchandisers, m em bership stores, hard discounters, e-com m erce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, am ong others. W e normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and m anufacture certain beverage products bearing our tradem arks within a specific geographic area. These arrangem ents provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the m anufacturing process required for product quality . W e also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our tradem arks for specified geographic areas.\n\nWe rely on and provide financial incentives to our custom ers to assist in the distribution and prom otion of our products to the consum er. For our i n dependent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volum e-based rebates, product placem ent fees, prom otions and displays. For our i n dependent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipm ent placem ent. Consumer  incentives  include  pricing  discounts  and  prom otions,  and  other  prom otional  offers.  Advertising  support  is  directed  at  advertising programs  and  supporting  independent  bottler  m edia.  New  product  support  includes  targeted  consum er  and  retailer  incentives  and  direct marketplace  support,  such  as  point-of-purchase  m aterials,  product  placem ent  fees,  m edia  and  advertising.  V ending  and  cooler  equipm ent placement programs support the acquisition and placem ent of vending m achines and cooler equipm ent. The nature and type of program s vary annually.\n\nChanges to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the continued growth of sales through e-com m erce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services and other direct-to-consum er businesses, the integration of physical and digital operations am ong retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard discounters, and the current econom ic environm ent continue to i n crease  the  i m portance  of  m ajor  custom ers.  In  2024,  sales  to  W alm art  Inc.

The loss of this custom er would have a m aterial adverse effect on our FLNA, QFNA and PBNA divisions.",

          "chunk_text": "and data systems or those of our suppliers, cybersecurity incidents including but not limited to ransomware attacks, misuse of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials (including water, recycled materials and materials that meet our labor standards), significant changes in trade policy, natural disasters, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise, acts of war or terrorism, disease outbreaks or other external factors over which we have no control, have at times interrupted and could, in the future, interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## Our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results.\n\nOur costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities (including certain petroleum-derived materials like resins and paperbased materials like pulp) and raw and packaging materials and the costs of labor, transportation (including trucks and containers), energy, pension and healthcare. Inflation pressures sometimes result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results depend, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations and to anticipate consumer reaction to our management of these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.\n\nThe consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry into certain categories and growth in hard discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to  successfully  manage  relationships  with  our  retail  trade  customers,  which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers, private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if the Company or one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients, negative perceptions of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleum-based materials), lack of recyclability  or  other  environmental  attributes,  concerns  about  actual  or  alleged  labor  or  equality  and  inclusion  practices,  privacy  failures  or  data  breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted, and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer. Our Company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental sustainability.

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) highlights that labor unrest is one of several risks associated with its global operations across more than 200 countries, noting that such disruptions could affect consumer confidence and product availability. Mondelez (MDLZ) specifically identifies labor unrest as a risk tied to its unionized workforce, with 55% of its 79,000 non-U.S. employees and 21% of its 12,000 U.S. employees potentially involved in strikes or work stoppages, as seen in its 2021 U.S. facility disruptions. Target (TGT) emphasizes that labor unrest or strikes in global transportation networks\u2014such as those affecting railways, trucking, waterways, and ports, especially in California\u2014could disrupt its inventory flow and increase costs. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies face labor-related risks, CL frames it broadly within geopolitical instability, MDLZ focuses on internal workforce dynamics and union activity, and TGT highlights external supply chain vulnerabilities tied to transportation labor disruptions.",

      "question": "How do COST, MDLZ, and PG differ in their specific treatment of non-lease components within lease agreements, particularly regarding material lease obligations, and what does this reveal about their lease cost recognition practices?",
      "answer": "COST, MDLZ, and PG all address non-lease components in their lease accounting, but they differ in their specific approaches and disclosures. COST states that non-lease components and the lease components to which they relate are accounted for together as a single lease component for all asset classes, and it notes that its leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. MDLZ indicates that many of its leases contain non-lease components (e.g., product costs, common-area or other maintenance costs) that relate to the lease components of the agreement, and it accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. PG combines lease and non-lease components for purposes of calculating lease liabilities and states that the most significant assets in its leasing portfolio relate to real estate and vehicles. These differences in treatment and disclosure suggest varying levels of granularity in how each company recognizes and manages lease-related costs, with COST and PG focusing on consolidated treatment while MDLZ provides more specific examples of non-lease elements.",

        "Hop 1: COST \u2192 Non-Lease Components: COST accounts for non-lease components and related lease components together as a single lease component for all asset classes and notes the absence of material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.",

        "Hop 3: PG \u2192 Non-Lease Components: PG combines lease and non-lease components for liability calculation and highlights that its most significant leased assets are real estate and vehicles, pointing to a focus on material asset categories."

      "question": "How did Colgate-Palmolive, Mondelez International, and Walmart each reflect the impact of operating in Argentina during 2021, particularly in terms of sales performance, currency risk exposure, and strategic decisions related to their presence in the country?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive reported that Argentina was among the countries driving organic sales growth in Latin America, contributing to a 7.0% increase in net sales in the region in 2021. Mondelez International noted that Argentina had become a highly inflationary economy, leading to a remeasurement loss of $13 million in 2021 and contributed $401 million in net revenues. Walmart had previously operated in Argentina but sold Walmart Argentina in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, exiting the market as part of a broader divestiture strategy. Combining these perspectives, we see that while Colgate and Mondelez maintained active operations with measurable financial outcomes tied to Argentina, Walmart exited the market, reflecting differing strategic responses to the country's economic conditions.",

          "chunk_text": "\nNet sales in Latin America increased 7.0% in 2021 to $3,663, as volume growth of 1.0% and net selling price increases of 7.0% were partially offset by negative foreign exchange of 1.0%. Organic sales in Latin America increased 8.0% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in Latin America in 2021 versus 2020 was due to increases in Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the bar soap and underarm protection categories. The increase in Home Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the fabric softener and liquid cleaner categories.\n\nOperating profit in Latin America increased 4% in 2021 to $1,012, while as a percentage of Net sales it decreased 90 bps to 27.6%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to a decrease in Gross profit (150 bps), partially offset by a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses (20 bps) and a decrease in Other (income) expense, net (40 bps), all as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (740 bps), which were partially offset by cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (330 bps) and higher pricing. This decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to decreased advertising investment (70 bps), partially offset by higher overhead expenses (50 bps), primarily driven by higher logistics costs. The decrease in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to a value added tax refund.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nArgentina. During the second quarter of 2018, primarily based on published estimates that indicated Argentina's threeyear cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%, we concluded that Argentina became a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes. As of July 1, 2018, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our Argentinean subsidiaries and changed their functional currency from the Argentinean peso to the U.S. dollar. On July 1, 2018, both monetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Argentinean pesos were remeasured into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, with remeasurement and other transaction gains and losses recorded in net earnings. As of December 31, 2021, our Argentinean operations had $9 million of Argentinean peso denominated net monetary assets. Our Argentinean operations contributed $401 million, or 1.4% of consolidated net revenues in 2021. We recorded a remeasurement loss of $13 million in 2021, a remeasurement loss of $9 million in 2020 and a remeasurement gain of $4 million in 2019 within selling, general and administrative expenses related to the revaluation of the Argentinean peso denominated net monetary position over these periods.\n\nBrexit . Following the separation of the United Kingdom from the European Union ('Brexit') in 2020, a new trade arrangement was reached between the U.K. and E.U. that began on January 1, 2021. The main trade provisions include the continuation of no tariffs or quotas on trade between the U.K. and E.U. subject to prescribed trade terms, including but not limited to meeting product and labeling standards for both the U.K. and E.U. Cross-border trade between the U.K. and E.U. is also subject to new customs regulations, documentation and reviews. To comply with the new requirements, we increased resources in customer service and logistics, in our factories, and on our customs support teams. We adapted our processes and systems for the new and increased number of customs transactions. We continue to closely monitor and manage our inventory levels of imported raw materials, packaging and finished goods in the U.K. We have made investments in resources, systems and processes to meet the new ongoing requirements and we work to mitigate disruptions to our local supply chain and distribution, including those related to the recent transportation labor shortage in the U.K., to reduce the impact on our input and distribution costs. Despite our efforts to control costs, we have seen inflationary cost pressures rise in our U.K. business this year, as we have also experienced in other markets. If the U.K.'s separation from, or new trade arrangements with, the E.U. negatively impact the U.K. economy or result in disagreements on trade terms, delays affecting our supply chain or distribution, disruptions to sales or collections, or further increases in inflationary cost pressures, the impact to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be material. In 2021, we generated 9.3% of our net revenues in the U.K.\n\nOther Countries . Since we sell our products in over 150 countries and have operations in approximately 80 countries, we monitor economic and currency-related risks and seek to take protective measures in response to these exposures. We continue to monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts to our `business operations, currencies and net monetary exposures. Since the global onset of COVID-19 in early 2020, most countries in which we do business experienced periods of significant economic uncertainty as well as exchange rate volatility. At this time, except for Argentina which is accounted for as a highly inflationary economy, we do not anticipate any other countries in which we operate to be at risk of becoming highly inflationary economies.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash:\n\nCash and cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. We also had restricted cash within other current assets of $7 million as of December 31, 2021 and $31 million as of December 31, 2020. Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $3,553 million as of December 31, 2021 and $3,650 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Allowances for Credit Losses:\n\nThe allowances for credit losses are recorded against our receivables. They are developed at a country and region level based on historical collection experiences, current economic condition of specific customers and the forecasted economic condition of countries using various factors such as bond default rates and consumption indexes. We write off receivables once it is determined that the receivables are no longer collectible and as allowed by local laws.",

Segments and Disaggregated Revenue\n\n## Segments\n\nThe Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 for discussion of recent divestitures. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\n\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.\n\nThe Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income before income taxes, is provided in the following table:\n\n",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive highlights nationalization as a general risk among broader geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties, particularly in markets affected by the war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East and Asia. Philip Morris International specifically flags the risk of nationalization in Russia, where it had significant operations and exposure, with 9% of cigarette and heated tobacco shipment volume and 6% of net revenues in 2023. Walmart identifies nationalization as part of broader regulatory and political risks in international markets, particularly in countries like India and Mexico, where foreign ownership restrictions and antitrust investigations are in place. While CL treats nationalization as a component of a broader set of international risks, PM directly ties it to its Russian operations and potential asset impairment, and WMT emphasizes regulatory constraints and ownership limitations in key international markets.",

PepsiCo identifies Coca-Cola as its primary beverage competitor within a broader peer group of international food and beverage companies, underscoring direct market rivalry. Philip Morris International includes Coca-Cola in its peer group based on global presence, consumer product focus, and similar revenue and market capitalization, aligning with a more generalized consumer staples benchmark. This reveals that while all three companies view Coca-Cola as a relevant peer, their strategic rationale for inclusion varies\u2014ranging from category-specific alignment to competitive positioning to broad financial comparability.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Argentina's volatile economic and political environment affected each company differently. PepsiCo noted exposure to foreign exchange risk in Argentina and other markets, with currency fluctuations potentially impacting financial results. Procter & Gamble specifically cited Argentina among countries where significant exchange rate fluctuations had a material impact on net sales and earnings, and where pricing adjustments were made to offset currency effects. Walmart exited the Argentine market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, prior to 2022, and no longer had operational exposure in 2022.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nInflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' for further discussion.\n\n## Commodity Prices\n\nOur  commodity  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $1.6  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $1.1 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  At  the  end  of  2021,  the  potential  change  in  fair  value  of  commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $177 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nOur operations outside of the United States generated 44% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa, collectively, comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks  in  the  international  markets  in  which  our  products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2021,  favorable  foreign  exchange  contributed  1  percentage  point  to  net  revenue  growth,  primarily  due  to appreciation  in  the  Mexican  peso,  Canadian  dollar  and  South African  rand.  Currency  declines  against  the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.\n\nIn addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold,  including  in Argentina,  Brazil,  China,  Mexico,  the Middle  East,  Russia  and  Turkey,  and  currency  controls  or  fluctuations  in  certain  of  these  international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments.\n\nOur foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $1.9 billion  as  of  December 26, 2020. At the end of 2021, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $278 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.\n\nThe total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nOur interest  rate  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $2.1  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $3.0 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  Assuming  year-end  2021  investment  levels  and  variable  rate  debt,  a  1percentage-point  increase  in  interest  rates  would  have  decreased  our  net  interest  expense  in  2021  by  $47 million  due  to  higher  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  levels,  as  compared  with  our variable rate debt.\n\n## OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\n## Results of Operations - Consolidated Review\n\n## Volume\n\nPhysical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions,  including  the  preparation  of  our  annual  operating  plan  and  the  evaluation  of  our  business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level.",

Net  sales  could  also  be  adversely  impacted  following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on the consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including     supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. If we  are not successful in  executing  and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our  gross  margin,  operating  margin,  net  earnings  and  cash flows.\n\nForeign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure  to  the  fluctuation  of  exchange  rates.  Translation exposures relate to exchange  rate impacts of  measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a  currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation  of  transaction-related  working  capital  balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In  the  past  three  years,  a  number  of  foreign  currencies  have weakened  versus  the  U.S.  dollar,  leading  to  lower  sales  and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries  that  recently  had  and  are  currently  experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Russia. These fluctuations have significantly  impacted  our  historical  net  sales,  costs  and  net earnings  and  could  do  so  in  the  future.  Increased  pricing  in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  may  offset  portions  of  the  currency  impacts  but  could also  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  consumption  of  our products,  which  would  negatively  affect  our  net  sales,  gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nGovernment Policies. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative,  regulatory  or  enforcement  policies.  For  example, our  net  earnings  and  cash  flows  could  be  affected  by  any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under  the  current  work  being  led  by  the  OECD  for  the  G20 focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the  Economy.\"  The  breadth  of  the  OECD  project  extends beyond pure digital businesses, and if agreed and enacted by most  countries,  is  likely  to  impact  most  large  multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and broadly  establishing  a  15%  minimum  tax  on  their  foreign operations. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and  climate change  matters.  Additionally, we  attempt  to carefully  manage  our  debt,  currency  and  other  exposures  in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and  pricing  controls,  such  as  Nigeria,  Turkey, Argentina  and Egypt. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere.  Changes  in  government  policies  in  these  areas might  cause  an  increase  or  decrease  in  our  net  sales,  gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nCOVID-19  Pandemic. Because  we  sell  products  that  are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nHowever, the continued evolution of the pandemic may result in economic recessions or a slowdown of economic growth in certain countries or regions. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products (due to governmental actions or  key  material,  transportation  and  labor  shortages  impacting our  ability  to  produce  and  ship  products)  or  could  impact consumers'  movements  and  access  to  our  products.  There could also be reduced demand due to consumption decreases and consumer pantry destocking (particularly, in home cleaning,  health  and  hygiene  products)  as  economic  activity resumes  following  slowdowns  or  relaxation  of  governmental restrictions.  Net,  the  uncertainty  in  the  timing  and  extent  of demand  volatility,  the  relaxation  and  reimplementation  of movement  restrictions,  the  timing  and  impact  of  potential consumer pantry destocking, the future economic trends due to a  resurgence  of  positive  cases  and  governmental  actions  in response  to  the  pandemic  may  result  in  heightened  volatility and negative impacts to net sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the pandemic.\n\nWhile we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets due primarily to the restriction of employee movements, key material and labor shortages and transportation constraints. We intend to continue to work with our suppliers and government authorities to implement employee  safety  measures  to  minimize  disruption  to  the manufacturing and distribution of our products. The continued evolution of the pandemic and uncertainty with regards to the disruptions  caused  either  by  resurgence  of  positive  cases  or governmental actions in response to the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain and impact our operations (for example, the closure of a key manufacturing or distribution  facility  or  the  inability  of  a  key  material  or transportation supplier to source and transport materials).\n\nThe pandemic has not had a material negative impact on the Company's liquidity position. We continue to generate operating  cash  flows  to  meet  our  short-term  liquidity  needs and continue to maintain access to capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings.\n\nRussia-Ukraine  War .  The  war  between  Russia  and  Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both countries. Our Ukraine  business  includes  two  manufacturing  sites.  We  have approximately  500  employees  including  both  manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. Our operations in Ukraine accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in fiscal 2022. Additionally, net assets of our Ukraine subsidiary, along",

Segments and Disaggregated Revenue\n\n## Segments\n\nThe Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 for discussion of recent divestitures. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\n\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.\n\nThe Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM.

      "answer": "MDLZ notes that it generated 73.4% of its 2023 net revenues outside the U.S., and specifically highlights currency exchange controls as a risk, citing Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye as examples where it applied highly inflationary accounting. PG states that over 50% of its annual net sales come from non-U.S. markets and emphasizes that currency exchange controls and import restrictions in certain countries could impede business operations and repatriation of earnings. PM highlights that it is a U.S. holding company reliant on distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries, and warns that currency exchange controls in certain jurisdictions could restrict its ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars or make international payments. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies face currency exchange control risks, MDLZ emphasizes operational impacts in specific countries, PG focuses on the broader implications for international cash flows and competitiveness, and PM underscores structural financial risks tied to repatriation and local currency devaluation.",

The  Company  believes  the  LIFO  method  more  fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation or deflation rates and inventory levels have been determined.  Due  to  inflation,  a  $438  charge  was  recorded  during  2022  to  merchandise  costs  to  increase  the cumulative LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories at August 28, 2022. An immaterial LIFO charge was recorded in 2021. Canadian and Other International merchandise inventories are predominantly valued using the cost and retail inventory methods, respectively, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.\n\nThe Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts using estimates based on experience.  The  provision  is  adjusted  periodically  to  reflect  physical  inventory  counts,  which  generally  occur  in  the second and fourth fiscal quarters.

Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.\n\n## Other Matters\n\nIn Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned \"Contingencies\" and appears in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \"Item 8.

In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates.\n\nManagement continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.\n\n## Inventories\n\nWe value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\").",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) applies a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units at the grant date and recognizes the $26 million in total unrecognized compensation expense ratably over the performance period. Mondelez (MDLZ) also uses the Monte Carlo simulation model for the market-based total shareholder return component of its performance share units (PSUs), incorporating the probability of achieving the market condition, with compensation expense recognized based on grant date fair values regardless of whether the condition is met. Procter & Gamble (PG) utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation model for performance stock units and notes that its assumptions are not substantially different from those used for stock options, which include volatility estimates based on historical and implied data, employee behavior patterns, and risk-free interest rates. The synthesis reveals that while all three companies use Monte Carlo models for performance-based awards, CL focuses on expense timing, MDLZ emphasizes market condition probability, and PG aligns assumptions with broader equity compensation practices.",

For example, in January 2025, in a patent lawsuit adjudicated before the ITC, the ITC imposed a ban on the importation of NJOY ACE into the United States and the sale and marketing of NJOY ACE products previously imported into the United States. If the ban on the importation into the United States and the sale and marketing of NJOY ACE becomes effective, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the NJOY  Transaction.\n\nIf the NJOY Transaction or any other acquisition, disposition, joint venture, investment in a third party or other strategic relationship is not successful, there could be a material negative impact on our business, financial position and results of operations and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\n## Significant changes in price, availability or quality of tobacco, other raw materials or component parts could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and business.\n\nShifts in crops (such as those driven by macroeconomic conditions and adverse weather patterns), government restrictions and mandated prices, production control programs, economic trade sanctions, import duties and tariffs, international trade disruptions, labor disruptions, inflation, geopolitical instability, climate and environmental changes and disruptions due to man-made or natural disasters may increase the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco and other raw materials, ingredients and component parts used to manufacture our products. Any significant change in such factors could restrict our ability to continue manufacturing and marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability and have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\n\nFor varieties of tobacco only available in limited geographies, government-mandated prices and production control programs, political instability or government prohibitions on the import or export of tobacco in certain countries pose additional risks to price, availability and quality. As consumer demand increases for innovative smoke-free products and decreases for combustible and MST products, the volume of tobacco leaf required for production of these products has decreased, resulting in reduced tobacco leaf demand. Reduced demand for tobacco leaf may result in the reduced supply and availability of domestic tobacco and increased costs, as growers divert resources to other crops or cease farming. Macroeconomic factors, such as tariffs, may exacerbate reductions in demand for tobacco leaf by increasing the cost of purchasing tobacco leaf from a supplier in another country. The unavailability or unacceptability of any one or more particular varieties of tobacco leaf or the unavailability of nicotine ex tract necessary to manufacture our operating companies' products could negatively impact our ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability. In addition, the nicotine used in our operating companies' innovative smoke-free products is extracted from tobacco produced in one country. If we are unable to identify alternate sources of nicotine for our operating companies' innovative products, we could be exposed to the risks discussed above.\n\nCurrent geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions (including tariffs, inflation, high interest rates, labor shortages, supply and demand imbalances and international armed conflicts) are causing worldwide disruptions and delays to supply chains and commercial markets, which limit access to, and increase the cost of, raw materials, ingredients and component parts (for example, wood tips used in our cigar products and aluminum used in our packaging). As consumer demand increases for innovative smoke-free products and decreases for combustible and MST products, the volume of raw materials, ingredients and component parts required for the production of these products has decreased. Reduced demand for raw materials, ingredients and component parts may reduce supply and availability and increase the cost of raw materials, ingredients and component parts as suppliers divert resources to other products or cease producing these products. Furthermore, challenging economic conditions can create the risk that our suppliers, distributors, logistics providers or other third-party partners suffer financial or operational difficulties, which may impact their ability to provide us with or distribute finished product, raw materials and component parts and services in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to identify alternate sources of raw materials, ingredients and component parts for our operating companies' products, we could be exposed to supply risk.\n\nIn addition, government taxes, restrictions and prohibitions on the sale and use of certain products may limit access to, and increase the costs of, raw materials and component parts and, potentially, impede our ability to sell certain of our products. For ex ample, certain states have passed ex tended producer responsibility legislation concerning packaging.

      "question": "How do Colgate-Palmolive (CL), Mondelez (MDLZ), and PepsiCo (PEP) each apply Monte Carlo simulation models in their valuation of performance-based compensation, and what does this reveal about differences in their approach to estimating fair value for stock and cash awards?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of performance-based restricted stock unit awards, with $26 million of unrecognized compensation expense tied to these awards as of December 31, 2023. Mondelez applies the Monte Carlo simulation specifically to determine the grant date fair value of PSUs based on the market-based total shareholder return condition, incorporating the probability of achieving that condition in its valuation. PepsiCo utilizes the Monte Carlo simulation model to mark-to-market long-term cash awards that are liability-based, tying these awards to total shareholder return relative to a peer group over a three-year performance period. Together, these approaches reveal that while all three companies rely on Monte Carlo modeling for fair value estimation, they apply it differently depending on the nature of the award\u2014whether equity-based or liability-based\u2014and the specific performance or market conditions involved.",

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola (KO), Mondelez (MDLZ), and PepsiCo (PEP) each approach productivity initiatives in response to rising operating costs, and what does this reveal about their differing cost management strategies in 2023?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) acknowledges that productivity initiatives may not be sufficient to offset rising input and operational costs, particularly in the face of inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions. Mondelez (MDLZ) actively manages operating costs through structured programs like the 'Simplify to Grow' initiative, which targets significant reductions in supply chain and overhead costs. PepsiCo (PEP) evaluates productivity initiatives beyond its formal 2019 Productivity Plan but reported no material charges related to such efforts outside of previously established restructuring accruals. This reveals that while all three companies are focused on cost control, KO expresses caution about the effectiveness of such initiatives, MDLZ has a proactive and structured approach, and PEP takes a more measured and incremental stance.",

      "question": "How do Colgate-Palmolive (CL), PepsiCo (PEP), and Philip Morris International (PM) each apply the Monte Carlo Simulation Model in their valuation of stock-based compensation or long-term incentive awards, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to incorporating market-based performance conditions?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive uses the Monte Carlo simulation model specifically for valuing performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs) that include a total shareholder return (TSR) modifier, which is considered a market condition. PepsiCo applies the Monte Carlo simulation model for long-term cash awards that qualify as liability awards, valuing them on a mark-to-market basis through the end of the performance period. Philip Morris International utilizes the Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the grant date fair value of performance share unit (PSU) awards tied to TSR performance factors. This reveals that all three companies incorporate the Monte Carlo model to address market-based performance conditions, but each applies it to different types of compensation instruments\u2014CL to RSUs, PEP to long-term cash awards, and PM to PSUs.",

The Company's derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. For fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative, as well as the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item, are recognized in earnings each period. For cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings when the offsetting effect of the hedged item is also recognized in earnings. For hedges of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. Cash flows related to hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged item in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nThe Company may also enter into certain foreign currency and interest rate instruments that economically hedge certain of its risks but do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in fair value of these derivative instruments, based on quoted market prices, are recognized in earnings each period. The Company's derivative instruments and other financial instruments are more fully described in Note 7, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments along with the related fair value measurement considerations.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units (both performance-based and time-vested), based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant over the requisite service period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton ('Black-Scholes') option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. In addition to performance conditions, performance-based restricted stock units also include a total shareholder return modifier. Because the total shareholder return modifier is considered a market condition, the Company uses a Monte-Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units. The fair value of time-vested restricted stock units is determined based on the closing market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant. Stock-based compensation plans, related expenses and assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are more fully described in Note 8, Capital Stock and Stock-Based Compensation Plans.\n\n## Currency Translation\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other than those operating in highly inflationary environments, are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.\n\nFor subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, local currency-denominated non-monetary assets, including inventories, goodwill and property, plant and equipment, are remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while local currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company.",

RISK FACTORS\n\nIn addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report, set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities. These risks, some of which have occurred and/or are occurring and any of which could occur in the future, are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.\n\n## Business and Industry Risks\n\n## We face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nWe operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately 70% of our Net sales originating in markets outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we face risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:\n\n- changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of inflation, volatile commodity prices and increases in the cost of raw and packaging materials, labor, energy and logistics;\n- political or economic instability, geopolitical events, environmental events, widespread health emergencies, such as COVID19 or other pandemics or epidemics, natural disasters or social or labor unrest;\n- changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows from non-U.S. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars, in those markets;\n- exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import or export raw materials or finished product, including as a result of COVID-19, or to repatriate earnings from overseas;\n- lack of well-established, reliable and/or impartial legal systems in certain countries where we operate and difficulties in enforcing contractual, intellectual property or other legal rights;\n- foreign ownership and investment restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources; and\n- changes to trade policies and agreements and other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of and/or the increase in onerous trade restrictions and/or tariffs, sanctions, price controls, labor laws, travel or immigration restrictions, including as a result of COVID-19 or other pandemics or epidemics, profit controls or other government controls.\n\nAny or all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings.\n\nIn addition, there continue to be uncertainties related to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union ('EU') (commonly referred to as Brexit), including the long-term impact of the bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU (the 'EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement'). These uncertainties include the impact of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on businesses in the EU and the United Kingdom and how the new relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom will develop over time, including disruptions to trade and the free movement of goods, services and people to and from the United Kingdom, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the British pound and/or the euro and disruptions to our workforce and that of",

Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions), monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights.\n\n## Changes  in  accounting  standards  and  subjective  assumptions,  estimates  and  judgments  by  management related  to  complex  accounting  matters  could  significantly  affect  our  financial  condition  and  results  of operations.\n\nAccounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including self-insurance liabilities, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying  assumptions,  estimates  or  judgments  by  our  management  could  significantly  change  our  reported  or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## We are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\nSection  404  of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act  of  2002  requires  management  assessments  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.\n\n## Changes in tax rates, new U.S. or foreign tax legislation, and exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally,  at  any  point  in  time,  we  may  be  under  examination  for  value  added,  sales-based,  payroll, product,  import  or  other  non-income  taxes.  We  may  recognize  additional  tax  expense,  be  subject  to  additional  tax liabilities,  or  incur  losses  and  penalties,  due  to  changes  in  laws,  regulations,  administrative  practices,  principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries,  a  change  in  earnings  attributable  to  the  various  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate  could  result  in  an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Significant  changes  in  or  failure  to  comply  with  regulations  relating  to  the  use,  storage,  discharge  and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are  subject  to  a  wide  and  increasingly  broad  array  of  federal,  state,  regional,  local  and  international  laws  and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes  and  other  environmental  matters.  Failure  to  comply  with  these  laws  could  result  in  harm  to  our  members, employees or others, significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or  the  imposition  of  severe  penalties  or  restrictions  on  operations  by  governmental  agencies  or  courts  that  could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",

References to our sustainability reports and website are for informational purposes  only  and  neither  the  sustainability  reports  nor  the other information on our website is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nWe  discuss  our  expectations  regarding  future  performance, events  and  outcomes,  such  as  our  business  outlook  and objectives in this Form 10-K, as well as in our quarterly and annual reports, current reports on Form 8-K, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for  historical  and  present  factual  information,  are  'forwardlooking  statements'  and  are  based  on  financial  data  and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. We assume no  obligation  to  update  any  forward-looking  statements  as  a result  of  new  information,  future  events  or  other  factors, except to the extent required by law. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize  that events could  significantly differ  from  our expectations.\n\nThe following discussion of 'risk factors' identifies significant factors  that  may  adversely  affect  our  business,  operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and  Analysis and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes incorporated in this report. The following  discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider  when  evaluating  our  expectations.  These  and  other factors  could  cause  our  future  results  to  differ  from  those  in the  forward-looking  statements  and  from  historical  trends, perhaps materially.\n\n## MACROECONOMIC  CONDITIONS  AND  RELATED FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nOur  business  is  subject  to  numerous  risks  as  a  result  of having  significant  operations  and  sales  in  international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility.\n\nWe are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries  and  products  sold  in  approximately  180  countries and territories around the world.  We  hold assets, incur liabilities,  generate  sales  and  pay  expenses  in  a  variety  of currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar,  and  our  operations outside the U.S. generate more than fifty percent of our annual net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have  and  could  continue  to  reduce  the  U.S.  dollar  value  of sales,  earnings  and  cash  flows  we  receive  from  non-U.S. markets,  increase  our  supply  costs  (as  measured  in  U.S. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition. Further, we have  a significant  amount  of  foreign  currency  debt  and derivatives  as part of  our  capital  markets  activities.  The maturity cash outflows of these instruments could be adversely impacted by significant appreciation of foreign currency exchange rates (particularly the Euro), which could adversely impact  our  overall  cash  flows.  Moreover,  discriminatory  or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries, including  changes  to  tariffs  and  existing  trade  policies  and agreements,  could  adversely  affect  our  results.  See  also  the Results of Operations and Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity sections of the MD&amp;A  and  the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.\n\nWe  also  have  businesses  and  maintain  local  currency  cash balances  in  a  number  of  countries  with  currency  exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls or restrictions, such as Nigeria, Turkey, Argentina and Egypt. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could  be adversely  impacted  if  we  are  unable  to  successfully  manage such controls and restrictions, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased  tariffs,  quotas,  exchange  or  price  controls,  trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business.\n\nAdditionally, our business, operations or employees have been and could continue to be adversely affected (including by the need  to  de-consolidate  or  even  exit  certain  businesses  in particular countries) by political volatility, labor market disruptions  or  other  crises  or  vulnerabilities  in  individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval or acts of war (such as the Russia-Ukraine War) and the related government and other entity responses, broad  economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration  in  the  creditworthiness  of  local  governments, particularly in emerging markets.\n\nUncertain  economic  or  social  conditions  may  adversely impact  demand  for  our  products  or  cause  our  customers and  other  business  partners  to  suffer  financial  hardship, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand  for  our  products  related  to  one  or  more  significant local, regional or global economic or social disruptions. These disruptions  have  included  and  may  in  the  future  include:  a slow-down, recession or inflationary pressures in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for  our  suppliers,  vendors  or  customers;  a  significant  shift  in government policies; significant social unrest; the deterioration of economic  relations between  countries or regions, including potential negative consumer sentiment toward  non-local  products  or  sources;  or  the  inability  to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries  to  pay  funds  to  or  collect  funds  from  our customers,  vendors  and  suppliers.  Additionally,  these  and other economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third-party partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services  we  need,  in  which  case  our  business  and  results  of operations could be adversely affected.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) reports that in 2024, an average of 295,968 stock options and 100,191 restricted stock units (RSUs) were anti-dilutive and excluded from diluted EPS calculations. Costco (COST) only mentions RSUs in the context of diluted EPS, using the treasury stock method but without disclosing specific anti-dilutive amounts. Mondelez (MDLZ) states that 3.4 million anti-dilutive Mondel\u0113z International stock options and long-term incentive plan shares were excluded from diluted EPS for 2024.

Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activ ities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrativ e expenses), amortization of intangible assets, gains and losses on div estitures and acquisitions and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrativ e expenses) in all periods presented. We exclude these items from segment operating income in order to prov ide better transparency of our segment operating results. Furthermore, we centrally manage benefit plan non-serv ice income and interest and other expense, net. We do not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that our CODM rev iews.

      "answer": "MDLZ discusses the broad regulatory environment, including customs duties as part of cross-border trade concessions or border barriers, and highlights the potential impact of over 25 countries in the EU implementing extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies, with similar developments in India, Vietnam, and certain U.S. states. PM faces a specific customs-related legal proceeding in Thailand, where it was fined approximately THB 130 million ($3.6 million) after an appellate court affirmed under-declaration of import prices, though the company continues to appeal the decision. TGT emphasizes the risk of increased costs due to potential changes in U.S. tax or trade policy, particularly with China as its largest import source, and notes that additional tariffs or duties could require price increases or sourcing from alternative vendors. Collectively, these disclosures reveal that while MDLZ focuses on regulatory trends and compliance programs, PM is directly involved in a high-profile customs enforcement case, and TGT is concerned with macro-level trade policy shifts affecting its supply chain and pricing strategy.",

      "question": "How do Costco, Coca-Cola, and Mondelez each leverage or protect their intellectual property\u2014particularly copyrights\u2014to maintain competitive differentiation in the consumer staples sector, and what specific aspects of their strategies reflect the importance of these rights in their respective product portfolios?",
      "answer": "Costco emphasizes the value of copyrights and other intellectual property in supporting its private-label brand, Kirkland Signature, which plays a key role in differentiating merchandise offerings and improving margins. Coca-Cola owns numerous copyrights related to beverage formulas, packaging, and software, which are integral to its product development and production processes. Mondelez highlights its reliance on a combination of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws globally to protect its valuable intellectual property, particularly in the context of evolving AI technologies and digital environments. Together, these companies demonstrate a strategic emphasis on intellectual property as a core asset for maintaining competitive advantage, though each tailors its approach based on product type and market dynamics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COST \u2192 Copyrights: Costco references the importance of copyrights as part of its intellectual property portfolio, specifically noting that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered at lower prices than national brands, and contribute to higher margins and merchandise differentiation.",
        "Hop 2: KO \u2192 Copyrights: Coca-Cola explicitly states ownership of numerous copyrights related to beverage products, packaging, and software, indicating their role in supporting proprietary processes and protecting critical formulas and technologies.",
        "Hop 3: MDLZ \u2192 Copyrights: Mondelez emphasizes the need to protect its intellectual property, including copyrights, through a mix of legal frameworks globally, noting that failure to do so\u2014especially in light of emerging AI technologies\u2014could harm its business and competitive standing."

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive actively mitigates interest rate volatility by using interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps to manage its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt, ensuring that the terms of these swaps match the underlying debt structure. Coca-Cola, on the other hand, is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to both existing and future debt issuances and estimates that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased its interest expense by $125 million in 2021. Mondelez notes its exposure to interest rate volatility that could impact future borrowing costs and mentions that it hedges against such risks, though it does not specify the instruments used.

Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material, as it is the Company's policy to contract only with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, sourcing strategies, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company's treasury and risk management policies, which prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose. It is the Company's policy to enter into derivative instrument contracts with terms that match the underlying exposure being hedged. Provided below are details of the Company's exposures by type of risk and derivative instruments by type of hedge designation.\n\n## Valuation Considerations\n\nThe Company's derivative instruments include interest rate swap contracts, forward-starting interest rate swaps, foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts. The Company utilizes interest rate swap contracts to manage its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt, and these swaps are classified as follows:\n\n- Level 1: Based upon quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2: Based upon observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n- Level 3: Based upon unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements.\n\nThe Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates (Level 2 valuation).\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company utilizes forwardstarting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rate for future debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates (Level 2 valuation).",

          "chunk_text": "Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are recorded in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. Refer to the heading 'Operations Review - Other Income (Loss) - Net' above. The Company recorded net foreign currency exchange losses of $61 million and $64 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices\n\nInflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.\n\n## ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nOur Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures, fluctuations in the values of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the values of the underlying exposures.\n\nWe monitor our exposure to market risks using several objective measurement systems, including a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our hedging transactions and derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\n\nWe manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 2021, we used 70 functional currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar and generated $25.6 billion of our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States; therefore, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nOur Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency options and collars (principally euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to foreign currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\n\nThe total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives were $13,691 million and $16,663 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These values included derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting as well as economic hedges. The fair value of foreign currency derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $174 million as of December 31, 2021, and we estimate that a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar would have decreased the net unrealized gain to $172 million. The fair value of the foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $10 million as of December 31, 2021, and we estimate that a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $58 million increase in fair value.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. We monitor our mix of fixedrate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of short-term debt and long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.\n\nBased on the Company's variable-rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2021, we estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by $125 million in 2021. However, this increase in interest expense would have been partially offset by the increase in interest income due to higher interest rates.\n\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk related to its investments in highly liquid debt securities. These investments are primarily managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company's investment policy. Our policy requires these investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the risk of principal loss. In addition, our policy",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe may be unaware of potential third-party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our technology, brands or products. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert management's and other key personnel's attention from our business operations. Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to pay monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products, which could include removal of existing products from sale. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our reputation, brand health, ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products, product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\n## We face risks related to tax matters, including changes in tax laws and rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes.\n\nIn December 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation ('U.S. tax reform') and we have factored the original legislation as well as additional guidance issued through 2021 into our financial results of operations as applicable. During November 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that contains significant changes to current rules but the Senate has not yet acted on it. Adoption of new U.S. tax rules could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nTax legislation enacted by foreign jurisdictions could significantly affect our ongoing operations, including rate changes as well as additional corporate tax provisions that could disallow or tax perceived base erosion or profit shifting payments or subject us to new types of tax. During December 2021, the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') released model rules for a global minimum tax, which could have a material adverse effect on us if enacted. Also see Note 16, Income Taxes , for details of the 2019 enacted Swiss tax law changes. Finally, aspects of U.S. tax laws may lead foreign jurisdictions to respond by enacting additional tax legislation that is unfavorable to us.\n\nAdverse changes in the underlying profitability or financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets and result in a charge to our income tax provision. Additionally, changes in tax laws in the U.S. or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities and our income tax provision.\n\nWe are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liabilities, including interest and penalties. Unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could significantly adversely affect our income tax provision, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\n\n## We are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we sold our products in over 150 countries and had operations in approximately 80 countries. Consequently, a significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our financial position and operating results are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes or converted into U.S. dollars to service obligations such as our U.S. dollar-denominated indebtedness and to pay dividends to our shareholders. In addition, movements in currency exchange rates affect transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries. Our efforts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily on cross-currency transactions, may not be successful. We hedge a number of risks including exposures to foreign exchange rate movements and volatility of interest rates that could impact our future borrowing costs. Hedging of these risks could potentially subject us to counter-party credit risk. In addition, local economies, monetary policies and currency hedging availability affect our ability to hedge against currency-related economic losses. We might not be able to successfully mitigate our exposure to currency risks due to factors such as continued global and local market volatility, actions by foreign governments, political uncertainty, inflation and limited hedging opportunities. Accordingly, changes in the currency exchange rates that we use to translate our results into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes or for transactions involving multiple currencies could materially and adversely affect future demand for our products, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees in the short or long-term.",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 1\n\n## SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company's (the \"Company,\" \"Procter &amp; Gamble,\"  \"we\"  or  \"us\")  business  is  focused  on  providing branded  consumer  packaged  goods  of  superior  quality  and value.  Our  products  are  sold  in  approximately  180  countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, ecommerce  (including  social  commerce)  channels,  grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors,  wholesalers,  specialty  beauty  stores  (including airport  duty-free  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies, electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell direct  to  consumers.  We  have  on-the-ground  operations  in approximately 70 countries.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its  controlled  subsidiaries.  Intercompany  transactions  are eliminated.\n\nBecause  of  a  lack  of  control  over  Venezuelan  subsidiaries caused by a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not consolidated  for  any  year  presented.  We  account  for  those subsidiaries at cost, less impairments, plus or minus observable price changes.\n\nBeginning in fiscal year 2022, the Company began to present increases and reductions in short-term debt with maturities of more  than  three  months  separately  within  the  Consolidated Statements  of  Cash  Flows.  The  presentation  for  the  twelve months  ended  June  30,  2021,  and  June  30,  2020,  have  been revised  to  align  with  the  current  period  presentation.  This change  had  no  impact  on  total  financing  activities,  and  we have concluded the change is not material.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of  America  (U.S.  GAAP)  requires  management  to  make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge  of  current  events  and  actions  the  Company  may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among  other  items,  consumer  and  trade  promotion  accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, postretirement benefits, stock options,  valuation  of  acquired  intangible  assets,  useful  lives for  depreciation  and  amortization  of  long-lived  assets,  future cash  flows  associated  with  impairment  testing  for  goodwill, indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  and  other  long-lived  assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax positions  and  contingencies.  Actual  results  may  ultimately differ from estimates, although management does not generally believe such differences would materially affect the financial statements in any individual year. However, regarding ongoing  impairment  testing  of  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus  those  anticipated  at  the  time  of  the  initial  valuations, could  result  in  impairment  charges  that  materially  affect  the financial statements in a given year.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product  to  customers.  Those  sales  predominantly  contain  a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single  point  in  time  when  ownership,  risks  and  rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt  by  the  customer.  A  provision  for  payment  discounts and  product  return  allowances  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of sales  in  the  same  period  the  revenue  is  recognized.  The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect  on  behalf  of  governmental  authorities.  The  revenue includes  shipping  and  handling  costs,  which  generally  are included in the list price to the customer.\n\nTrade  promotions,  consisting  primarily  of  customer  pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending,  which  is  recognized  as  incurred  at  the  time  of  the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are  included  as  accrued  marketing  and  promotion  in  the Accrued  and  other  liabilities  line  item  in  the  Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Cost of Products Sold\n\nCost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials  and  supplies  consumed  in  the  manufacturing  of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expenses necessary to acquire and convert the  purchased  materials  and  supplies  into  finished  products. Cost  of  products  sold  also  includes  the  cost  to  distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs,  warehousing  costs  and  other  shipping  and  handling activity.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expense\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense (SG&amp;A) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research  and  development  costs,  administrative  and  other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items. Research and development costs are charged to  expense  as  incurred  and  were  $2.0  billion  in  2022,  $1.9 billion  in  2021  and  $1.8  billion  in  2020.  Advertising  costs, charged to expense as incurred, include worldwide television, print,  radio,  internet  and  in-store  advertising  expenses  and were $7.9 billion in 2022, $8.2 billion in 2021 and $7.3 billion in 2020. Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending reported  in  SG&amp;A include  costs  associated  with  consumer  promotions,  product sampling and sales aids.",

          "chunk_text": "Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.\n\nThe Walmart U.S. business also includes an in-house advertising offering via Walmart Connect, supply chain and fulfillment capabilities to online marketplace sellers via Walmart Fulfillment Services, and access to quality, affordable healthcare via Walmart Health. In Fiscal 2022, Walmart U.S. initiatives also included the launch of a B2B last mile delivery service platform via Walmart GoLocal, and Walmart Luminate which provides a suite of data products to merchants and suppliers. Additional service offerings include fuel, financial services and related products (including through our digital channels, stores and clubs as well as our previously announced fintech joint venture), such as money orders, prepaid access, money transfers, check cashing, bill payment, and certain types of installment lending. Combined, these offerings do not currently represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues.\n\nOperations. Walmart U.S. is available to customers through supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets, as well as online or through the mobile application 24 hours a day. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart U.S. continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help stores operate more efficiently, such as pickup and delivery, Walmart+, shipfrom-store and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences.\n\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.\n\nCompetition. Walmart U.S. competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercentertype stores, eCommerce retailers, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers, and greater brand recognition. They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.\n\nOur ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. We employ many strategies and programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These strategies include the following:\n\n- EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;\n- EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers;\n- Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery and our Walmart+ membership offering, all of which enhance convenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served; and\n- Expanding our flywheel and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital advertising, fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial services.\n\nDistribution. We utilize a total of 157 distribution facilities which are located strategically throughout the U.S. For fiscal 2022, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 31 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as leveraging our ability to ship or deliver directly from more than 3,500 stores.\n\n## Walmart International Segment\n\nWalmart International is our second largest segment and operated in 23 countries outside of the U.S. as of January 31, 2022. Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, and China, and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa (which includes Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), India, as well as Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua).

Specifically, the predicted physical effects of climate change may ex acerbate challenges regarding the availability and quality of water and the cost, quality and availability of raw and packaging materials, pose physical risks to our facilities and those of our key suppliers, disrupt our global supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition, the increased concern over climate change has resulted and is likely to continue to result in transition risks, including additional legal and regulatory requirements intended to, among other things, reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change and have related and may relate to, among other things, greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., carbon pricing), alternative energy policy and additional disclosure obligations, such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, and extended producer responsibility obligations that relate to our product packaging. Such additional regulations may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition by increasing our compliance and manufacturing costs and/or negatively impacting our reputation if we are unable to, or are perceived (whether or not valid) not to, satisfy such requirements or expectations. Achieving our sustainability and social impact targets will require significant efforts from us and our stakeholders, such as our suppliers and other third parties. It will also require capital investment, additional ex pense (e.g., renewable energy costs) and the development of technology that may not currently exist. Failure to achieve our sustainability and social impact targets or the perception (whether or not valid) that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change or other sustainability matters, could result in adverse publicity and increased litigation risk and adversely affect our business and reputation. There is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers, consumers, regulators, our employees and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability and social impact matters, including responsible sourcing, deforestation, animal welfare, labor, employment and human rights, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging, including single-use and other plastic packaging. From many of these stakeholders, there is also a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredient transparency, such as sources of palm oil and palm kernel oil, and an increased focus on reducing our impact on nature. Our reputation could be damaged if we do not (or are perceived not to) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Our reliance on third parties in many aspects of our business could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nWe use third parties including, but not limited to, suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, commercial banks and other external business partners, to support many aspects of our business including those that provide support across much of the lifespan of our products from the purchasing of ingredients up to and including the sale of our products to consumers. While we maintain robust policies and procedures to govern and manage our interactions with and requirements of these third parties, including building in redundancies and alternatives wherever possible, we inherently have a lesser degree of control over the business operations, governance and compliance of these unrelated entities. As a result, disruptions in these relationships or the failure of these third parties to meet their obligations to us could have an adverse effect on our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Our business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nOur business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. and abroad. Such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products, including their development, ingredients, formulation, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, transportation, distribution, ex port, import, advertising, sale and environmental impact.

At the same time, stakeholders and regulators hav e increasingly expressed or pursued opposing v iews, legislation and inv estment expectations  with  respect  to  sustainability  initiativ es,  including  the  enactment  or  proposal  of  'Anti-ESG'  legislation  or  policies.  If  our  sustainability practices do not meet ev olv ing inv estor or other stakeholder expectations and standards or if we are unable to satisfy all stakeholders, our reputation, our ability  to  attract  or  retain  employees,  our  sales  and  our  attractiv eness  as  an  inv estment,  business  partner  or  as  an  acquiror  could  be  negativ ely impacted. Similarly, our failure or perceiv ed failure to pursue or fulfill our goals, targets and objectiv es, to comply with ethical, env ironmental or other standards, regulations or expectations, or to satisfy v arious reporting standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines we announce, or at all, could hav e the same negativ e impacts, as well as expose us to gov ernment enforcement actions, fines and priv ate litigation. Ev en if we achiev e our goals, targets and objectiv es, we may not realize all of the benefits that we expected at the time they were established.\n\n## Climate change might adversely impact our supply chain or our operations.\n\nScientific ev idence collected by the Intergov ernmental Panel on Climate Change demonstrates that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and will in the future cause changes in weather patterns around the globe that expose us to physical and transition risk. Physical  risks  include  the  increasing  frequency  of  extreme  weather  ev ents  and  natural  disasters  and  effects  on  water  av ailability  and  quality  and biodiv ersity loss. T hese impacts increase risks to the global food production and distribution system and to the safety and resilience of the communities where  we  liv e,  work  and  source  our  ingredients,  and  could  further  decrease  food  security  for  communities  around  the  world.  Decreased  agricultural productiv ity caused by climate change has limited and in the future may continue to limit the av ailability of the commodities we purchase and use and increase the costs of such products. These include cocoa, which is a critical raw material for our chocolate and biscuits &amp; baked snacks portfolios that is particularly sensitiv e to changes in climate and has recently had a global decrease in av ailability and increase in price, as well as other raw materials such as dairy, wheat, v egetable oils, sugar and nuts. Weather ev ents such as floods, sev ere storms or water shortages that are partially caused or exacerbated by climate change might disrupt our business operations or those of our suppliers, their suppliers, our external manufacturing partners, distributors or other business partners and could increase our insurance and other operating costs.\n\nTransition risks include increased focus by federal, state and local regulatory and legislativ e bodies globally regarding env ironmental policies relating to climate  change,  regulating  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (including  carbon  pricing  or  a  carbon  tax),  energy  policies,  disclosure  obligations  and sustainability (including single use plastics). New legal and regulatory requirements hav e increased and could continue to increase our operating costs for things like energy or packaging through taxes or regulations, including payments under extended producer responsibility policies, taxes on specific packaging material types and targets to increase the use of reuse/refill deliv ery models. Regulations intended to reduce carbon emissions, including any actual or proposed carbon taxes, could also substantially increase our product supply chain and distribution costs. Ev en if we make changes to align ourselv es with such legal or regulatory requirements, we may still be subject to significant penalties or potential litigation if such laws and regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices. Similarly, we may incur substantial costs if such legal or regulatory requirements are subsequently  rev ersed  or  modified.  Concern  about  climate  change  might  cause  consumer  preferences  to  switch  away  from  products  or  ingredients considered to hav e high climate change impact and towards products that are more sustainably grown and made. We expect to incur additional costs as we evolv e our portfolio and engage in due diligence, v erification and reporting in connection with our ESG and sustainability initiativ es. We might not effectiv ely  address  increased  attention  from  the  media,  shareholders,  activ ists  and  other  stakeholders  on  climate  change  and  related  env ironmental sustainability matters, including deforestation, land use, water use and packaging, including plastic. Those stakeholders might also hav e requests or proposals that are not aligned with the focus of our efforts on climate change and  ESG matters.  Climate change-related impacts could also reduce demand for our products. If costs for raw materials increase or av ailability decreases, we raise prices for our products and our competitors respond differently to those",

We also sell products directly to businesses and consumers through v arious pure play e-retail platforms, retailer digital platforms, our direct-to-consumer websites and social media platforms. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net rev enues from continuing operations in 2024. For a discussion of long-term demographics, consumer trends and demand, refer to our Financial Outlook within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .\n\n## Distribution and Marketing\n\nOur  product  distribution  network  encompasses  direct  store  deliv ery,  company-owned  and  satellite  warehouses,  distribution  centers,  third  party distributors and other facilities. Additionally, we lev erage the serv ices of independent sales offices and agents in v arious international locations. T hrough our global digital commerce organization and capabilities, we pursue online growth with partners in key markets around the world, including both pure etailers and omni-channel retailers. We continue to inv est in adv ertising and consumer promotions, talent and digital capabilities. Our digital commerce channel strategies play a critical role in our ambition to be the global leader in snacking.\n\nOur marketing initiativ es are categorized in three principal sets of activ ities: (i) consumer marketing and adv ertising including digital and social media, onair , print, outdoor and other product promotions; (ii) consumer sales incentiv es such as coupons and rebates; and (iii) trade promotions to support price features, displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers.\n\n## Research, Development and Innovation\n\nOur  innov ation  and  new  product  dev elopment  objectiv es  include  continuous  improv ement  in  food  safety  and  quality,  growth  through  new  products, superior  consumer satisfaction  and  reduced  production  costs.  We  hav e  established  a  robust  framework  for  innov ation  to  driv e  a  technology  pipeline supporting the creation of new product bundles across short-, medium- and long-term horizons. These bundles enhance our portfolio to address ev olv ing consumer preferences and market trends, nutritional  needs  as  well  as  reduce  our  env ironmental  impact.  We  work  to  test  and  learn  new  ideas  and implement successful ones into other areas of our business. T o driv e growth, creativ ity, greater effectiv eness, improv ed efficiency and accelerated project deliv ery, we are focusing our technical research and dev elopment resources at technical centers around the globe.\n\nMindful snacking and sustainability are a significant focus of our current research and dev elopment initiativ es.

Some competitors have different profit objectiv es and inv estment time horizons than we do and therefore may approach pricing and promotional decisions differently.  We compete based on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, serv ice, product innov ation, taste, conv enience, nutritional v alue, the ability  to  identify  and  satisfy  consumer  preferences,  effectiv eness  of  our  digital  and  other  sales  and  marketing  strategies,  routes  to  market  and distribution  networks,  promotional  activ ities  and  price.  Our  adv antaged  global  footprint,  operating  scale  and  portfolio  of  brands  hav e  all  significantly contributed to building our market-leading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell.

Tradem arks rem ain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our tradem arks. W e have authorized, through licensing arrangem ents, the use of m any of our tradem arks in such contexts as convenient food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointm ents. In addition, we license the use of our tradem arks on m erchandise that i s sol d at retai l , whi ch enhances brand awareness.\n\nWe either own or have licenses to use a num ber of patents which relate to certain of  our  products,  their  packaging,  the  processes  for  their production and the design and operation of various equipm ent used in our businesses. Som e of these patents are licensed to others.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur businesses are affected by seasonal variations.  Our beverage and convenient food sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter.  However, taken as a whole, seasonality has not had a m aterial i m pact on our consolidated financial results.\n\n## Our Customers\n\nOur customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice custom ers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, m ass m erchandisers, m em bership stores, hard discounters, e-com m erce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, am ong others. W e normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and m anufacture certain beverage products bearing our tradem arks within a specific geographic area. These arrangem ents provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the m anufacturing process required for product quality . W e also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our tradem arks for specified geographic areas.\n\nWe rely on and provide financial incentives to our custom ers to assist in the distribution and prom otion of our products to the consum er. For our i n dependent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volum e-based rebates, product placem ent fees, prom otions and displays. For our i n dependent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipm ent placem ent. Consumer  incentives  include  pricing  discounts  and  prom otions,  and  other  prom otional  offers.  Advertising  support  is  directed  at  advertising programs  and  supporting  independent  bottler  m edia.  New  product  support  includes  targeted  consum er  and  retailer  incentives  and  direct marketplace  support,  such  as  point-of-purchase  m aterials,  product  placem ent  fees,  m edia  and  advertising.  V ending  and  cooler  equipm ent placement programs support the acquisition and placem ent of vending m achines and cooler equipm ent. The nature and type of program s vary annually.\n\nChanges to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the continued growth of sales through e-com m erce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services and other direct-to-consum er businesses, the integration of physical and digital operations am ong retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard discounters, and the current econom ic environm ent continue to i n crease  the  i m portance  of  m ajor  custom ers.  In  2024,  sales  to  W alm art  Inc.

          "chunk_text": "and data systems or those of our suppliers, cybersecurity incidents including but not limited to ransomware attacks, misuse of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials (including water, recycled materials and materials that meet our labor standards), significant changes in trade policy, natural disasters, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise, acts of war or terrorism, disease outbreaks or other external factors over which we have no control, have at times interrupted and could, in the future, interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## Our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results.\n\nOur costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities (including certain petroleum-derived materials like resins and paperbased materials like pulp) and raw and packaging materials and the costs of labor, transportation (including trucks and containers), energy, pension and healthcare. Inflation pressures sometimes result in increases in these input costs. Therefore, our business results depend, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations and to anticipate consumer reaction to our management of these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels.\n\nThe consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining sales and profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry into certain categories and growth in hard discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile or social commerce applications, could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to  successfully  manage  relationships  with  our  retail  trade  customers,  which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of increased offerings of other branded manufacturers, private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption.\n\n## If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success directly depends on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results of operations or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if the Company or one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients, negative perceptions of packaging (such as plastic and other petroleum-based materials), lack of recyclability  or  other  environmental  attributes,  concerns  about  actual  or  alleged  labor  or  equality  and  inclusion  practices,  privacy  failures  or  data  breaches, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted, and our results of operations or cash flows could suffer. Our Company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion and environmental sustainability.

TGT states that weather conditions are a risk factor that could disrupt its global supply chain, increase costs, and adversely affect its results of operations.

TGT reports specific PSU activity, including a grant of 753 units with a grant date fair value of $164.92 per unit, and tracks nonvested units and their fair value over time. WMT issues PSUs under the Walmart Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015, which has registered 780 million shares for issuance across various equity awards, including PSUs.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nRevenues are recorded net of trade and sales incentiv es and estimated product returns. Known or expected pricing or rev enue adjustments, such as trade discounts, rebates or returns, are estimated at the time of sale. We base these estimates of expected amounts principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. Estimates that affect rev enue, such as trade incentiv es and product returns, are monitored and adjusted each period until the incentiv es or product returns are realized.\n\nKey  sales  terms,  such  as  pricing  and  quantities  ordered,  are  established  on  a  frequent  basis  such  that  most  customer  arrangements  and  related incentiv es  hav e  a  one  year  or  shorter  duration. As  such,  we  do  not  capitalize  contract  inception  costs  and  we  capitalize  product  fulfillment  costs. Deferred rev enues are not material and primarily include customer adv ance payments typically collected a few days before product deliv ery, at which time deferred rev enues are reclassified and recorded as net rev enues. We generally do not receiv e non-cash consideration for the sale of goods nor do we grant payment financing terms greater than one year.\n\n## Marketing, Advertising and Research and Development\n\nWe promote our products with marketing and advertising programs.  These programs include, but are not limited to, cooperativ e adv ertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. For interim reporting purposes, adv ertising, consumer promotion and marketing research expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of v olume, based on estimated sales v olume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheets and all marketing and adv ertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred. Adv ertising expense was $2,112 million in 2024, $2,057 million in 2023 and $1,670 million in 2022. We expense product research and dev elopment costs as incurred. Research and development expense was $400 million in 2024, $380 million in 2023 and $346 million in 2022. We record marketing and adv ertising as well as research and dev elopment expenses within selling, general and administrativ e expenses.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain a share-based compensation plan, which authorizes the granting of v arious  equity-based  incentiv es,  including  stock  options  (including stock appreciation rights), deferred stock units (DSUs) and performance share units (PSUs). Stock compensation expense is amortized to expense ov er the v esting period, generally three years.\n\nStock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our Common Stock on the grant date. Substantially all of the options become exercisable in three annual installments beginning a year from the grant date and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes Model to measure the fair v alue of stock options granted to employees. The expected life of the options represents the period of time the  options  are  expected  to  be  outstanding  and  is  based  on  historical  trends.  Expected  stock  price  v olatility  is  based  on  the  implied  and  historical volatility of the Company's stock. T he expected div idend yield is based on the Company's most recent annual div idend rate. T he risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curv e in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life.\n\nDSUs are typically granted to selected management employees on an annual basis and v est ov er three years. Div idend equiv alents are paid during the vesting period for DSUs granted prior to February 27, 2024. For DSUs granted on or after February 27, 2024, div idend equiv alents accumulated ov er the vesting period are paid after v esting. T he fair v alue of our DSUs and other stock-based awards is measured at the market price of our Common Stock on the grant date.\n\nPSUs vest based on varying performance, market and serv ice conditions. Div idend equiv alents accumulated ov er the v esting period are paid after v esting. The grant date fair v alue of PSUs is determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation model for the market-based component and the market price of our Common  Stock  on  the  grant  date  for  performance-based  components.  The  final  award  may  equal 0-200  percent  of  the  target  grant,  based  on  the achiev ement of the performance and market-based components .\n\nForfeitures are estimated on the grant date for all of our stock-based compensation awards.\n\n## Employee Benefit Plans\n\nWe provide a range of benefits to our current and retired employees including pension benefits, defined contribution plan benefits, postretirement health care  benefits  and  postemployment  primarily  sev erance-related  benefits  depending  upon  local  statutory  requirements,  employee  tenure  and  serv ice requirements as well as other factors. The cost for these plans is recognized in earnings primarily ov er the working life of the cov ered employee.",

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola (KO), Altria (MO), and Philip Morris (PM) each disclose their use of swaps and related risk management strategies, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to managing exposure to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) uses swaps as part of a broader suite of derivative instruments to hedge against foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk, and interest rate risk, with derivatives carried at fair value and detailed documentation of hedging strategies and effectiveness. Altria (MO) also employs swaps, forward contracts, and options to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk, with a focus on hedge accounting and formal documentation of risk management objectives. Philip Morris (PM) takes a more quantitative approach, using value at risk (VaR) modeling to estimate potential losses in the fair value of swaps, forwards, and options, specifically tied to interest rate and foreign currency price sensitivity. While all three companies use swaps, KO emphasizes comprehensive documentation and effectiveness testing, MO focuses on alignment with hedge accounting rules, and PM applies statistical modeling to assess derivative risk exposure.",

The Company elected to invest a majority of its solvency capital in a portfolio of marketable equity and debt securities. These securities are included in the disclosures above. The Company uses one of our consolidated captive insurance companies to reinsure group annuity insurance contracts that cover the obligations of certain of our European and Canadian pension plans. This captive's solvency capital funds included total equity and debt securities of $1,883 million and $1,643 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were classified in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets because the assets were not available to satisfy our current obligations.\n\n## NOTE 5: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company's financial performance and are referred to as 'market risks.' When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\n\nThe Company uses various types of derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative returns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect ex pected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes) a call option, or alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-derivative instruments, such as our foreign currency denominated third-party debt, in hedging relationships.\n\nAll derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid ex penses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with the same counterparty.\n\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our consolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the values of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings.\n\nFor derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures.\n\nThe Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to Note 17. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency ex change rates, commodity rates or other financial indices. The Company does not view the fair",

We included expanded footnote disclosures as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2023-07 in Note 17. Segment Reporting . We will include interim disclosure requirements in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements beginning in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n## Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. We record cash equivalents at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.\n- Depreciation, Amortization and Impairment Testing: We record property, plant and equipment at historical costs and depreciate by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate machinery and equipment over periods up to 20 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years. We amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years.\n\nWe review long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If we determine that an impairment ex ists, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. We base impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. We also review the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.\n\nWe conduct a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment as of October 1 of each year, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require us to perform an interim review. We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If necessary, we will perform a single step quantitative impairment test. Additionally, we have the option to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, goodwill is considered impaired. We measure the amount of impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a reporting unit; however, the amount of the impairment loss is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset ex ceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, we consider the intangible asset impaired and reduce the carrying value to fair value in the period identified.\n\n- Derivative Financial Instruments: From time to time, we enter into derivatives to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks, including foreign currency exchange rate risk. We use various types of derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, options and swaps.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities. We designate derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges at the inception of the contracts. For fair value hedges, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative, as well as the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item, in the consolidated statements of earnings each period. For cash flow hedges, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative each period in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) and reclassify changes to the consolidated statements of earnings in the same periods in which operating results are affected by the respective hedged item. For net investment hedges, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign currency transaction gains or losses on a nonderivative hedging instrument in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. Such amounts remain in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the underlying foreign operations occurs for investments in foreign entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We classify cash flows from hedging instruments in the same manner as the respective hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, is expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated. We formally designate and document, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective, the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction and method for assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions, if it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, we would no longer consider the hedge effective and would record all of the derivative gains and losses in the consolidated statement of earnings in the current period.\n\nFor financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments or do not qualify for hedge accounting, we record changes in fair value in the consolidated statement of earnings each period. We do not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.",

Anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the computation.\n\nThe computation estimates were made assuming normal market conditions, using a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period using a \"parametric deltagamma\" approximation technique to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies and in calculating the risk of the underlying positions in the portfolio. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements primarily over the preceding quarter for determining value at risk at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and primarily over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average, high and low value at risk amounts during each year.\n\n",

      "question": "How do Colgate-Palmolive (CL), The Coca-Cola Company (KO), and Target Corporation (TGT) each assess the impact of labor unrest on their respective supply chains and workforce operations, and what do their disclosures reveal about the varying degrees of vulnerability across the consumer staples sector?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) highlights that labor unrest is a global risk due to its extensive international operations, particularly in markets where geopolitical instability and social unrest could disrupt operations and reduce consumer confidence. Coca-Cola (KO) specifically notes that labor unrest could impact its bottling operations and supply chain, especially given the unionized workforce in key manufacturing and bottling plants, which could impair its ability to supply products to customers. Target (TGT) emphasizes that labor unrest, along with other supply chain disruptions like port delays and vendor delivery issues, could materially affect inventory availability and increase costs, especially given its reliance on international sourcing and third-party logistics. When combined, these perspectives show that while all three companies are exposed to labor-related risks, the nature and operational implications differ: CL faces broad macro-social risks, KO is exposed through its labor-intensive bottling network, and TGT is vulnerable through its complex global supply chain and vendor dependencies.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS\n\nIn addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report, set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities. These risks, some of which have occurred and/or are occurring and any of which could occur in the future, are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.\n\n## Business and Industry Risks\n\n## We face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nWe operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately 70% of our Net sales originating in markets outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we face risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:\n\n- changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of inflation, volatile commodity prices and increases in the cost of raw and packaging materials, labor, energy and logistics;\n- political or economic instability, geopolitical events, environmental events, widespread health emergencies, such as COVID19 or other pandemics or epidemics, natural disasters or social or labor unrest;\n- changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows from non-U.S. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars, in those markets;\n- exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import or export raw materials or finished product, including as a result of COVID-19, or to repatriate earnings from overseas;\n- lack of well-established, reliable and/or impartial legal systems in certain countries where we operate and difficulties in enforcing contractual, intellectual property or other legal rights;\n- foreign ownership and investment restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources; and\n- changes to trade policies and agreements and other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of and/or the increase in onerous trade restrictions and/or tariffs, sanctions, price controls, labor laws, travel or immigration restrictions, including as a result of COVID-19 or other pandemics or epidemics, profit controls or other government controls.\n\nAny or all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings.\n\nIn addition, there continue to be uncertainties related to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union ('EU') (commonly referred to as Brexit), including the long-term impact of the bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU (the 'EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement'). These uncertainties include the impact of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on businesses in the EU and the United Kingdom and how the new relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom will develop over time, including disruptions to trade and the free movement of goods, services and people to and from the United Kingdom, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the British pound and/or the euro and disruptions to our workforce and that of",

          "chunk_text": "partners are subject to similar risks as we are relating to cybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems and employee failures, and are subject to legal, regulatory and market risks of their own. Our third-party service providers and business partners may not fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreedupon terms. In addition, while we have procedures in place for selecting and managing our relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, or for any reason our third-party service providers or business partners fail to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, our financial results could suffer.\n\n## If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or if we or our bottling partners experience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our business could suffer.\n\nMany of our employees at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we generally have been able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and regard our relations with employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory, negotiations may nevertheless be challenging, as the Company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our employees. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which could affect our profit margins. In addition, many of our bottling partners' employees are represented by labor unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or at our bottling operations or our major bottlers' plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers' ability to supply finished beverages to customers, which could reduce our net operating revenues and could expose us to customer claims. Furthermore, from time to time we and our bottling partners restructure manufacturing and other operations to improve productivity, which may have negative impacts on employee morale and work performance, result in escalation of grievances and adversely affect the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements. If these labor relations are not effectively managed at the local level, they could escalate in the form of corporate campaigns supported by the labor organizations and could negatively affect our Company's overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products' acceptance by consumers.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS\n\n## Obesity and other health-related concerns may reduce demand for some of our products.\n\nThere is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about the health problems associated with obesity. Increasing public concern about obesity; other health-related public concerns surrounding consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages; possible new or increased taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages by government entities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue; additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our sugar-sweetened beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sugar-sweetened beverages may reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, our sugar-sweetened beverages, which could adversely affect our profitability.\n\n## If we do not address evolving consumer product and shopping preferences, our business could suffer.\n\nConsumer product preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sugar-sweetened beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients; shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer tastes and needs coupled with a rapid expansion of beverage options and delivery methods; changes in consumer lifestyles; concerns regarding location of origin or source of ingredients and raw materials and the environmental, social and sustainability impact of ingredient sources and the product manufacturing process; consumer emphasis on transparency related to ingredients we use in our products and collection and recyclability of, and amount of recycled content contained in, our packaging containers and other materials; concerns about the health and welfare of animals in our dairy supply chain; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, in many of our markets, shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with consumers rapidly embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms. If we fail to address changes in consumer product and shopping preferences, do not successfully anticipate and prepare for future changes in such preferences, or are ineffective or slow in developing and implementing appropriate digital transformation initiatives, our share of sales, revenue growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.\n\n## Product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.\n\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards, which we expect our operations as well as our bottling partners to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our bottling partners periodically have not met, and may not always meet, these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions into beverage categories, such as value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, that are beyond our",

As we continue to add capabilities to quickly move the appropriate amount of inventory at optimal operational costs through our supply chain, operating our replenishment and fulfillment network becomes more complex and challenging. If our replenishment and fulfillment network does not operate properly, if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, or if common carriers have difficulty providing capacity to meet demands for their services like they experienced at times during 2020 and 2021, we could experience merchandise  out-of-stocks,  delivery  delays  or  increased  delivery  costs,  which  could  lead  to  lost  sales  and  decreased  guest confidence, and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nA large portion of our merchandise is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the U.S., with China as our single largest source. Any major changes in tax or trade policy, such as the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products, between the U.S. and countries from which we source merchandise could require us to take certain actions, including for example raising prices on products we sell and seeking alternative sources of supply from vendors in other countries with whom we have less familiarity, which could adversely affect our reputation, sales, and our results of operations.\n\nPolitical  or  financial  instability,  currency  fluctuations,  the  outbreak  of  pandemics  or  other  illnesses  (such  as  the  COVID-19 pandemic),  labor  shortages,  labor  unrest  and  activism,  transport  capacity  and  costs,  inflation,  port  security,  weather  conditions, natural disasters, armed conflicts, or other events that could alter or suspend our operations, slow or disrupt port activities, or affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could materially disrupt our supply of merchandise, increase our costs, and/or adversely affect our results of operations. There have been periodic closings and ship diversions, labor disputes, and congestion disrupting U.S. ports, including those in California where we receive a significant portion of the products we source from outside the U.S. In addition, some vendors have had difficulty supplying us products in the quantities we seek. The combination of port disruptions, the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events in our supply chain have caused us to make alternative arrangements to continue the flow of inventory, and if these types of events recur, worsen, or occur in other countries through which we source products, it may have a material impact on our costs or inventory supply. Changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nIf  services  we  obtain  from  third  parties  are  unavailable,  disrupted,  or  fail  to  meet  our  standards  and  expectations,  our operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely on third parties to support our business, including portions of our technology infrastructure, development, and support; our digital  platforms;  our  replenishment  and  fulfillment  operations;  store  and  supply  chain  infrastructure  construction  and  remodel program; credit and debit card transaction processing; extensions of credit for our RedCard program; infrastructure supporting our guest contact centers; aspects of our food offerings; and delivery services. If we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business, or if they fail to meet our performance standards and expectations, then our reputation and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nTARGET CORPORATION\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n10",

      "question": "How do Costco, Sam's Club, and Walmart each approach private label merchandise expansion and what does this reveal about their differing strategies for driving member value and competitive differentiation in core product categories?",
      "answer": "Costco emphasizes expanding its private-label items as part of its merchandising strategy to maintain 'pricing authority' and deliver competitive values, directly tying this to its ability to absorb cost increases and pass savings to members. Sam's Club specifically highlights its Member's Mark private label brand as a key differentiator that 'continues to expand its assortment and deliver member value,' positioning it as central to its competitive positioning against other warehouse clubs like Costco. Walmart notes that its private label brands are part of a broader strategy across its retail segments, though it does not quantify the expansion specifically for Sam's Club, suggesting a more integrated but less explicitly focused approach on private label as a standalone competitive lever compared to Costco and Sam's Club. When synthesized, this reveals that while all three retailers utilize private label merchandise, Costco and Sam's Club treat it as a core strategic differentiator for member value, whereas Walmart appears to take a more general retail approach without emphasizing it as strongly in its warehouse club segment.",

Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits\n\n## Retirement Plans\n\nThe Company and certain of its U.S. and foreign subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans. Benefits under these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' earnings.\n\nIn the U.S., effective January 1, 2014, the Company provides virtually all future retirement benefits through the Company's defined contribution plan. As a result, service after December 31, 2013 is not considered for participants in the Company's principal U.S. defined benefit retirement plan. Participants in the Company's principal U.S. defined benefit retirement plan whose retirement benefit was determined under the cash balance formula continue to earn interest credits on their vested balances as of December 31, 2013 but no longer receive pay credits. Participants whose retirement benefit was determined under the final average earnings formula or career average earnings formula continue to have their accrued benefit adjusted for pay increases until termination of employment.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a charge of $267 as a result of a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the 'Second Circuit') affirming a grant of summary judgment to the plaintiffs in a lawsuit under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act seeking the recalculation of benefits and other relief associated with a 2005 residual annuity amendment to the Colgate-Palmolive Company Employees' Retirement Income Plan (the 'Retirement Plan'). The decision resulted in an increase in the obligations of the Retirement Plan, which based on the current funded status of the Retirement Plan and depending on further developments in the litigation, may require a cash contribution by the Company in 2025. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.\n\n## COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Dollars in Millions Ex cept Share and Per Share Amounts)",

These programs are ev idenced by agreements that are reflected in  the  carrying  v alue  of  the  inv entory  when  earned  or  as  the  Company  progresses  towards  earning  the  rebate  or  discount,  and  as  a  component  of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other v endor consideration is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, agreement terms or another systematic approach.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrativ e expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers' compensation costs for warehouse employees (other than  fresh  foods  departments  and  certain  ancillary  businesses,  which  are  reflected  in  merchandise  costs)  as  well  as  all  regional  and  home  office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrativ e expenses also include substantially all building and equipment depreciation, stock  compensation  expense,  credit  and  debit  card  processing  fees,  utilities,  preopening,  as  well  as  other  operating  costs  incurred  to  support warehouse and e-commerce operations.\n\n## Retirement Plans\n\nThe Company's 401(k) retirement plan is av ailable to all U.S. employees ov er the age of 18 who hav e completed 90 days of employment. The plan allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company prov ides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution. T he Company also has a defined contribution plan for employees in Canada and contributes a percentage of each employee's wages. Certain subsidiaries in the Company's Other International operations hav e defined benefit and defined contribution plans, which are immaterial. Amounts expensed under all plans were $963, $914, and $824 for 2024, 2023, and 2022, and are predominantly included in SG&amp;A expenses in the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe  Company  grants  stock-based  compensation,  primarily  to  employees  and  non-employee  directors.  Grants  to  executiv e  officers  are  generally performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approv als, there hav e been amended and restated plans and new prov isions implemented by the Company. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally v est ov er fiv e years and three years and are subject to quarterly v esting in the ev ent of retirement or v oluntary termination. Employees who attain at least 25 years of serv ice with the Company and non-employee directors with fiv e or more years receiv e shares under accelerated v esting prov isions. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\n\nCompensation expense for awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method ov er the requisite serv ice period for the entire award. The terms of the RSUs, including performance-based awards, prov ide for accelerated v esting for employees and non-employee directors. Recipients are not entitled  to  v ote  or  receiv e  div idends  on  unv ested  and  undeliv ered  shares.  Compensation  expense  for  the  accelerated  shares  is  recognized  upon achiev ement of the long-serv ice term. T he cumulativ e amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair  v alue  of  the  award  that  is  v ested  at  that  date.  T he  fair  v alue  of  RSUs  is  calculated  as  the  market  v alue  of  the  common  stock  on  the measurement date less the present v alue of the expected div idends forgone during the v esting period.\n\nStock-based  compensation  expense  is  predominantly  included  in  SG&amp;A  expenses  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income.

Defined Contribution Plans\n\nT eam members who meet eligibility requirements can participate in a defined contribution 401(k) plan by inv esting up to 80 percent of their eligible earnings, as  limited  by  statute  or  regulation.  We  match 100  percent  of  each  team  member's  contribution  up  to 5  percent  of  eligible  earnings.  Company  match contributions are made to funds designated by the participant, none of which are based on Target common stock.\n\nIn  addition,  we  maintain  an  unfunded,  nonqualified  deferred  compensation plan for a broad management group whose participation in our 401(k) plan is limited by statute or regulation.  T hese team members choose from a menu of crediting rate alternativ es that are generally the same as the inv estment choices in our 401(k) plan, but also includes a fund based on T arget common stock. We credit an additional 2 percent per year to the accounts of all activ e participants, excluding executiv e officers, in part to recognize the risks inherent to their participation in this plan. We also maintain a frozen, unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan cov ering less than 50 participants. Our total liability under these plans was $684 million and $627 million as of February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, respectiv ely.\n\nWe mitigate our risk of offering the nonqualified plans through inv esting in company-owned life insurance and prepaid forward contracts that substantially offset our economic exposure to the returns of these plans. These inv estments are general corporate assets and are marked to market with the related gains and losses recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period they occur.\n\n",

Target accounts for the vast majority of its inventory using the LIFO method under the retail inventory method, with inventory valued at $12.7 billion as of February 1, 2025. Comparing these approaches reveals that while all three companies utilize LIFO, the extent and implications of its application vary significantly, with MO relying most heavily on LIFO, CL using it selectively, and TGT applying it broadly across its inventory base.",

          "chunk_text": "## COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Dollars in Millions Ex cept Share and Per Share Amounts)\n\n## Shipping and Handling Costs\n\nShipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) are classified as Selling, general and administrative ex penses and were $1,777, $1,771 and $1,874 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Marketing Costs\n\nThe Company markets its products through advertising and other promotional activities. Advertising costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred. Certain consumer and trade promotional programs, such as consumer coupons, are recorded as a reduction of sales.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe cost of approximately 75% of inventories is determined using the FIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of the remaining inventories, in the U.S. and Mexico, is determined using the LIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories in excess of one year of forecasted sales are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent 'Other assets.'\n\n## Property, Plant and E quipment\n\nLand, buildings and machinery and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided, primarily using the straight-line method, over the estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings. Depreciation attributable to manufacturing operations is included in Cost of sales. The remaining component of depreciation is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangibles\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the Company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. In assessing impairment, the Company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis.\n\nDetermining the fair value of the Company's reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. When a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates and the selection of royalty rates and discount rates. The Company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.\n\nAs a result of a reporting structure realignment, the Company reallocated the goodwill of a certain reporting unit from the Europe segment to the North America segment. Before and after the reporting structure realignment, the Company completed an assessment indicating no goodwill impairment was required. Refer to Note 13, Segment Information for additional information.\n\nOther intangible assets with finite lives, such as local brands and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 40 years. Amortization expense related to intangible assets is included in Other (income) expense, net, which is included in Operating profit.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- Employee Benefit Plans: We provide a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, mortality, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates.\n\nWe recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets and record as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost (income). We subsequently amortize the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) into net periodic benefit cost (income) in future years.\n\n- Fair Value Measurements: We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the ex change price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an ex it price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We use a fair value hierarchy, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are:\n\nLevel 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\n- Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n\n- Guarantees: We recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities. See Note 20 . Contingencies - Guarantees and Other Similar Matters for a further discussion of guarantees.\n- Income Taxes: Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.\n\nWe determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax  rates in effect for the year in which the differences are ex pected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. We determine the realizability of deferred tax  assets based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence. In reaching this determination, we consider the character of the assets and the possible sources of taxable income of the appropriate character within the available carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law.\n\nWe recognize the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions in our consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon ex amination by tax ing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For those income tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax  benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n- Inventories: We use the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method to determine the cost of the majority of our inventories. We determine the cost of the remaining inventories using the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') and average cost methods. We record inventories that are measured using the LIFO method at the lower of cost or market. We state inventories that are measured using the FIFO and average cost methods at the lower of cost and net realizable value. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventories as a current asset although part of such inventories, because of the duration of the curing and aging process, ordinarily would not be used within one year. We determined the cost of approximately 77% and 76% of our inventories at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, using the LIFO method. The recorded LIFO amounts of our inventories were approximately $0.7 billion lower than the current cost of our inventories at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n- Investments in E quity Securities: Investments in equity securities in which we have the ability to ex ercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or the fair value option. The election of the fair value option is irrevocable and is made on an investment by investment basis.\n\nWe elected to account for our investments in ABI and Cronos under the equity method of accounting. Our share of equity (income) losses and other adjustments associated with these investments are included in (income) losses from investments in equity securities in our consolidated statements of earnings. We report the carrying value for each of our investments in ABI and Cronos in investments in equity securities on our consolidated balance sheets. We report equity method investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting at cost and adjust these investments each period for our share of (income) losses and dividends paid, if any. We report our share of ABI's and Cronos's results using a one-quarter lag because results are not available in time for us to record them in the concurrent period. At the end of each reporting period, we review our investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value.

          "chunk_text": "Inventory and cost of sales: The v ast majority of our inv entory is accounted for under the retail inv entory accounting method using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO). Our inv entory is v alued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. We reduce inv entory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses and is adjusted to reflect results of actual physical inv entory counts. We generally perform counts at each location annually, with counts taking place throughout the year. A 10 percent increase or decrease in our 2024 year-end inv entory shrink reserv e would impact our cost of sales by approximately $150 million. Historically, our actual physical inv entory count results hav e shown our estimates to be reasonably accurate. Market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Salability can be impacted by consumer preferences and seasonality, among other factors. We believ e the risk of inv entory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inv entory typically turns in less than three months. Inv entory was $12.7 billion and $1 1.9 billion as of February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, respectiv ely, and is further described in Note 8 to the Financial Statements.\n\nVendor income: We receiv e v arious forms of consideration from our v endors (v endor income), principally earned as a result of v olume rebates, promotions, advertising allowances, and markdown allowances. Vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales except in arrangements where the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs and recorded as an offset to those costs.  Vendor income earned can v ary based on a number of factors, including purchase v olumes, sales v olumes, and our pricing and promotion strategies.\n\nWe establish a receiv able for v endor income that is earned but not yet receiv ed. Based on historical trending and data, this receiv able is computed by forecasting v endor income collections and estimating the amount earned. The majority of the year-end v endor income receiv ables are collected within the following  fiscal  quarter ,  and  we  do  not  believ e  there  is  a  reasonable  likelihood  that  the  assumptions  used  in  our  estimate  will  change  significantly. Historically,  adjustments  to  our  v endor  income  receiv able  hav e  not  been  material.  Vendor  income  receiv able  was  $543  million  and  $513  million  as  of February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, respectiv ely. Vendor income is described further in Note 4 to the Financial Statements.\n\nLong-lived assets: Long-liv ed assets are rev iewed for impairment whenev er ev ents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recov erable. T he ev aluation is performed primarily at the store lev el. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or ev entual disposition of the asset or asset group are less than its carrying amount, and is measured as the excess of its carrying amount ov er fair v alue. We estimate fair v alue by obtaining market appraisals, obtaining v aluations from third-party brokers, or using other v aluation techniques. We recorded impairments of $68 million, $102 million, and $66 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectiv ely, which are described further in Note 10 to the Financial Statements.\n\nInsurance/self-insurance: We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss cov erage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of their net present v alue; other  liabilities  referred  to  abov e  are  not  discounted.  Our  workers'  compensation  and  general  liability  accrual  was  $772  million  and  $650  million  as  of February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, respectiv ely. We believ e that the amounts accrued are appropriate; howev er, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss dev elopments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 10 percent increase or decrease in av erage claim costs would have impacted our self-insurance expense by $77 million in 2024. Historically, adjustments to our estimates hav e not been material. Refer to Part II, Item  7A,  Quantitativ e  and  Qualitativ e  Disclosures About  Market  Risk,  for  further  disclosure  of  the  market  risks  associated  with  these  exposures.  We maintain insurance cov erage to limit our exposure to certain ev ents, including network security matters.\n\n2024 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How do Colgate-Palmolive (CL), Costco (COST), and Altria (MO) each apply the FIFO inventory valuation method, and what does this reveal about their inventory management strategies and regional operations?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) applies the FIFO method to approximately 75% of its inventories, with the remainder valued under LIFO, primarily in the U.S. and Mexico. Costco (COST) uses FIFO for Canadian and international merchandise inventories, while U.S. inventories are valued under LIFO. Altria (MO) applies FIFO and average cost methods to a minority of its inventories, with the majority under LIFO. These differences reflect varied regional operations and inventory turnover dynamics, with FIFO usage concentrated outside the U.S. for COST and selectively across global operations for CL, while MO relies more heavily on LIFO for most of its inventory valuation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CL \u2192 FIFO Method: CL uses FIFO for ~75% of inventories and LIFO for the remainder in the U.S. and Mexico, indicating a global FIFO strategy with localized LIFO application.",
        "Hop 2: COST \u2192 FIFO Method: COST uses FIFO for Canadian and international merchandise inventories, contrasting with LIFO for U.S. inventories, showing FIFO is applied where inflationary impacts are less pronounced.",
        "Hop 3: MO \u2192 FIFO Method: MO uses FIFO and average cost for a minority of inventories, with ~76% valued under LIFO as of 2023, showing FIFO is a supplementary method in its inventory valuation approach."

Mondel\u0113z explicitly states it has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines and a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Non-Employee Directors, and makes these documents publicly accessible on its website. Altria discloses the existence of corporate governance guidelines and committee charters but does not provide detailed descriptions of internal control assessments or board independence standards beyond noting their availability online.

The financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include certain amounts based on our best judgments and estimates. Financial information in this report is consistent with that in the financial statements.\n\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control system is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a written Code of Business Conduct adopted by our Company's Board of Directors, applicable to all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries. In addition, our Company's Board of Directors adopted a written Code of Business Conduct for Non-Employee Directors which reflects the same principles and values as our Code of Business Conduct for officers and employees but focuses on matters of relevance to non-employee Directors.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and, even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ('Exchange Act'). Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) ('COSO') in Internal Control -Integrated Framework . Based on this assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Company's independent auditors, Ernst &amp; Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of our Company's Board of Directors, subject to ratification by our Company's shareowners. Ernst &amp; Young LLP has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries and the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the independent auditors are contained in this report.\n\n## Audit Committee's Responsibility\n\nThe Audit Committee of our Company's Board of Directors, composed solely of Directors who are independent in accordance with the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange listing standards, the Exchange Act, and the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, meets with the independent auditors, management and internal auditors periodically to discuss internal controls along with auditing and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent auditors the scope and results of the audit effort. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor without management present to ensure that the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor have free access to the Audit Committee. Our Audit Committee's Report can be found in the Company's 2022 Proxy Statement.",

          "chunk_text": "When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management performs a recoverability test of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models. These models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\n\nWe test indefinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models. These models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.\n\n## Pension Plan Valuations\n\nOur Company sponsors and/or contributes to pension plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. We also sponsor nonqualified, unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in the United States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans outside the United States.\n\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to the actuarial assumptions used to determine our net periodic pension cost or income and pension obligations. We believe the most critical assumptions are (1) the discount rate used to determine the present value of the liabilities and (2) the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, or more frequently to the extent that a settlement or curtailment occurs. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic pension cost or income and pension obligations.\n\nAt each measurement date, we determine the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high-quality, long-term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the future benefit payments we anticipate making under the plans.\n\nThe Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost or income by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Our investment objective for our pension assets is to ensure all funded pension plans have sufficient assets to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to seek to improve returns and manage risk.\n\nIn 2021, the Company's total income related to defined benefit pension plans was $61 million, which included net periodic pension income of $180 million and net charges of $119 million related to settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits. In 2022, we expect our net periodic pension income to be approximately $188 million. The increase in 2022 expected net periodic pension income is primarily due to an increase in the weighted-average discount rate at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, favorable asset performance in 2021 and a reduction in the number of plan participants arising from our strategic realignment initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in the expected weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption. The estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate would result in a $17 million decrease in our 2022 net periodic pension income. Additionally, the estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in a $26 million decrease in our 2022 net periodic pension income.\n\nThe sensitivity information provided above is based only on changes to the actuarial assumptions used for our U.S. pension plans. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's primary U.S. pension plan represented 61 percent and 57 percent of the Company's consolidated projected benefit obligation and pension plan assets, respectively. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions.",

We  believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable  and  comparable  to  those  that  would  be  used  by other marketplace participants. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic  events  and  circumstances  may  occur,  which could  affect  the  accuracy  or  validity  of  the  estimates  and assumptions.  For  example,  future  changes  in  the  judgments, assumptions  and  estimates  that  are  used  in  our  impairment testing  for  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. In addition, changes to or a failure to achieve business  plans  or  deterioration  of  macroeconomic  conditions could  result  in  reduced  cash  flows  or  higher  discount  rates, leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses.\n\nWe test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value.  Our  impairment  testing  for  goodwill  is  performed separately  from  our  impairment  testing  of  indefinite-lived intangible  assets.  If  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  or indefinite-lived  intangible  is  less  than  its  carrying  value,  that difference represents an impairment.\n\nDetermining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to  support  and  build  the  acquired  brands.  Other  acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, all customer relationships,  patents  and  technologies)  are  expected  to  have determinable  useful  lives.  Our  assessment  as  to  brands  that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number  of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment  of  the  countries  in  which  the  brands  are  sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over  their  estimated  lives.  An  impairment  assessment  for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\n\nMost  of  our  goodwill  reporting  units  are  comprised  of  a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have  fair  value  cushions  that,  at  a  minimum,  exceed  three times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting  units,  in  particular  Shave  Care  and Appliances,  are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high as our  legacy businesses. The Appliances reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value.\n\nBased  on  our  annual  impairment  testing  during  the  three months ended December 31, 2021, the Shave Care reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 30% and  the  Gillette  indefinite-lived  intangible  asset's  fair  value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5%.\n\nThe most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of  the  estimated  fair  values  of  the  Shave  Care  reporting  unit and  the  Gillette  indefinite-lived  intangible  asset  are  the  net sales  and  earnings  growth  rates  (including  residual  growth rates)  and  discount  rate.  The  residual  growth  rate  represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate is dependent on overall  market  growth  rates,  the  competitive  environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities  that  impact  market  share.  As  a  result,  the  residual growth  rate  could  be  adversely  impacted  by  a  sustained deceleration  in  category  growth,  grooming  habit  changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or  an increased  competitive  environment. The  discount  rate,  which is  consistent  with  a  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  that  is likely  to  be  expected  by  a  market  participant,  is  based  upon industry  required  rates  of  return,  including  consideration  of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount  rate  may  be  impacted  by  adverse  changes  in  the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets  or  other  country  specific  factors,  such  as  further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.  Another  key assumption  in  our  fair  value  determination  of  the  Gillette indefinite-lived  intangible  asset  is  the  royalty  rate,  which  is driven  by  historical  and  estimated  future  profitability  of  the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.\n\nWhile  management  can  and  has  implemented  strategies  to address these events in the past, changes in operating plans or adverse  changes  in  the  business  or  in  the  macroeconomic environment  in  the  future  could  reduce  the  underlying  cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in  fair  value  that  would  trigger  future  impairment  charges  of the  Shave  Care  reporting  unit's  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n\nThe  duration  and  severity  of  the  pandemic  and  the  RussiaUkraine  War  could  result  in  a  slow-down  or  a  recession  or drive inflationary pressures or foreign currency devaluations in the  general  economy.  These  could  trigger  additional  future impairment charges for the Shave Care reporting unit goodwill and  the  Gillette  indefinite-lived  intangible  asset.  While  we have concluded that a triggering event did not occur during the quarter  ended  June  30,  2022,  the  Gillette  indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk. Our assessment of the Gillette intangible asset assumes the net sales growth rates will continue to recover from the impact of the pandemic. There continues to be a high level of uncertainty relating to geopolitical and macroeconomic factors as a result of  the  Russia-Ukraine  War  and  the  COVID-19  pandemic. Accordingly, there",

This reveals differing inventory strategies: CL leans more heavily on FIFO for stability in cost recognition, COST uses FIFO internationally but prefers LIFO in the U.S. for cost-revenue matching, and MO uses LIFO predominantly, aligning with tobacco industry practices. The comparative use of FIFO reflects how each company balances cost accuracy, tax implications, and industry norms.",

Advertising costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred. Certain consumer and trade promotional programs, such as consumer coupons, are recorded as a reduction of sales.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe cost of approximately 75% of inventories is determined using the FIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of the remaining inventories, in the U.S. and Mexico, is determined using the LIFO method, which is stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories in excess of one year of forecasted sales are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent 'Other assets.'\n\n## Property, Plant and E quipment\n\nLand, buildings and machinery and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided, primarily using the straight-line method, over the estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings. Depreciation attributable to manufacturing operations is included in Cost of sales. The remaining component of depreciation is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangibles\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the Company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. In assessing impairment, the Company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis.\n\nDetermining the fair value of the Company's reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. When a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates and the selection of royalty rates and discount rates. The Company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.\n\nAs a result of a reporting structure realignment, the Company reallocated the goodwill of a certain reporting unit from the Europe segment to the North America segment. Before and after the reporting structure realignment, the Company completed an assessment indicating no goodwill impairment was required. Refer to Note 13, Segment Information for additional information.\n\nOther intangible assets with finite lives, such as local brands and trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 40 years. Amortization expense related to intangible assets is included in Other (income) expense, net, which is included in Operating profit.",

T he Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation or deflation rates and inv entory lev els hav e been determined. An immaterial LIFO benefit was recorded in 2024 and an immaterial charge was recorded in 2023.

We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, mortality, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates.\n\nWe recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets and record as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost (income). We subsequently amortize the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) into net periodic benefit cost (income) in future years.\n\n- Fair Value Measurements: We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the ex change price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an ex it price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We use a fair value hierarchy, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are:\n\nLevel 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\n- Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n\n- Guarantees: We recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities. See Note 20 . Contingencies - Guarantees and Other Similar Matters for a further discussion of guarantees.\n- Income Taxes: Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.\n\nWe determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax  rates in effect for the year in which the differences are ex pected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. We determine the realizability of deferred tax  assets based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence. In reaching this determination, we consider the character of the assets and the possible sources of taxable income of the appropriate character within the available carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law.\n\nWe recognize the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions in our consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon ex amination by tax ing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For those income tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax  benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n- Inventories: We use the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method to determine the cost of the majority of our inventories. We determine the cost of the remaining inventories using the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') and average cost methods. We record inventories that are measured using the LIFO method at the lower of cost or market. We state inventories that are measured using the FIFO and average cost methods at the lower of cost and net realizable value. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventories as a current asset although part of such inventories, because of the duration of the curing and aging process, ordinarily would not be used within one year. We determined the cost of approximately 77% and 76% of our inventories at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, using the LIFO method. The recorded LIFO amounts of our inventories were approximately $0.7 billion lower than the current cost of our inventories at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n- Investments in E quity Securities: Investments in equity securities in which we have the ability to ex ercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or the fair value option. The election of the fair value option is irrevocable and is made on an investment by investment basis.\n\nWe elected to account for our investments in ABI and Cronos under the equity method of accounting. Our share of equity (income) losses and other adjustments associated with these investments are included in (income) losses from investments in equity securities in our consolidated statements of earnings. We report the carrying value for each of our investments in ABI and Cronos in investments in equity securities on our consolidated balance sheets. We report equity method investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting at cost and adjust these investments each period for our share of (income) losses and dividends paid, if any. We report our share of ABI's and Cronos's results using a one-quarter lag because results are not available in time for us to record them in the concurrent period. At the end of each reporting period, we review our investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value.

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) emphasizes the role of its Board of Directors in adopting a written Code of Business Conduct applicable to all officers and employees, and a separate Code of Business Conduct for Non-Employee Directors, which reflects the same principles but focuses on matters relevant to directors. Mondel\u0113z International (MDLZ) explicitly states that it has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, along with charters for each of the Board\u2019s four standing committees and a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Non-Employee Directors, all of which are publicly accessible on its website. Philip Morris International (PM) has adopted corporate governance guidelines and committee charters for multiple Board committees\u2014including Audit, Finance, Compensation, and Nominating\u2014and communicates these policies through its website, alongside its Guidebook for Success, which serves as its code of conduct. The synthesis reveals that while all three companies adopt governance frameworks aligned with regulatory standards, they differ in the specificity of documentation, committee structures, and the branding of conduct policies.",

The financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include certain amounts based on our best judgments and estimates. Financial information in this report is consistent with that in the financial statements.\n\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control system is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a written Code of Business Conduct adopted by our Company's Board of Directors, applicable to all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries. In addition, our Company's Board of Directors adopted a written Code of Business Conduct for Non-Employee Directors which reflects the same principles and values as our Code of Business Conduct for officers and employees but focuses on matters of relevance to non-employee Directors.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and, even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ('Exchange Act'). Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) ('COSO') in Internal Control -Integrated Framework . Based on this assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Company's independent auditors, Ernst &amp; Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of our Company's Board of Directors, subject to ratification by our Company's shareowners. Ernst &amp; Young LLP has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries and the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the independent auditors are contained in this report.\n\n## Audit Committee's Responsibility\n\nThe Audit Committee of our Company's Board of Directors, composed solely of Directors who are independent in accordance with the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange listing standards, the Exchange Act, and the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, meets with the independent auditors, management and internal auditors periodically to discuss internal controls along with auditing and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent auditors the scope and results of the audit effort. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor without management present to ensure that the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor have free access to the Audit Committee. Our Audit Committee's Report can be found in the Company's 2022 Proxy Statement.",

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola (KO), Mondelez (MDLZ), and Altria (MO) each characterize their exposure to geopolitical conditions in their 2023 filings, and what does this reveal about their respective supply chain vulnerabilities and risk mitigation strategies?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) highlights that geopolitical conditions, including international conflicts, are among the factors affecting the cost to manufacture and distribute products. Mondelez (MDLZ) specifically names geopolitical conflicts such as the war in Ukraine, sanctions on Russia, developments in the Middle East, and tensions between China and Taiwan as contributors to commodity and input price volatility. Altria (MO) notes that current macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions are impacting the prices, availability, and quality of raw materials used in packaging. While KO emphasizes general exposure, MDLZ provides specific examples of geopolitical events influencing supply chain costs, and MO focuses on sourcing challenges and the potential material adverse effect on operations.",

      "answer": "Altria (MO) uses the LIFO method for the majority of its tobacco inventories, with approximately 81% of its inventories valued under LIFO in 2021, resulting in a $0.6 billion difference from current cost. PepsiCo (PEP) applies LIFO to only a small portion of its inventory, with 7% and 6% of inventory cost computed using LIFO in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and notes that the difference between LIFO and FIFO is not material. Walmart (WMT) uses LIFO for its Walmart U.S. segment inventories under the retail inventory method and Sam's Club uses a weighted-average cost LIFO method, with inventories valued under LIFO approximating FIFO values as of 2022. The comparative analysis shows that LIFO plays a significant role in Altria\u2019s inventory valuation, a minor role at PepsiCo, and a structural but inflation-adjusted role at Walmart, reflecting differing materiality and operational impacts across the companies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nspecified by GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, mortality, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates.\n\nAltria recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost in future years.\n\n- Environmental Costs: Altria is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Altria provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change.\n\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation and compliance costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows. See Note 18. Contingencies -Environmental Regulation .\n\n- Fair Value Measurements: Altria measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Altria uses a fair value hierarchy, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are:\n- Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n- Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n- Guarantees: Altria recognizes a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities. See Note 18 . Contingencies for a further discussion of guarantees.\n- Income Taxes: Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Altria records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Altria determines the realizability of deferred tax assets based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence. In reaching this determination, Altria considers the character of the assets and the possible sources of taxable income of the appropriate character within the available carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law.\n\nAltria recognizes the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Altria recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\n- Inventories: The last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method is used to determine the cost of substantially all tobacco inventories. The cost of the remaining inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') and average cost methods. Inventories that are measured using the LIFO method are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories that are measured using the FIFO and average cost methods are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco and wine inventories as current assets although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the curing and aging process, ordinarily would not be used within one year. The cost of approximately 81% and 59% of inventories at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was determined using the LIFO method. The increase in LIFO percentage was due to the Ste. Michelle Transaction (as Ste. Michelle accounted for its inventory using FIFO). The stated LIFO amounts of inventories were approximately $0.6 billion lower than the current cost of inventories at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n- Investments in Equity Securities: Investments in equity securities in which Altria has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or the fair value option. The election of the fair value option is irrevocable and is made on an investment by investment basis.\n\nAltria elected to account for its investments in ABI and Cronos under the equity method of accounting. Altria's share of equity (income) losses and other adjustments associated with these equity investments are included in (income) losses from equity investments in the consolidated statements of earnings (losses). The carrying value for each of Altria's equity investments in ABI and Cronos is reported in",

Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.\n\n## Other Matters\n\nIn Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned \"Contingencies\" and appears in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \"Item 8.

In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates.\n\nManagement continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.\n\n## Inventories\n\nWe value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\").",

Because the vast majority of our products (such as oral care products, soaps and other personal hygiene products, home cleaners and pet food) have been deemed essential for the health and well-being of people and their pets, we have, in most instances, been able to continue operating our business, although not always at full capacity. In doing so, the health, safety and well-being of our employees and their families has been and remains our first priority. In addition, some of our suppliers, customers, distributors, logistics providers and service providers have experienced disruptions to their businesses.\n\nWe saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories, such as liquid hand soap, dish liquid, bar soap and cleaners, during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by consumer pantry-loading and increased consumption of our products. While consumer demand for most of these categories declined year-over-year in 2021, most remained above historical levels, and we believe that some of this increase in consumption is sustainable in light of changes in consumer behavior related to COVID-19. Across our business, changes in consumer demand for our products vary by product category and geography depending on, among other things, the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, the availability of our products at retailers and supply chain disruptions.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19 have impacted and may continue to impact our consumers' ability to purchase and our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. While we believe that, in the long-term, consumer demand for the products in our categories will continue to be strong, uncertainties continue surrounding the timing and duration of the pandemic and the recovery from it. COVID-19 has also disrupted our retail customers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers and other third parties; their ability to address COVID-19 and maintain their operations at full capacity has impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products. In particular, COVID-19 has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, the travel retail channel. We expect the ongoing economic impact, health concerns associated with COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions to continue to impact consumer behavior, shopping patterns and consumption preferences during 2022.\n\nFor additional information regarding COVID-19's impact on our business, see Part I, Item 1A 'Risk Factors' and Part II, Item 7 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview.'\n\n## Government Regulations\n\nAs a global company, we are subject to extensive governmental regulations, including environmental rules and regulations, in the U.S. and abroad. The most significant government regulations that impact our business are discussed below. It is our policy and practice to comply with all government regulations applicable to our business. In 2021, compliance with these regulations did not have, and we do not expect such compliance in the future to have, a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. For further discussion of how global legal and regulatory requirements may impact our business, see Part I, Item 1A, 'Risk Factors.'\n\nProduct Development : Legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products, including their development, ingredients, formulation, manufacture, packaging content, labeling, storage, transportation, distribution, export, import, advertising, sale and environmental impact. U.S. federal authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Occupational, Health and Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, regulate different aspects of our business, along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas.",

Business' of this report) are essential to the success of our business. We cannot be certain that the legal steps we are taking around the world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights or that, notwithstanding legal protection, others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if changes in laws diminish or remove the current legal protections available to them, the competitiveness of our products may be eroded and our business could suffer. In addition, we could come into conflict with third parties over intellectual property rights, which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation. Any of the foregoing could harm our business.\n\n## Changes in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.\n\nOur Company is subject to various laws and regulations in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business, including laws and regulations relating to competition, product safety, advertising and labeling, container deposits, recycling and product stewardship, the protection of the environment, occupational health and safety, employment and labor practices, personal data protection and privacy, and data security.

In addition, failure to comply with various laws and regulations, such as U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations, antitrust and competition laws, anti-modern slavery laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, data privacy laws, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, tax laws and regulations and a variety of other applicable local, national and multinational regulations and laws could result in litigation, the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, suspension of production or distribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective action, or a cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling partners' facilities, as well as damage to our or our bottling partners' image and reputation, all of which could harm our or our bottling partners' profitability.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO FINANCE, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTMENTS\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In 2021, we used 70 functional currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar and derived $25.6 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in others over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, could materially affect our financial results.\n\n## If interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.\n\nWe maintain levels of debt that we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. When and to the extent appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risks. However, our financial risk management program may not be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations. On December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR'), ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference rates.

We  are  a  leading  international  tobacco  company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving our portfolio for the long-term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector.  Our  current  product  portfolio  primarily  consists  of  cigarettes  and  reduced-risk  products,  including  heat-not-burn,  vapor  and  oral nicotine  products,  which  are  sold  in  markets  outside  the  United  States.  Since  2008,  we  have  invested  more  than  $9  billion  to  develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas  of  pre-clinical  systems  toxicology,  clinical  and  behavioral  research,  as  well  as  post-market  studies.  The  U.S.  Food  and  Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has authorized the marketing of a version of PMI's IQOS Platform 1 device and consumables as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\"), finding that an exposure modification order for these products is appropriate to promote the public health. We describe  the  MRTP  order  in  more  detail  in  the  \"Business  Environment\"  section  of  Item  7. Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life-sciences, in February 2021, we announced our ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and deliver innovative products and solutions that aim to address unmet patient and consumer needs.\n\nIn March 2008, we became a U.S. public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange and subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").\n\nReduced-risk products (\"RRPs\") is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less  risk  of  harm  to  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continuing  to  smoke. We  have  a  range  of  RRPs  in  various  stages  of development,  scientific  assessment  and  commercialization.  Our  RRPs  are  smoke-free  products  that  contain  and/or  generate  far  lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke.\n\nOur IQOS smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products.  Our leading smoke-free platform (\"Platform 1\") is a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTU\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our HEETS , HEETS Creations, HEETS Dimensions, HEETS Marlboro and HEETS FROM MARLBORO ( defined collectively as \" HEETS\") , Marlboro  Dimensions , Marlboro HeatSticks,  Parliament  HeatSticks and TEREA, as  well  as  the  KT&amp;G-licensed  brands, Fiit and Miix (outside of South Korea). Platform 1 was first introduced in Nagoya, Japan, in 2014. As of December 31, 2021, our smoke-free products are available for sale in 71 markets in key cities or nationwide.\n\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 180 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by Marlboro , the world's best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 38% of our total 2021 cigarette shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament . Our other leading international cigarette brands are Bond Street, Chesterfield, L&amp;M , Lark and Philip Morris. These seven international cigarette brands contributed approximately 79% of our cigarette shipment volume in 2021. We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as Dji Sam Soe and Sampoerna A in Indonesia, and Fortune and Jackpot in the Philippines.\n\nDuring  2021,  we  laid  the  foundation  for  our  long-term  growth  ambitions  beyond  nicotine  in  wellness  and  healthcare,  including  the milestone acquisitions of Vectura Group PLC and Fertin Pharma A/S, which provide essential capabilities for future product development.\n\n## Source of Funds - Dividends\n\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries.

      "answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) acquired a controlling interest in a bottling operation in Malawi in August 2022, reflecting a structural change in its Bottling Investments and Europe, Middle East, and Africa operating segments. This indicates a strategic expansion into the region. Philip Morris International (PM) sources tobacco leaf from Malawi as part of its global procurement strategy, highlighting the country\u2019s importance as a supplier of agricultural inputs critical to PMI\u2019s production. Walmart (WMT) operates in Malawi through its Walmart International segment, which includes Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, and Zambia, and is part of its broader Africa strategy to build locally relevant retail operations. Together, these engagements show that Malawi plays a multifaceted role in the global strategies of these companies\u2014ranging from market expansion (KO), raw material sourcing (PM), and retail presence (WMT).",

          "chunk_text": "## Business Strategy\n\nTo achieve our business and financial objectives, we are focused on driving organic sales growth and long-term profitable growth through innovation on our core businesses; leveraging faster growth in adjacent categories; expanding in high-growth channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. We are also seeking to maximize the impact of our ESG programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and DE&amp;I strategies, which we are working to integrate across our organization. We are strengthening our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, eCommerce and data and analytics enabling us to be more responsive in today's rapidly changing world. In particular, we believe our digital transformation is of paramount importance to our success going forward. We continue to invest behind our brands, including through advertising, and to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and eCommerce retailers. We also continue to broaden our eCommerce offerings, including direct-to-consumer and subscription services. We continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products.\n\nWe are also changing the way we work to drive growth and how we approach innovation with focus, empowerment, experimentation and digitization to respond to the dynamic retail landscape and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers. The retail landscape, the ease of new entrants into the market in many of our categories and the evolving preferences of our customers and consumers demand that we work differently and faster in an agile, authentic and culturally relevant manner to drive innovation.\n\nThe investments needed to drive growth are supported through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding-the-growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. We also continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses, including by expanding our portfolio in premium skin health.\n\nOn January 27, 2022, the Board approved a targeted productivity program (the '2022 Global Productivity Initiative'). The program is intended to reallocate resources towards our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in our operations and streamline our supply chain to reduce structural costs. Implementation of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, which is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2022, is projected to result in cumulative pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $200 and $240, which are currently estimated to be comprised of the following: employee-related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (80%); asset-related costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs (10%); and other charges (10%), which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies. It is estimated that approximately 90% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. For more information regarding the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, see 'Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges' below.\n\n## Significant Items Impacting Comparability\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a non-cash charge of $571 pretax ($518 aftertax) to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible related to the Filorga skin health business. The impairment was due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Filorga business as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. See Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\nIn 1990, our Canadian subsidiary ('CP Canada'), issued C$145 of Canadian dollar-denominated unsecured unsubordinated 12.85% guaranteed notes due October 4, 2030 (the 'Canada notes'). In the third quarter of 2021, CP Canada redeemed the Canada notes and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $75 pretax ($55 aftertax), which is included in Interest (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.",

          "chunk_text": "differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and for the manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not.\n\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results; the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset.\n\nThe Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the basis difference meets the indefinite reversal criteria. These criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account items including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the Company's local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability and asset risk. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Operations Review\n\nOur organizational structure consists of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Global Ventures; and Bottling Investments. Our operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of a center and a platform services organization. For additional information regarding our operating segments and Corporate, refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands\n\nIn order to continually improve upon the Company's operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. In addition, we also acquire brands and their related operations or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company's performance.\n\nUnit case volume growth is a metric used by management to evaluate the Company's performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Company's unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading 'Beverage Volume' below.\n\nConcentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Refer to the heading 'Beverage Volume' below.\n\nWhen we analyze our net operating revenues, we generally consider the following factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales volume or unit case volume, as applicable); (2) changes in price, product and geographic mix; (3) foreign currency fluctuations; and (4) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes defined below), as applicable. Refer to the heading 'Net Operating Revenues' below. The Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we do not recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for an unconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to these transactions to the extent of our ownership interest until the equity method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to",

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola's disclosures about the effectiveness of derivative instruments in managing market risks compare with Altria and Philip Morris International's assessments of internal control effectiveness over financial reporting, particularly in terms of risk mitigation focus and compliance assurance?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola emphasizes the use of derivative instruments to mitigate market risks such as foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk, and interest rate risk. The company highlights that due to the high degree of effectiveness between hedging instruments and underlying exposures, fluctuations in derivative values are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the exposures being hedged. In contrast, Altria and Philip Morris International focus on procedural compliance and internal controls over financial reporting, with both companies asserting that their controls are effective and designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting. Altria specifically notes that it excluded NJOY Holdings, Inc. from its assessment, while Philip Morris International makes no such exclusions, indicating a more comprehensive internal control evaluation. The comparative focus reveals that Coca-Cola prioritizes risk mitigation through financial instruments, whereas Altria and Philip Morris International emphasize control design and compliance with accounting principles.",

We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believ e  to  be  reasonable,  and  we  continue  to  rev iew  and  ev aluate  these  estimates.  For  further  information  on  significant  accounting  policies,  see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n\n## Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities\n\nClaims for  employee  health-care  benefits,  workers'  compensation,  general  liability,  property  damage,  directors'  and  officers'  liability,  v ehicle  liability, inv entory  loss,  and  other  exposures  are  funded  predominantly  through  self-insurance.  Insurance  cov erage  is  maintained  for  certain  risks  to  limit exposures to v ery large losses. We use v arious risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captiv e insurance subsidiary, and participate in a  reinsurance  program.  Liabilities  associated  with  the  risks  that  we  retain  are  not  discounted  and  are  estimated  using  historical  claims  experience, demographic factors, sev erity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen dev elopments in claims. While we believ e our estimates are reasonable, actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities. Historically, adjustments to our estimates hav e been immaterial.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n\n## Item 7A-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions)\n\nOur exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculativ e or lev eraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our inv estment holdings that are div ersified among v arious instruments considered to be cash equiv alents, as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term inv estments in gov ernment and agency securities with effectiv e maturities of generally three months to fiv e years at the date of purchase. T he primary objectiv e of our inv estment activ ities is to preserv e principal and secondarily to generate yields. T he majority of our short-term inv estments are in fixed interest-rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair v alue due to interest rate fluctuations.\n\nOur policy limits inv estments in the U.S. to direct U.S. gov ernment and gov ernment agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, U.S. gov ernment and gov ernment agency money market funds, and insured bank balances. Our whollyowned captiv e insurance subsidiary inv ests in U.S. gov ernment and gov ernment agency obligations and U.S. gov ernment and gov ernment agency money market funds. Our Canadian and Other International subsidiaries' inv estments are primarily in money market funds, bankers' acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies.\n\nA 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2024 would hav e had an immaterial incremental change in fair market v alue.  For those inv estments  that  are  classified  as  av ailable-for-sale,  the  unrealized  gains  or  losses  related  to  fluctuations  in  market  v olatility  and  interest  rates  are reflected",

If we are unable to effectiv ely manage these costs or if we face  significant  increases  in  any  of  these  costs,  our  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  could  be  adv ersely  affected.  In  particular ,  for  certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay interchange fees and other processing fees. Giv en the continued adoption of credit and debit cards by consumers, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs as a result of these fees. Any increase in these fees over time could significantly increase our expenses and adv ersely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Legal, Regulatory, Global, and Other External Risks\n\n## Our earnings depend on the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence and spending in the U.S.\n\nNearly all of our sales are in the U.S., making our results highly dependent on the health of the U.S. economy and U.S. consumer behav ior, confidence, and spending, which can be affected by a v ariety of factors, including inflation, interest rates, housing prices, unemployment rates, legal and regulatory actions (including  through  executiv e  orders),  immigration  policies  and  trends,  household  debt  and  wage  lev els,  credit  usage,  and  crime  rates.  In  addition,  the interconnected  nature  of  the  global  economy  means  that  ev ents  occurring  domestically  or  internationally,  such  as  geopolitical  conflicts,  social  unrest, terrorist  attacks,  armed  conflicts,  public  health  crises,  legal  and  regulatory  actions,  immigration  policies  and  trends,  energy  av ailability,  trade  policies, disputes,  or  sanctions,  and  market  v olatility  can  all  affect  macroeconomic  conditions  in  the  U.S. A  deterioration  in  U.S.  macroeconomic  conditions  or consumer  confidence  or  spending  could  adv ersely  affect  our  business  in  many  ways,  such  as  negativ ely  impacting  consumer  demand  (which  may disproportionately affect demand for certain merchandise), reducing sales (including our credit card profit-sharing rev enue), reducing gross margins, and increasing our expenses, each of which could adv ersely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions or natural disasters, the impacts of a changing climate, and other catastrophic events could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nUncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, including the physical impacts of a changing climate, and other catastrophic ev ents can affect consumer shopping patterns, particularly in apparel and seasonal items, which could lead to lower sales or greater than expected markdowns and adv ersely affect our results of operations. In addition, we hav e significant operations in certain states where natural disasters (including hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, and earthquakes) are more prev alent. Natural disasters in those states or in other areas where we operate has prev iously resulted, and could in the future result,  in  significant  physical  damage  to,  or  closure  of,  one  or  more  of  our  stores,  distribution  centers,  facilities,  or  key  v endors.  Furthermore,  weather conditions,  natural  disasters,  and  other  catastrophic  ev ents  in  areas  where  we  or  our  v endors  operate,  or  depend  upon  for  continued  operations,  hav e adversely affected, and could in the future adv ersely affect, the av ailability and cost of certain products within our supply chain, consumer purchasing power, and consumer demand. Additionally, acts of v iolence and other crimes, including activ e shooter situations, at or around our stores, distribution centers, or other facilities may negativ ely impact the safety and security of our workforce and guests, damage our facilities, and harm our reputation. Any of these events could adv ersely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe potential  impacts  of  a  changing  climate  may  be  widespread  and  unpredictable  and  present  a  v ariety  of  risks  in  the  short-term  and  long-term.  T he physical effects of a changing climate, such as natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, drought, and rising sea lev els, could adv ersely affect our results  of  operations,  including  by  increasing  our  energy  costs,  disrupting  our  supply  chain,  negativ ely  impacting  our  workforce,  damaging  our  stores, distribution centers, and inv entory, and threatening the habitability of the locations in which we operate. In addition to physical risks, the potential impacts of a changing climate also present transition risks, including regulatory and reputational risks. For example, we use commodities and energy inputs in our operations that may face increased regulation due to a changing climate or other env ironmental concerns, which could increase our costs. Furthermore, our establishment and continuation of our goals and initiativ es to create a more resilient business, or any modification, conclusion, failure, or perceiv ed failure by  us  to  achiev e  them,  or  to  otherwise  meet  ev olv ing,  v aried,  and  sometimes  conflicting  expectations  from  our  shareholders,  guests,  team  members, vendors, and other third parties (including gov ernmental entities and officials and non-gov ernmental organizations) regarding the env ironment and our goals and initiativ es  to  create  a  more  resilient  business,  could  lead  to  adv erse  perceptions  of  our  business,  consumer  boycotts, litigation,  inv estigations,  and regulatory proceedings. Any of these outcomes could adv ersely affect our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition.",

Target (TGT) identifies product availability risks stemming from macroeconomic conditions, public health crises like the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and climate-related disruptions that affect supply chains and consumer purchasing patterns.

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Procter & Gamble differ in their approaches to managing workforce turnover risks?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola emphasizes the potential negative consequences of productivity initiatives, such as distractions, disruption to operations, and deterioration in employee morale, which could affect retention. They also highlight challenges in attracting and retaining a skilled workforce, particularly in areas like AI, machine learning, and digital marketing, due to increased competition and labor market shortages. PepsiCo similarly identifies employee turnover as a risk, noting that unplanned turnover or labor shortages could deplete institutional knowledge, erode competitive advantage, and increase costs due to higher employee turnover or benefit expenses. They specifically mention the impact on leadership roles and the need for succession planning. Procter & Gamble takes a more structured financial modeling approach, incorporating employee turnover into its pension and OPRB plan assumptions. They quantify the impact of turnover on benefit obligations and use historical experiences and management judgment to estimate variables like retirement age and mortality. While KO and PEP frame turnover as an operational and talent risk, PG integrates it into its long-term financial planning and liability forecasting, showing a more actuarial perspective.",

      "question": "How do Colgate-Palmolive (CL), Philip Morris International (PM), and Walmart (WMT) each reflect the strategic or financial significance of their operations in Argentina, and what does this reveal about their regional priorities in Latin America?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive experienced organic sales growth in Argentina as part of broader Latin American momentum, driven by categories like Oral Care and Personal Care. In contrast, Philip Morris International incurred $15 million in asset impairment costs related to cigarette plant closures in Argentina, signaling a contraction in its operations there. Meanwhile, Walmart exited the Argentine market entirely in fiscal 2021, selling off its operations as part of a broader divestiture strategy in underperforming international markets.

          "chunk_text": "\nNet sales in Latin America increased 7.0% in 2021 to $3,663, as volume growth of 1.0% and net selling price increases of 7.0% were partially offset by negative foreign exchange of 1.0%. Organic sales in Latin America increased 8.0% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in Latin America in 2021 versus 2020 was due to increases in Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the bar soap and underarm protection categories. The increase in Home Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the fabric softener and liquid cleaner categories.\n\nOperating profit in Latin America increased 4% in 2021 to $1,012, while as a percentage of Net sales it decreased 90 bps to 27.6%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to a decrease in Gross profit (150 bps), partially offset by a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses (20 bps) and a decrease in Other (income) expense, net (40 bps), all as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (740 bps), which were partially offset by cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (330 bps) and higher pricing. This decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to decreased advertising investment (70 bps), partially offset by higher overhead expenses (50 bps), primarily driven by higher logistics costs. The decrease in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to a value added tax refund.",

Segments and Disaggregated Revenue\n\n## Segments\n\nThe Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 for discussion of recent divestitures. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\n\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.\n\nThe Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income before income taxes, is provided in the following table:\n\n",

MO emphasizes its localized sourcing strategy in high-risk regions, achieving a 9% improvement in supply chain resilience by reducing lead times. PM reports a 15% increase in regional supplier engagement, directly linking this shift to a more sustainable and responsive supply base.

('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

The National Health Insurance Service seeks to recover damages allegedly incurred in treating 3,484 patients with small cell lung cancer, squamous cell lung cancer, and squamous cell laryngeal cancer from 2003 to 2012. The trial court dismissed the case in its entirety on November 20, 2020. Plaintiff appealed.\n\nLabel-Related Cases: These cases, now brought only by individual plaintiffs, allege that the use of the descriptor 'Lights' or other alleged misrepresentations or omissions of labeling information constitute fraudulent and misleading conduct. Plaintiffs' allegations of liability in these  cases  are  based  on  various  theories  of  recovery  including  misrepresentation,  deception,  and  breach  of  consumer  protection  laws. Plaintiffs seek various forms of relief including restitution, injunctive relief, and compensatory and other damages.

          "chunk_text": "The total impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net operating revenues, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 5% and 4% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The total impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating income, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 11% and 8% in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nForeign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are recorded in the line item other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income. Refer to the heading 'Operations Review - Other Income (Loss) - Net' above. The Company recorded net foreign currency exchange losses of $180 million and $312 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices\n\nInflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.\n\n## ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nOur Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures, fluctuations in the values of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the values of the underlying exposures.\n\nWe monitor our exposure to market risks using several objective measurement systems, including a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our hedging transactions and derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\n\nWe manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 2024, we generated $28.7 billion of our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nOur Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency options and collars (principally euro, British pound and Japanese yen) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\n\nThe total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives were $18,442 million and $17,505 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These values included derivative instruments that were designated and qualified for hedge accounting along with derivative instruments that are economic hedges. The fair value of foreign currency derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $366 million as of December 31, 2024, and we estimate that a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $511 million decrease in fair value. The fair value of the foreign currency derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $62 million as of December 31, 2024, and we estimate that a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $325 million decrease in fair value.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to ex isting and future issuances of debt. We monitor our mix  of fix ed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of short-term debt and long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.",

Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adv erse effects that the v olatility of these markets may hav e on our operating results.\n\nWe principally utilize deriv ativ e instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from v olatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our deriv ativ e activ ity and the types of deriv ativ e instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 10, Financial Instruments .\n\nMany of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create v olatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the  U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated  reporting  generally  results  in  a  cumulativ e  translation  adjustment  to  other  comprehensiv e  income  within  equity. A  stronger  U.S.  dollar relativ e to other functional currencies adv ersely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate v olatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Operations by Operating Segment under Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results for  currency  exchange  effects  on  our  financial  results.  T hroughout  our  discussion  and  analysis  of  results,  we  isolate  currency  impacts  and supplementally prov ide net rev enues, operating income and diluted earnings per share on a constant currency basis. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, recent currency dev aluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting .\n\nWe also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather  conditions,  gov ernment  policy  and  regulation  and  the  macroeconomic  env ironment.  Refer  to Recent  Developments  and  Significant  Items Affecting Comparability and Financial Outlook above for updates on recent supply chain, labor and other disruptions that are increasing operating costs and  impacting  our  results.  T o  manage  input  cost  v olatility  and  inflation,  we  enter  into  forward  purchase  agreements  and  other  deriv ativ e  financial instruments. We also pursue productiv ity and cost sav ing measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings.\n\nWe regularly ev aluate our v ariable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures  include  mov ements  in  U.S.  T reasury  rates,  corporate  credit  spreads,  commercial  paper  rates  as  well  as  limited  debt  tied  to  Secured Overnight  Financing  Rates  ('SOFR').  We  periodically  use  interest  rate  swaps  and  forward  interest  rate  contracts  to  achiev e  a  desired  proportion  of variable  v ersus  fixed-rate  debt  based  on  current  and  projected  market  conditions.  For  more  information  on  our  debt  activ ity,  see  Note  9, Debt  and Borrowing Arrangements .\n\nSee Note 10, Financial Instruments , for more information on our deriv ativ e activ ity.\n\n## Value at Risk\n\nWe use a value at risk ('VAR') computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair v alue of our interest rate-sensitiv e financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitiv e deriv ativ e financial instruments. T he VAR analysis was done separately as of each quarter end for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios using historical market mov ements. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receiv ables, and net inv estments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the abov e-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.",

      "answer": "Costco highlights that disruptions in merchandise distribution, including delays from natural disasters or logistics issues, could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction, particularly for its Kirkland Signature brand, which represents a growing portion of sales and carries higher margins. PepsiCo notes that supply chain disruptions could negatively impact product availability, potentially decreasing demand for its products and leading to inventory write-offs. Walmart emphasizes that supply chain interruptions, especially those related to the ongoing effects of the pandemic and global events, could lead to out-of-stock positions, inventory imbalances, and delivery delays, all of which impact customer satisfaction and financial performance. Together, these perspectives show that all three companies view product availability as critical to maintaining customer trust and financial stability, with each identifying unique but interrelated risks tied to supply chain reliability.",

The  effectiveness  of  these  investments  can  be  less  predictable  than opening new locations and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return.\n\n## Our failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nMembership  loyalty  and  growth  are  essential  to  our  business.  The  extent  to  which  we  achieve  growth  in  our membership  base,  increase  the  penetration  of  Executive  membership,  and  sustain  high  renewal  rates  materially influences  our  profitability.  Damage  to  our  brands  or  reputation  may  negatively  impact  comparable  sales,  diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations.\n\nWe sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and  availability  of  these  products  is  essential  to  developing  and  maintaining  member  loyalty.  These  products  also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.\n\n## Disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction.\n\nWe  depend  on  the  orderly  operation  of  the  merchandise  receiving  and  distribution  process,  primarily  through  our depots. We also rely upon processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items. Although we believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due  to  fires,  tornadoes,  hurricanes,  earthquakes,  pandemics  or  other  extreme  weather  conditions  or  catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members. Our e-commerce operations depend  heavily  on  third-party  and  in-house  logistics  providers  and  is  negatively  affected  when  these  providers  are unable to provide services in a timely fashion.\n\n## We  may  not  timely  identify  or  effectively  respond  to  consumer  trends,  which  could  negatively  affect  our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.\n\nIt  is  difficult  to  consistently  and  successfully  predict  the  products  and  services  that  our  members  will  desire.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to environmental, social and governance practices) and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns, or we may experience out-of-stock positions and delivery delays, which could result in higher costs, both of which would reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income.\n\n## Availability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital to our business. Failure to successfully execute IT projects and have IT systems available to our business would adversely impact our operations.\n\nIT systems play a crucial role in conducting our business. These systems are utilized to process a very high volume of transactions,  conduct  payment  transactions,  track  and  value  our  inventory  and  produce  reports  critical  for  making business decisions. Failure or disruption of these systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to buy products and services from our suppliers, produce goods in our manufacturing plants, move the products in an efficient manner to  our  warehouses  and  sell  products  to  our  members.

In addition, our business operations, including our supply chain, are subject to disruption by natural disasters or other events beyond our control that could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not effectively resolve these issues.\n\n## Damage to our reputation or brand image can adversely affect our business.\n\nMaintaining a positive reputation globally is critical to selling our products. Our reputation or brand image has in the past been, and could in the future be, adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including: any failure  by  us  or  our  business  partners  to  maintain  high  ethical,  business  and  environmental,  social  and governance  practices,  including  with  respect  to  human  rights,  child  labor  laws,  diversity,  equity  and inclusion, workplace conditions and employee health and safety; any failure to achieve our environmental, social and governance goals, including with respect to the nutrition profile of our products, diversity, equity and  inclusion  initiatives,  packaging,  water  use  and  our  impact  on  the  environment;  any  failure  to  address health  concerns  about  our  products,  products  we  distribute,  or  particular  ingredients  in  our  products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity or an increase in public health costs; our research and development efforts; any product quality or safety issues, including the recall of  any  of  our  products;  any  failure  to  comply  with  laws  and  regulations;  consumer  perception  of  our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, marketing programs, use of social media and our response to  political  and  social  issues  or  catastrophic  events;  or  any  failure  to  effectively  respond  to  negative  or inaccurate comments about us on social media or otherwise regarding any of the foregoing. Damage to our reputation or brand image has in the past and could in the future decrease demand for our products, thereby adversely affecting our business.\n\n## Product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety can adversely affect our business.\n\nWe have and could in the future recall products due to product quality or safety issues, including actual or alleged  mislabeling,  misbranding,  spoilage,  undeclared  allergens,  adulteration  or  contamination.  Product recalls have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business by resulting in losses due to their cost, the destruction of product inventory or lost sales due to any unavailability of the product for a period of time. In addition, product quality or safety issues, whether as a result of failure to comply with food safety laws or otherwise, have in the past and could in the future also reduce consumer confidence and demand for our products, cause production and delivery disruptions, and result in increased costs (including payment of fines and/or judgments) and damage our reputation, particularly as we expand into new categories, such as nuts and meat convenient foods globally and the distribution of alcoholic beverages in the United States, all of which can adversely affect our business. Failure to maintain adequate oversight over product quality or safety  can  result  in  product  recalls,  litigation,  government  investigations  or  inquiries  or  civil  or  criminal proceedings, all of which may result in fines, penalties, damages or criminal liability. Our business can also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality, safety and integrity generally, even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio.",

In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance, business relationship or in certain of our recently divested markets, could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\n## Operational Risks\n\n## The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial position and results of operations continues to be unpredictable, and we may be unable to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future.\n\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be highly unpredictable and volatile in light of the potential for a resurgence of infection rates or as a result of future mutations, variants, or related strains of the virus. Recent years have demonstrated the widespread and varying impacts of the pandemic on certain business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, access to inventory, supply chain operations, the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus (such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business and government shutdowns, and other restrictions on retailers), our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things.\n\nCustomer behaviors have changed rapidly during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event of a resurgence of infections or future mutations, variants or related strains of the virus become prevalent, customer demand for certain products may fluctuate and customer behaviors may change, which may challenge our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. These factors may result in higher out-of-stock positions in certain products, as well as delays in delivering those products, and could impact inventory levels in the future.\n\nOther factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there are additional outbreaks or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we and our suppliers operate; further increased operational costs associated with operating during a global pandemic; evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time, capital and other resources to the pandemic response; the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and medical treatments for COVID-19 or other variants; the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides; and the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors. These risks and their impacts are difficult to predict and could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and our financial performance.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased revenue growth relative to historic trends, and has particularly accelerated our eCommerce growth. These results, as well as those of other metrics such as net income and other financial and operating data, may not be indicative of results for future periods. Once the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, particularly as vaccines become more widely available, and customers return to work or school or are otherwise no longer subject to the aforementioned containment directives and similar mandates, a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities may result in declining revenue and future operating results may fall below expectations.\n\nTo the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S. and the global economy, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, our reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Natural disasters, climate change, geopolitical events, global health epidemics or pandemics and catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons; weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; geopolitical events; global health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and catastrophic events, such as war, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in our U.S. stores), in countries in which we operate, in which our suppliers are located, or in other areas of the world (such as in Ukraine where armed hostilities currently exist between Ukraine and Russia) could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\n\nSuch events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution and fulfillment centers are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings, travel and movement limitations or otherwise) and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, increases in the costs of procuring products as a result of either reduced availability",

PepsiCo (PEP) actively manages interest rate risk as part of a broader market risk strategy that includes commodities and foreign exchange, using productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs, and hedging. Philip Morris International (PM) employs a range of hedging techniques, including fair value hedges and cash flow hedges, with specific derivative contracts to offset interest rate fluctuations on fixed-rate debt, such as $398 million in hedged debt as of December 31, 2021.

Business' of this report) are essential to the success of our business. We cannot be certain that the legal steps we are taking around the world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights or that, notwithstanding legal protection, others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if changes in laws diminish or remove the current legal protections available to them, the competitiveness of our products may be eroded and our business could suffer. In addition, we could come into conflict with third parties over intellectual property rights, which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation. Any of the foregoing could harm our business.\n\n## Changes in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.\n\nOur Company is subject to various laws and regulations in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business, including laws and regulations relating to competition, product safety, advertising and labeling, container deposits, recycling and product stewardship, the protection of the environment, occupational health and safety, employment and labor practices, personal data protection and privacy, and data security. For additional information regarding laws and regulations applicable to our business, refer to the heading 'Governmental Regulation' set forth in Part I, 'Item 1. Business' of this report. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, including increased or additional regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change; to discourage the use of plastic materials, including regulations relating to recovery and/or disposal of plastic bottles and other packaging materials due to environmental concerns; or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners, which could affect our profitability, or may impede the production, distribution, marketing and sale of our products, which could affect our net operating revenues. In addition, failure to comply with various laws and regulations, such as U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations, antitrust and competition laws, anti-modern slavery laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, data privacy laws, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, tax laws and regulations and a variety of other applicable local, national and multinational regulations and laws could result in litigation, the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, suspension of production or distribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective action, or a cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling partners' facilities, as well as damage to our or our bottling partners' image and reputation, all of which could harm our or our bottling partners' profitability.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO FINANCE, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTMENTS\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In 2021, we used 70 functional currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar and derived $25.6 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in others over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, could materially affect our financial results.\n\n## If interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.\n\nWe maintain levels of debt that we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. When and to the extent appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risks. However, our financial risk management program may not be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations. On December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR'), ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference rates.

          "chunk_text": "## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nPMI  has  entered  into  derivative  contracts  to  hedge  the  foreign  currency  exchange  and  interest  rate  risks  related  to  certain  forecasted transactions.  Gains  and  losses  associated  with  qualifying  cash  flow  hedge  contracts  are  deferred  as  components  of  accumulated  other comprehensive  losses  until  the  underlying  hedged  transactions  are  reported  in  PMI's  consolidated  statements  of  earnings.  As  of December 31, 2021, PMI has hedged forecasted transactions for periods not exceeding the next twelve months, with the exception of one derivative  contract  that  expires  in  May  2024.  The  impact  of  these  hedges  is  primarily  included  in  operating  cash  flows  on  PMI's consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Fair Value Hedges\n\nPMI has entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts, designated as fair value hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate U.S. dollar-denominated debt that results from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. For derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized in current earnings. The carrying amount of the debt hedged, which includes the cumulative adjustment for fair value gains/losses, as of December 31, 2021 was $398 million, and is recorded in long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations\n\nPMI designates derivative contracts and certain foreign currency denominated debt instruments as net investment hedges, primarily of its Euro net assets. The amount of pre-tax gain/(loss) related to these debt instruments, that was reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive  losses  within  currency  translation  adjustment,  was  $278  million,  $(465)  million  and  $234  million,  for  the  years  ended December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  The  premiums  paid  for,  and  settlements  of,  net  investment  hedges  are  included  in investing cash flows on PMI's consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Other Derivatives\n\nPMI has entered  into  derivative  contracts  to  hedge  the  foreign  currency  exchange  and  interest  rate  risks  related  to  intercompany  loans between certain subsidiaries, and third-party loans. While effective as economic hedges, no hedge accounting is applied for these contracts; therefore, the gains (losses) relating to these contracts are reported in PMI's consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Qualifying Hedging Activities Reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses\n\nDerivative gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive losses are a result of qualifying hedging activity. Transfers of these gains  or  losses  to  earnings  are  offset  by  the  corresponding  gains  or  losses  on  the  underlying  hedged  item.  Hedging  activity  affected accumulated other comprehensive losses, net of income taxes, as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive uses the straight-line method for depreciation of buildings and machinery, with useful lives ranging from 3 to 40 years, and allocates depreciation between cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Costco also applies the straight-line method for property and equipment, depreciating leasehold improvements over the shorter of the asset\u2019s useful life or the remaining lease term. Walmart depreciates its property and equipment on a straight-line basis using estimated useful lives, though specific ranges are not disclosed. These approaches reflect varying degrees of specificity and operational emphasis in asset management, with Colgate-Palmolive providing detailed life ranges and cost allocation, Costco focusing on leasehold considerations, and Walmart maintaining a more generalized policy.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive applies the LIFO method to inventories in the U.S. and Mexico, which represent approximately 25% of total inventories, while the majority (75%) are valued under FIFO. Costco uses LIFO for U.S. merchandise inventories and recorded an immaterial LIFO charge in 2023, reflecting inflationary impacts. Altria uses LIFO for the majority (76%) of its inventories and reported that LIFO inventories were $0.7 billion lower than current costs at the end of 2023. These differences suggest that while all three companies utilize LIFO, they do so to varying degrees and with distinct implications for cost of goods sold and financial reporting stability.",

PEP discloses using derivatives and local currency contracts to manage commodity and foreign exchange risks tied to supplier relationships, with $1.7 billion in commodity derivatives and $3.8 billion in foreign currency derivatives as of December 30, 2023. WMT explicitly builds relationships with regional and local suppliers in international markets to ensure reliable, high-quality, low-cost merchandise supply.

      "answer": "COST accounts for non-lease components together with lease components for all asset classes, treating them as a single lease component. PEP similarly combines lease and non-lease components for real estate leases, including items like common-area maintenance. TGT also combines lease and non-lease components for new and reassessed leases. While all three companies follow a similar IFRS/ASC 842-based approach, the differences lie in how each articulates the treatment of variable components and lease term assumptions. COST emphasizes its treatment of renewal options and straight-line rent recognition, PEP highlights its use of incremental borrowing rates for present value calculations, and TGT specifies its handling of percentage-based rent payments and inflation-linked adjustments.",

The Coca-Cola Company (KO) emphasizes that price controls and profit limitations have been or may be imposed in response to geopolitical instability, affecting profitability in key international markets such as those impacted by the Ukraine conflict and Middle East tensions. Procter & Gamble (PG) notes that price controls or governmental actions may restrict its ability to adjust pricing in response to demand volatility or supply chain disruptions, particularly during public health crises or geopolitical upheaval.

Actual events or results may differ materially because of factors that affect international businesses and global economic conditions, as well as matters specific to the Company and the markets it serves, including the uncertain macroeconomic and political environment in different countries, including as a result of inflation and higher interest rates, and its effect on consumer confidence and spending, foreign currency rate fluctuations, ex change controls, import restrictions, tariffs, sanctions, price or profit controls, labor relations, changes in foreign or domestic laws or regulations or their interpretation, political and fiscal developments, including changes in trade, tax  and immigration policies, increased competition and evolving competitive practices, the ability to operate and respond effectively during a pandemic, epidemic or widespread public health concern, the ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain and/or key office facilities, the ability to manage the availability and cost of raw and packaging materials and logistics costs, the ability to maintain or increase selling prices as needed, changes in the policies of retail trade customers, the emergence of alternative retail channels, the growth of eCommerce and the rapidly changing retail landscape, the ability to develop innovative new products and successfully adopt new technologies (such as artificial intelligence), the ability to continue lowering costs and operate in an agile manner, the ability to maintain the security of our information and operational technology systems from a cybersecurity incident or data breach, the ability to address the effects of climate change and achieve our sustainability and social impact goals, the ability to complete acquisitions and divestitures as planned, the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, the ability to attract and retain key employees, the uncertainty of the outcome of legal proceedings, whether or not the Company believes they have merit, and the ability to address uncertain or unfavorable global economic conditions, including inflation, disruptions in the credit markets and tax matters.

The information on the Company's website is not incorporated by reference in this report. We make available on or through our website certain reports and amendments to those reports that we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ('Exchange Act'). These include our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Current Reports on Form 8-K. We make this information available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the information with, or furnish it to, the SEC. In addition, we routinely post on the 'Investors' page of our website news releases, announcements and other statements about our business and results of operations. We may use the 'Investors' page of our website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and to comply with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Therefore, we encourage investors to monitor the 'Investors' page of our website and review the information we post on that page.\n\nThe SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at the following address: http://www.sec.gov.\n\n## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\n\n## Unfavorable general economic and geopolitical conditions could negatively impact our financial results.\n\nOur business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions, including global inflationary pressures, prevailing interest rates, credit market conditions, increased unemployment, levels of consumer and business confidence, bank failures, commodity (including energy) prices and supply, a recession or economic slowdown, trade policies, foreign currency exchange rates, changing policy positions or priorities, governmental rules and approaches to taxation, levels of government spending and deficits, and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt. Many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced, and could continue to experience, unfavorable changes in economic conditions, which could negatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, our beverages, and certain markets in which our products are sold experienced intensified inflation throughout 2024, which may continue in 2025. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower-priced products offered by other companies, including private-label brands, which could reduce our profitability and negatively affect our overall financial performance. In addition, the occurrence of global or regional health events, and any related governmental, private sector and individual consumer responses, could contribute to a recession, depression or global economic downturn.\n\nOther financial uncertainties in our major markets and unstable geopolitical conditions or events in certain markets, including international conflicts, civil unrest, acts of war, terrorism, governmental changes, or changes in international relations, could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers' purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. Throughout 2024, the Company faced disruption to our operations due to international conflicts, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East. Geopolitical instability has in the past led, and may in the future lead, to logistical, transportation and supply chain disruptions; business disruptions (including labor shortages); increased risk of cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions to our information systems; reduced availability and increased costs of transportation, energy, packaging, raw materials and other input costs; and heightened security risk, impacting employee safety and/or damage to infrastructure or our assets. At times, we have faced product boycotts resulting from political activism, which have reduced demand for our products. Restrictions on our ability to transfer earnings or capital across borders; price controls; limitations on profits; the negotiation of new trade agreements; new, expanded or retaliatory tariffs; import authorization requirements; and other restrictions on business activities, which have been or may be imposed or expanded as a result of political and economic instability, deterioration of economic relations between countries or otherwise, could impact our profitability. In addition, U.S. trade sanctions against countries designated by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism and/or financial institutions accepting transactions for commerce within such countries could increase significantly, which could make it difficult, or even impossible, for us to continue to make sales to bottlers in such countries. The imposition of retaliatory sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations by countries that are or may become subject to U.S. trade sanctions, or the delisting of our branded products by retailers in various countries in reaction to U.S. trade sanctions or other governmental actions or policies, could also negatively affect our business.",

Additionally, we could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, governmental inquiries, reporting requirements, investigations or regulatory enforcement actions; and we could be subject to payment of fines or other penalties, legal claims by our suppliers, customers or employees and significant remediation costs.\n\nPeriodically, we and/or our suppliers also upgrade IT/OT systems or adopt new technologies, including those enabled by machine learning or artificial intelligence. If such a new system or technology does not function properly, provides flawed or inaccurate outputs or exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures, it could affect our ability to order materials, make and ship orders and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues. The costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows and generate negative publicity affecting Company reputation and relationships among consumers, customers and other business partners.\n\n## We must successfully manage the demand, supply and operational challenges associated with the effects of any future disease outbreak, including epidemics, pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns.\n\nOur business may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic or similar widespread public health concern. These impacts may include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products or stockpiling or similar pantry-loading activity. If prolonged, such impacts can further increase the difficulty of business or operations planning and may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows; or\n- Significant  changes  in  the  political  conditions  in  markets  in  which  we  manufacture,  sell  or  distribute  our  products,  including  quarantines,  import/ex port restrictions, price controls, or governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees' ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations.\n\nDespite efforts to manage and remedy these impacts, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects.\n\n## BUSINESS STRATEGY &amp; ORGANIZATIONAL RISKS\n\n## Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation, evolving digital marketing and selling platforms and changing consumer habits.\n\nWe are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. Achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. The success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others and to continue to deliver efficient and effective marketing across  evolving  media  and  mobile  platforms  with  dynamic  and  increasingly  more  restrictive  privacy  requirements.  We  must  also  successfully  respond  to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors, customers and vendors. Failure to continually innovate, improve and respond to competitive moves, changing consumer habits and platform evolution, including the timely and effective adoption of emerging technologies, could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## We must successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities.\n\nAs a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. Specifically, our financial results have been, and in the future could be, adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures. Our results of operations and cash flows have been, and in the future could also be, impacted by acquisitions or joint venture activities, if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges, which could also result in an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.\n\nOur business  results  depend  on  our  ability  to  successfully  manage  productivity  improvements  and  ongoing  organizational  change,  including  attracting  and retaining key talent as part of our overall succession planning.\n\nOur financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings, including staffing adjustments and employee departures.

      "question": "How do Colgate-Palmolive (CL), Costco (COST), and Altria (MO) each structure their defined contribution plans for U.S. employees, and what do their respective disclosures reveal about the financial impact and strategic intent behind these retirement benefit frameworks?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive transitioned virtually all future retirement benefits to a defined contribution plan in 2014, freezing pay credits for most participants in its defined benefit plan while continuing interest credits on vested balances. This shift reflects a long-term liability management strategy. Costco matches a portion of employee contributions to its 401(k) plan and provides annual discretionary contributions, expensing $963 million in 2024, $914 million in 2023, and $824 million in 2022, indicating a consistent and growing investment in employee retirement benefits. Altria offers a defined contribution plan with enhanced benefits to employees hired after certain dates, replacing eligibility in its noncontributory defined benefit pension plans, suggesting a phased transition toward defined contribution structures. Collectively, these approaches show a sector-wide movement from defined benefit to defined contribution plans, with COST demonstrating the highest ongoing financial commitment, while CL and MO use defined contribution plans to reduce long-term liability exposure.",

        "Hop 2: COST \u2192 Defined Contribution Plan: Costco matches a portion of employee 401(k) contributions and provides annual discretionary contributions, with retirement plan expenses totaling $963M (2024), $914M (2023), and $824M (2022), showing a growing financial commitment.",

      "question": "How do Colgate-Palmolive (CL), The Coca-Cola Company (KO), and Procter & Gamble (PG) each describe the impact of counterfeit products on brand equity, consumer trust, and financial performance, and what specific risks do they highlight in their 2023 disclosures?",
      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive (CL) notes that counterfeit products, which are inferior or pose safety risks, could lead consumers to confuse them with genuine products, harming brand equity and financial performance. The Coca-Cola Company (KO) emphasizes that counterfeit or 'spurious' products in emerging markets may tarnish brand image and reputation, affecting consumer preferences and sales. Procter & Gamble (PG) warns that counterfeit products could damage brand reputation, leading to a material impact on financial results, especially if consumers associate counterfeit quality issues with PG's genuine products. While all three companies highlight reputational and financial risks, CL focuses on consumer confusion and safety, KO on brand image in emerging markets, and PG on the broader reputational and financial consequences tied to product integrity.",

      "question": "How do COST, MDLZ, and MO each assess the impact of U.S. laws on their international operations, and what do their disclosures reveal about the varying degrees of regulatory exposure faced by consumer staples companies operating globally?",
      "answer": "COST highlights that future international operating results could be negatively affected by a variety of factors including U.S. laws and regulations, such as trade tariffs, monetary policies, and new reporting obligations that increase the cost and complexity of doing business globally. MDLZ, which generated over 73% of its 2023 net revenues outside the U.S., specifically notes compliance with U.S. laws like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) as a key regulatory risk and emphasizes the challenges of navigating diverse legal frameworks across approximately 80 countries. MO, while primarily focused on the U.S. market, acknowledges exposure to U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and foreign privacy laws through its limited international business activities, and stresses the reputational and financial risks associated with potential violations. Together, these disclosures illustrate differing levels of international regulatory exposure and strategic emphasis on compliance with U.S. laws affecting global operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COST \u2192 U.S. Laws: COST indicates that U.S. laws and regulations\u2014such as trade tariffs, monetary policies, and new reporting obligations\u2014pose risks that could increase the cost and complexity of doing business internationally.",
        "Hop 2: MDLZ \u2192 U.S. Laws: MDLZ specifically names the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) as a key compliance requirement under U.S. laws and highlights the challenges of operating in approximately 80 countries, with over 73% of 2023 revenues generated outside the U.S.",
        "Hop 3: MO \u2192 U.S. Laws: MO acknowledges exposure to U.S. laws like the FCPA and foreign privacy laws through its limited international operations and emphasizes the reputational and financial risks of potential violations."

      "question": "How do Costco, PepsiCo, and Walmart each characterize their business relationship with Walmart, and what does this reveal about their respective strategic positions in the consumer staples sector?",
      "answer": "Costco identifies Walmart as a major competitor in the U.S. general merchandise retail space, highlighting the intense competition in pricing, product selection, and convenience. PepsiCo, on the other hand, views Walmart as a critical customer, with 14% of its 2023 consolidated net revenue tied to sales through Walmart and its affiliates, including concentrate sales to independent bottlers who supply Walmart. Walmart itself emphasizes its role as a market leader focused on everyday low prices and omni-channel growth, while also acknowledging the challenges posed by inflation and supply chain disruptions. Together, these perspectives reveal that while Costco competes directly with Walmart, PepsiCo depends on Walmart as a major distribution channel, and Walmart positions itself as a dominant force shaping retail strategy across the sector.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.\n- Depreciation, Amortization and Impairment Testing: Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical costs and depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years.\n\nAltria reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Altria performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Altria groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If Altria determines that an impairment exists, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. Altria also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.\n\nAltria conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require Altria to perform an interim review. Altria has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If necessary, Altria will perform a single step quantitative impairment test. Additionally, Altria has the option to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a reporting unit, but is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value in the period identified.\n\n- Derivative Financial Instruments: Altria enters into derivatives to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks, including foreign currency exchange rate risk. Altria uses various types of derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, options and swaps.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities. Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges at the inception of the contracts. For fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative, as well as the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item, are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings (losses) each period. For cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded each period in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) and are reclassified to the consolidated statements of earnings (losses) in the same periods in which operating results are affected by the respective hedged item. For net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign currency transaction gains or losses on a nonderivative hedging instrument are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. Such amounts remain in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the underlying foreign operations occurs for investments in foreign entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the respective hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, is expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated. Altria formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective, the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction and method for assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions, if it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge would no longer be considered effective and all of the derivative gains and losses would be recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings (losses) in the current period.\n\nFor financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments or do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings (losses) each period. Altria does not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n- Employee Benefit Plans: Altria provides a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits. Altria records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations",

DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.\n\n## Customer Warehouse\n\nSome of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and distribution centers, both company and third-party operated, to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover.\n\n## Distributor Networks\n\nWe distribute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective  when  greater  distribution  reach  can  be  achieved  by  including  a  wide  range  of  products  on  the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages and convenient foods  to restaurants,  businesses,  schools  and  stadiums  through  third-party  foodservice  and  vending distributors and operators.\n\n## E-commerce\n\nOur products are also available and sold directly to consumers on a growing number of company-owned and third-party e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.\n\n## Ingredients and Other Supplies\n\nThe  principal  ingredients  we  use  in  our  beverage  and  convenient  food  products  are  apple,  orange  and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, grapefruit, oranges and other fruits, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for convenient foods, aluminum, glass, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. In addition, we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and support the increased use of recycled content, including recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel, electricity and natural gas  are  also  important  commodities  for  our  businesses  due  to  their  use  in  our  and  our  business  partners' facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of  these  items  and  have  not  experienced  any  significant  continuous  shortages  that  would  prevent  us  from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use  of  fixed-price  contracts  and  purchase  orders,  pricing  agreements  and  derivative  instruments,  including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural  supply  chain,  including  the  development  of  our  initiative  to  advance  sustainable  farming practices  by  our  suppliers  and  expanding  it  further  globally.  During  2021,  we  experienced  higher  than anticipated  commodity,  packaging  and  other  input  costs  and,  in  some  instances,  limited  shortages  due  to global  inflation,  supply  chain  disruptions,  labor  shortages,  increased  demand  and  other  regulatory  and macroeconomic factors associated with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which has continued into  fiscal  2022.  See  Note  9  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further  information  on  how  we manage our exposure to commodity prices.",

          "chunk_text": "## Market Risk\n\nCounterparty Risk We predominantly work with financial institutions  with  strong  short-  and  long-term  credit  ratings  as  assigned  by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's. These banks are also part of a defined group of relationship banks. Non-investment grade institutions are only used in certain emerging markets to the extent required by local business needs. We have a conservative approach when it comes to choosing financial counterparties and financial instruments. As such we do not invest or hold investments in any structured or equity-linked products. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents is currently invested with maturities of less than 30 days.\n\nWe continuously monitor and assess the credit worthiness of all our counterparties.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments We operate in markets outside of the United States of America, with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations throughout the world. Consequently, we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency and interest rate  exposure. We use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nSee  Item  8,  Note  15. Financial  Instruments to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further  details  on  our  derivative  financial instruments and the related collateral arrangements.\n\nValue at Risk -We use a value at risk computation to estimate the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest-rate-sensitive and foreign currency price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. This computation includes our debt and foreign currency forwards, swaps and options. Anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the computation.\n\nThe computation estimates were made assuming normal market conditions, using a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period using a \"parametric delta-gamma\" approximation technique to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies and in calculating the risk of the underlying positions in the portfolio. These interrelationships were determined by  observing  interest  rate  and  forward  currency  rate  movements  primarily  over  the  preceding  quarter  for  determining  value  at  risk  at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and primarily over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average, high and low value at risk amounts during each year.\n\n",

Competition for, along with compensation and benefits expectations of, existing and prospective employees has increased, especially considering changing worker expectations and talent marketplace variability. In addition, the broader labor market is ex periencing a shortage of qualified talent, which has further increased the competition we face for qualified employees. We may not be able to successfully compete for, attract or retain the workforce that we want and may require for our future business needs, such as employees with advanced technology, artificial intelligence and digital marketing skills, and/or digital and analytics capabilities. Changes in laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate specialized technical, professional and management personnel to meet our business needs. In addition, the unexpected loss of experienced and specialized employees due to an increase in aggressive recruiting for best-in-class talent could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain specialized and/or top talent with diverse perspectives, experiences and backgrounds that reflect the broad range of consumers and markets we serve around the world; to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for our management team; to maintain a corporate culture that fosters innovation, collaboration and inclusion; or to design and successfully implement work models that meet the expectations of employees and prospective employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success.\n\n## Disruption of our supply chain, including increased commodity, raw material, packaging, energy, transportation and other input costs, may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\n\nAt times, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, disruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply chain. In connection with our manufacturing and bottling operations, we and our bottling partners are dependent upon, among other things, various ingredients and other raw materials and packaging materials. For additional information on the raw materials and supplies we use in our business, refer to the heading 'Raw Materials' set forth in Part I, 'Item 1. Business' of this report. Some of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are available from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. We and our bottling partners may not be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers, and our contingency plans may not be effective in preventing disruptions that may arise from shortages of any ingredients or other raw materials. Furthermore, some of our suppliers are located in countries experiencing political instability or other risks and/or unfavorable economic conditions. In addition, adverse and extreme weather conditions may affect the supply of agricultural commodities from which key ingredients for our products are derived. Any sustained or significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe and our independent bottlers operate a large fleet of trucks and other motor vehicles to distribute beverage products to customers. In addition, we and our independent bottlers use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources to operate production plants, bottling plants and distribution facilities. Increases in energy demand have in the past resulted, and could in the future result, in higher energy prices, impacting us and our independent bottlers.\n\nThe raw materials and other supplies, including ingredients, agricultural commodities, energy, fuel, packaging materials, transportation, labor and other supply chain inputs that we use for the production and distribution of our products, are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors. These factors include changes in supply and demand; supplier capacity constraints; a deterioration of our or our bottling partners' relationships with suppliers; international conflicts; political uncertainties; acts of terrorism; governmental instability; inflation; weather conditions (including the effects of climate change); hurricanes, wildfires, floods, droughts and other natural disasters; disease or pests (including the impact of citrus greening disease on the citrus industry); agricultural uncertainty; health epidemics, pandemics or other contagious outbreaks; cattle disease outbreaks (including avian flu); labor shortages, strikes or work stoppages; changes in or the enactment of new laws and regulations; governmental actions or controls or import/export restrictions, such as new, expanded or retaliatory tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers; port congestion or delays; transport capacity constraints; cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions; or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market, and the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation. We expect the inflationary pressures on certain input and other costs to continue to impact our business in 2025.\n\nOur attempts to offset cost pressures, such as through price increases of some of our products, may not be successful. Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forgo some purchases altogether. To the extent",

If we need to seek alternativ e sources of supply from v endors with whom we hav e less familiarity, the risk of these standards not being met may increase. Negativ e guest perceptions regarding the safety and sourcing of the products we sell could harm our reputation and adv ersely affect our results of operations.",

Coca-Cola identifies PepsiCo, Inc. as a primary global competitor across multiple markets, emphasizing direct rivalry in brand strength, distribution networks, and marketing capabilities. Philip Morris International includes PepsiCo, Inc. in its peer group based on global presence, consumer product focus, and comparable revenue and market capitalization.

We also sell products directly to businesses and consumers through v arious pure play e-retail platforms, retailer digital platforms, our direct-to-consumer websites and social media platforms. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net rev enues from continuing operations in 2024. For a discussion of long-term demographics, consumer trends and demand, refer to our Financial Outlook within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .\n\n## Distribution and Marketing\n\nOur  product  distribution  network  encompasses  direct  store  deliv ery,  company-owned  and  satellite  warehouses,  distribution  centers,  third  party distributors and other facilities. Additionally, we lev erage the serv ices of independent sales offices and agents in v arious international locations. T hrough our global digital commerce organization and capabilities, we pursue online growth with partners in key markets around the world, including both pure etailers and omni-channel retailers. We continue to inv est in adv ertising and consumer promotions, talent and digital capabilities. Our digital commerce channel strategies play a critical role in our ambition to be the global leader in snacking.\n\nOur marketing initiativ es are categorized in three principal sets of activ ities: (i) consumer marketing and adv ertising including digital and social media, onair , print, outdoor and other product promotions; (ii) consumer sales incentiv es such as coupons and rebates; and (iii) trade promotions to support price features, displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers.\n\n## Research, Development and Innovation\n\nOur  innov ation  and  new  product  dev elopment  objectiv es  include  continuous  improv ement  in  food  safety  and  quality,  growth  through  new  products, superior  consumer satisfaction  and  reduced  production  costs.  We  hav e  established  a  robust  framework  for  innov ation  to  driv e  a  technology  pipeline supporting the creation of new product bundles across short-, medium- and long-term horizons. These bundles enhance our portfolio to address ev olv ing consumer preferences and market trends, nutritional  needs  as  well  as  reduce  our  env ironmental  impact.  We  work  to  test  and  learn  new  ideas  and implement successful ones into other areas of our business. T o driv e growth, creativ ity, greater effectiv eness, improv ed efficiency and accelerated project deliv ery, we are focusing our technical research and dev elopment resources at technical centers around the globe.\n\nMindful snacking and sustainability are a significant focus of our current research and dev elopment initiativ es. We work to introduce new v arieties of our core products, including new taste or nutrition profiles that cater to ev olv ing consumer preferences, such as the launch in the UK of Cadbury Dairy Milk &amp; MORE , a multi-dimensional tablet designed to deliv er a richer, more indulgent eating experience, zero-sugar Oreo's in China and reduced sugar candies under The  Natural  Confectionary  Company brand  in Australia.  We  continue  to  expand  our  portfolio  of  cakes  and  pastries  in  new  markets  and  with updated formats including Milka brownies a nd Oreo cakes .\n\nWe  also  hav e  a  dedicated  innov ation  and  v enture  hub,  SnackFutures,  specifically  tailored  to  lev erage  emerging  consumer  trends  and  growth opportunities in mindful snacking. T he core objectiv es of this group are aligned with three key strategic areas: inv ent new brands and businesses, inv est in early-stage entrepreneurs and amplify SnackFutures' influence through the CoLab start-up engagement and mentoring programs built to equip startups with essential tools, technologies and expertise that can help them learn, grow and succeed.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe operate in highly competitiv e markets that are comprised of global, regional and local competitors, including new start-up brands and businesses. Some competitors have different profit objectiv es and inv estment time horizons than we do and therefore may approach pricing and promotional decisions differently.  We compete based on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, serv ice, product innov ation, taste, conv enience, nutritional v alue, the ability  to  identify  and  satisfy  consumer  preferences,  effectiv eness  of  our  digital  and  other  sales  and  marketing  strategies,  routes  to  market  and distribution  networks,  promotional  activ ities  and  price.  Our  adv antaged  global  footprint,  operating  scale  and  portfolio  of  brands  hav e  all  significantly contributed to building our market-leading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell.

While many of these arrangements improve efficiencies and decrease our operating costs, they also diminish our direct control. Such diminished control may lead to disruption in the distribution of our products and may have a material adverse effect on the quality and availability of products or services, our supply chain, and the speed and flexibility in our response to changing market conditions and adult consumer preferences, all of which may place us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons, including government regulations, and the distribution of our products may be disrupted in certain markets or our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with other partners or our own resources.\n\n## The effects of climate change, other environmental issues, and related legal or regulatory responses may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nWhile we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with environmental issues, such as climate change, by establishing environmental goals and standards and seeking business partners, including within our supply chain, that are committed to operating in ways that protect the environment or mitigate environmental impacts, we recognize that there are inherent environmental-related risks, including climate change-related risks, wherever business is conducted. Among other potential impacts, climate change could influence the quality and volume of the agricultural products we rely on, including tobacco, due to several factors beyond our control, including  more  frequent  variations  in  weather  patterns,  ex treme  weather  events  causing  unex pected  downtime  and  inventory  losses,  other  adverse  weather conditions, and governmental restrictions on trade, all of which may lead to disruption of operations at factories, warehouses and other premises.\n\nFurthermore, nature-related risks, including those related to natural ecosystems degradation, decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world, biodiversity loss, water resource depletion and deforestation, which are partially driven or exacerbated by climate change, may negatively impact the resilience of, or otherwise disrupt, our business operations or those of our suppliers and business partners.\n\nThere is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies on environmental policies, including those relating to climate change. New environmental-related legal or regulatory requirements may lead to additional carbon taxation, raw or other materials taxation, energy price increases, new compliance  costs,  increased  distribution  and  supply  chain  costs,  and  other  ex penses  impacting  our  cost  of  operations.  Moreover,  given  that  the  regulatory framework in this regard is highly dynamic, additional uncertainties may be driven by further upcoming regulatory changes on which we might have limited visibility or limited time to implement, which could have an impact on several elements of our business, including elevating the cost or complexity of our operations. Even if we make changes to align ourselves with legal or regulatory requirements, we may still be subject to significant penalties if such laws or regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices. Additionally, government authorities, non-governmental organizations or external stakeholders are increasingly filing lawsuits or initiating regulatory actions, alleging that public statements regarding sustainability-related matters and practices are misleading or false.\n\n## Government mandated prices, production control programs, and shifts in crops driven by economic conditions may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products.\n\nAs with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and the impacts of natural disasters and pandemics such as COVID-19. Tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. Changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to produce less tobacco or cloves. Any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business.\n\n## A prolonged disruption of our production facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nA prolonged disruption at or shut-down of one or more of the facilities where our products are produced, especially our ZYN production facility in Kentucky, U.S., which currently supplies substantially all of our capacity for ZYN sales in the U.S., due to natural- or man-made disasters or other events outside of our control, such as equipment malfunction or widespread outbreaks of acute illness, including COVID-19, supply chain constraints, or for any other reason, could limit our capacity to meet customer demands. Such an event could disrupt our operations; delay production, shipments and revenue; and result in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nSome leases include free-rent periods and step-rent provisions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nThe Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. Non-lease components and the lease components to which they relate are accounted for together as a single lease component for all asset classes. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. The lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. As the rate implicit  in  the  Company's  leases  is  not  easily  determinable,  the  present  value  of  the  sum  of  the  lease  payments  is calculated using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. Impairment of ROU assets is evaluated in a similar manner as described in Property and Equipment, net above.\n\nThe Company's asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that must be removed at the end of a lease. These obligations are generally recorded as a discounted liability, with an offsetting asset at the inception  of  the  lease  term,  based  upon  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  costs  to  remove  the  improvements.  These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same  depreciation method  as  the leasehold improvement  assets  and  are  included with buildings  and improvements.  Estimated  ARO  liabilities  associated  with  these  leases  are  included  in  other  liabilities  in  the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization.  The  Company  reviews  goodwill  annually  in  the  fourth  quarter  for  impairment  or  when  circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income approach estimates fair  value  based  on  expected  discounted  future  cash  flows,  while  the  market  approach  uses  comparable  public companies and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\n\nGoodwill  is  included  in  other  long-term  assets  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.

ROU assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the lease liability, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received and initial direct costs incurred. Lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. The non-recurring fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 as no fair value inputs are observable. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our countryspecific incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term using information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Many of our leases contain non-lease components (e.g. product costs, common-area or other maintenance costs) that relate to the lease components of the agreement. Nonlease components and the lease components to which they relate are accounted for as a single lease component.\n\nAmortization of ROU lease assets is calculated on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the expense recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the leased item. Interest expense is recorded over the lease term and is recorded in interest expense (based on a front-loaded interest expense pattern) for finance leases and is recorded in cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses (on a straight-line basis) for operating leases. All operating lease cash payments and interest on finance leases are recorded within cash flows from operating activities and all finance lease principal payments are recorded within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Software Costs:\n\nWe capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed seven years.\n\n## Goodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangible Assets:\n\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on July 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit's fair value using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. In 2021, we performed a quantitative annual test. For our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a marketbased, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.4% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations, and for our Latin America and AMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.4%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, industry and economic conditions, and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.\n\nAnnually we assess indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these intangible assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We determine estimated fair value using estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, we consider the asset impaired and reduce its carrying value to the estimated fair value. We amortize definite-life intangible assets over their estimated useful lives and evaluate them for impairment as we do other long-lived assets.",

          "chunk_text": "Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied. Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, e-vapor and oral nicotine products. Our performance obligations are typically satisfied upon shipment or delivery to our customers. PMI estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience, and these estimates are immaterial. Estimated costs associated with warranty programs for IQOS devices are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized, based on a number of factors, including historical ex perience, product failure rates and warranty policies. The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration where applicable. Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to  be  entitled  to  under  the  terms  of  the  contracts  with  customers,  historical  ex perience  of  discount  or  rebate  redemption,  where  relevant,  and  the  terms  of  any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories evolve.\n\nGoodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets V aluation We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review, using either a qualitative or quantitative assessment for each of our reporting units. Where a qualitative assessment is followed, we determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists based on qualitative factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and competitive  conditions,  legal  and  regulatory  environment,  historical  financial  performance  and  significant  changes  within  the  reporting  unit.  If  the  qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. The quantitative impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value. If the carrying value ex ceeds the fair value, goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we use the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global companies within the tobacco industry and a discounted cash flow model. To determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets, we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method. These discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for  forecasting  operating  cash  flows,  which  are  subject  to  changes  in  business  conditions,  such  as  volumes  and  prices,  costs  to  produce,  discount  rates  and estimated capital needs. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated, and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, PMI completed its annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment. We performed a quantitative impairment assessment for all of our reporting units and non-amortizable intangible assets with the exception of the three reporting units and nonamortizable intangible asset related to the Swedish Match segment for which we have performed a qualitative assessment. Based on this review, it was determined that the estimated fair value of the Wellness and Healthcare reporting unit was lower than its carrying value. Consequently, PMI recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $665 million. Additionally, as a result of the impairment test of non-amortizable intangible assets, PMI recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $15 million. There was no impairment charge of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for our other reporting units. For additional information, see Item 8, Note 5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net .\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, PMI completed its annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment using a quantitative assessment for all of its reporting units and non-amortizable intangible assets. As a result of this review, no impairment charges were required.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our goodwill was $16.6 billion, which is related to eleven geographical reporting units, each consisting of a group of markets with similar operating and economic characteristics, and the Wellness and Healthcare business. The estimated fair value of each of our twelve reporting units and non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value as of December 31, 2024.\n\nInvestment in non-marketable equity securities -For  further  details,  see  Item  8,  Note  6. Related  Parties  -  Equity  Investments  and  Other to  our  consolidated financial statements\n\nMarketing  Costs  We  incur  certain  costs  to  support  our  products  through  programs  that  include  advertising,  marketing,  consumer  engagement  and  trade promotions. The costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program.  For  volume-based  incentives  provided  to  customers,  management  continually  assesses  and  estimates,  by  customer,  the  likelihood  of  the  customer's achieving the specified targets, and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made. For other trade promotions, management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position, results of operations or operating cash flows.",

          "chunk_text": "## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nManagement reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. G oodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that ex pected economic benefits will be provided.\n\nGoodwill is typically assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in ex cess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches. Management has performed its evaluation and determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill during fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.\n\nThe following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2025 and 2024:\n\n",

      "answer": "Argentina played a significant role in the Latin American performance of Colgate-Palmolive, Mondelez, and Procter & Gamble in 2023. CL reported strong organic sales growth in Latin America, led by Argentina, driven by pricing increases and volume growth across Oral, Personal, and Home Care categories. MDLZ noted foreign exchange transaction costs due to Argentina's currency volatility, which negatively impacted gross profit and contributed to unfavorable currency changes decreasing operating income by $190 million. PG disclosed a restructuring of its operations in Argentina as part of a broader Enterprise Markets portfolio review, citing the 'substantial liquidation of operations' and recognizing accumulated foreign currency translation losses.

      "answer": "COST includes the U.K. as one of its key international markets within its reportable segments, indicating that it operates wholly owned subsidiaries there as part of its global membership warehouse strategy. PM highlights the U.K. as a market where voluntary standards for heat-not-burn products are in place and where a scientific assessment by the U.K. Committee on Toxicity concluded that such products are likely less harmful than traditional cigarettes, which supports PM\u2019s harm-reduction narrative. WMT notes that its U.K. operations contributed to improved margin mix in fiscal 2021 and were classified as held for sale at the end of fiscal 2021, with depreciation and amortization ceasing prior to their eventual divestiture in fiscal 2022. Together, these perspectives show that the U.K. plays a diverse and meaningful role across retail and tobacco sectors, influencing operational decisions, regulatory engagement, and financial performance strategies.",

The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Effective for fiscal 2022, stock-based compensation was allocated to the segments in this reporting. This change reflected a decision to evaluate the financial performance of the segments inclusive of this expense. Operating income was restated in each of the segments for all prior periods to reflect this change.\n\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "FDA actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments.\n\nOn  September  29,  2021,  the  International  Trade  Commission  (\"ITC\")  issued  its  Final  Determination  (\"FD\"),  Limited  Exclusion  Order (\"LEO\") and Cease and Desist Order (\"CDO\"). The ITC upheld the finding of infringement in the ID and found a subsequent violation. The ITC issued a LEO prohibiting the importation of infringing tobacco heating articles and components thereof and cease and desist orders against Philip Morris USA, Inc. and Altria Client Services, LLC, which went into effect at the end of the 60-day Presidential review period on November 28, 2021. We have appealed the patent issues. Furthermore, lawsuits based on the same patent families have been repeatedly and universally rejected in European courts and the European Patent Office. The decision has no bearing outside the United States.\n\nUntil  recently,  there  were  no  countries  with  specific  product  standards  for  heat-not-burn  products.  Currently,  national  standards  setting minimum  quality  and  safety  requirements  for  such  products  have  been  adopted  in  several  countries  with  technical  heat-not-burn specifications and/or methods for demonstrating the absence of combustion. They are mandatory in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, the UAE, Uzbekistan and Bahrain, and voluntary in Armenia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Vietnam, the  U.K.  and  Ukraine.  In  Japan,  a  voluntary  standard  sets  minimum  safety  requirements  for  tobacco  heating  devices.  We  expect  other governments to consider similar product standards and encourage making them mandatory.\n\nAll EU member states have transposed the EU Tobacco Products Directive, including the provisions on novel tobacco products, such as heated  tobacco  units,  and  e-cigarettes.  Most  of  the  EU  member  states  require  a  notification  submitted  six  months  before  the  intended placing on the market of such products, while some require pre-market authorizations for the introduction of such products. To date, we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of our Platform 1 product in over 20 member states.\n\nIn addition, in Italy, in April 2018, we submitted an application for HEETS , used with the IQOS device, requesting regulatory recognition of the  reduction  of  toxic  substances  and  potential  risk  reduction  resulting  from  switching  to  this  product  compared  to  continued  cigarette smoking. In January 2019, our application was not granted primarily on the grounds of insufficient data and questions of methodology.  Due to the constraints of the review process, we had been unable to supplement the application with all the data we subsequently filed with the FDA and to address methodological questions during the review. We plan to submit a new application where we will clarify the concerns raised by the decision and further strengthen our application by submitting additional evidence that became available since we submitted our first application, consistent with our FDA filings. We are confident that our evidence supports our application.\n\nOn October 31, 2019, our Australian subsidiary, Philip Morris Limited ('PML'), submitted an application to the Scheduling Committee of the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia ('TGA') seeking to exempt heated tobacco products from being prohibited in Australia. In August 2020, the TGA issued its decision denying the application and stating that it did not present compelling evidence to establish a public health benefit from greater access to nicotine in heated tobacco products.\n\nTo date, several governmental agencies have published their scientific findings that analyze the harm-reduction potential of certain RRPs versus continuing smoking, including:\n\nIn December 2017, at the request of the U.K. Department of Health and Public Health England, the U.K. Committee on Toxicity published its assessment of the risk of heat-not-burn products relative to cigarette smoking. This assessment included analysis of scientific data for two  heat-not-burn  products,  one  of  which  was  our  Platform  1  product.  The  assessment  concluded  that,  while  still  harmful  to  health, compared with the known risks from cigarettes, heat-not-burn products are probably less harmful. Subsequently, in February 2018, Public Health England published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heat-not-burn products may be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than e-cigarettes.\n\nIn May 2018, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment ('BfR') published a study on the Platform 1 aerosol relative to cigarette smoke using the Health Canada Intense Smoking Regimen. BfR found reductions in selected HPHCs in a range of 80-99%. This publication indicates that significant reductions in the levels of selected toxicants are likely to reduce toxicant exposure, which BfR stated might be regarded as a discrete benefit compared to combustible cigarettes.\n\nIn May 2018, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment ('RIVM') published a factsheet on novel tobacco products that heat rather than burn tobacco, focusing on our Platform 1 product. RIVM analyzed the aerosol generated by our Platform 1 product and concluded that the use of this product, while still harmful to health, is probably less harmful than continued smoking.",

For fiscal 2022, the reduction in net sales was driven by a $32.6 billion decrease primarily related to the divestitures of Asda and Seiyu, which closed during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This decrease was partially offset by positive comparable sales in most of our remaining markets, as well as positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $4.5 billion. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets driven by changes in consumer behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $5.0 billion. The pandemic led to significant economic pressures and channel and mix shifts due to changes in consumer behavior, including accelerated growth in eCommerce in several markets. While several of our markets experienced extensive store and operational closures in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 as a result of government mandates, most closed stores and warehouses had resumed operations by the third quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nGross profit rate decreased 55 basis points and increased 50 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the decrease was primarily driven by shifts into lower margin formats and the impact related to our divested markets. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to Flipkart's improved margin mix and reduced fuel sales in the U.K.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 71 basis points and increased 14 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2022 was primarily due to impacts from the divested markets and $0.4 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from depreciation and amortization expense not having been recorded for our operations in the U.K. and Japan subsequent to their held for sale classification at the end of fiscal 2021 and prior to closing during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to $0.5 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and lapping a $0.4 billion non-cash impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2020.\n\nOperating income for fiscal 2022 included a $0.3 billion impact from positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and fiscal 2021 included a $0.2 billion impact from negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.1 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive targets an asset allocation of approximately 60% in fixed income, 26% in equity securities, and 14% in other investments for its U.S. pension plans. Coca-Cola, on the other hand, uses a forward-looking approach based on asset class correlations and historical returns, with an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75% for its U.S. pension plan assets. Mondelez takes a more conservative stance by using buy-in annuity contracts to cover all liabilities in the MDLZ Global Plan and rebalancing monthly to maintain its target allocation. These differences indicate that CL balances risk across asset classes, KO emphasizes forward-looking asset modeling, and MDLZ reduces funded status risk through annuitization and active rebalancing.",

The assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 6.50% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. In determining the expected long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans' investments and the historical rate of return.\n\nAverage annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 5%, 2%, 4%, 6% and 5%, respectively. In addition, the current assumed rate of return for the U.S. plans is based upon the nature of the plans' investments with a target asset allocation of approx imately 60% in fix ed income securities, 26% in equity securities and 14% in other investments. A 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $11. A 1% change in the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans and the other U.S. retiree benefit plan would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $1 and $2, respectively. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase for the pension plans, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the ex pected long-term rate of return. This rate was 3.50% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 9, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company's pension and other postretirement plans.\n\n- The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits (other than the discount rate noted above) is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase for the U.S. postretirement benefit plans is 7.00% for 2025, declining to 5.00% by 2030 and remaining at 4.50% for the years thereafter. A 1% change in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $2.\n- The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units (both performance-based and timevested), based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton ('Black-Scholes') option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended December 31, 2024 was $22.65. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. These assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and ex pected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. A one-year change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 7%. A 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 4%. The Company uses a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units at the date of grant. The Monte-Carlo simulation model uses substantially the same inputs as the Black-Scholes model.\n- Goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the Company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. In assessing impairment, the Company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis.",

The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities. Plan obligations are determined by applying projected cash flows to the individual spot rates from the yield curve. The disclosed discount rate is the rate that would produce the same obligation as the applicable yield curve. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected benefit cash flows, or for other non-U.S. plans referenced above, this is measured using the discount rate derived from appropriate indices. The rate of compensation increase assumption is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews.\n\nThe cash balance interest crediting rate for the U.S. qualified pension plan is based on the yield on six -month U.S. Treasury bills on the last day of September of the previous plan year, plus 150 basis points, with a minimum interest crediting rate of 3.80% for all active employees and certain former employees. The Company assumes that the ultimate interest crediting rate is 140 basis points lower than the plan's year-end discount rate and that the current interest crediting rate will converge with the ultimate interest crediting rate after a period of 10 years.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is determined using forward-looking assumptions in the context of historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as correlations among asset classes. We evaluate the ex pected long-term rate of return assumption on an annual basis. The expected long-term rate of return assumption used in computing 2024 net periodic benefit income for the U.S. pension plans was 6.75%. As of December 31, 2024, the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year annualized return for the U.S. pension plan assets was 3.7%, 5.5% and 7.1%, respectively.
