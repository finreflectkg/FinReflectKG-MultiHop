('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

          "chunk_text": "with Ukraine related assets held by other subsidiaries, account for less than 1% of net assets as of June 30, 2022.\n\nOur Russia business includes two manufacturing sites with a net book value of approximately $350 million as of June 30, 2022.  We  have  approximately  2,400  employees,  including both manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. In fiscal  2022,  our  operations  in  Russia  accounted  for  less  than 2% of consolidated net sales and less than 1% of net earnings. Additionally, net assets of our Russia subsidiaries, along with Russia  related  assets  held  by  other  subsidiaries,  account  for less than 2% of net assets as of June 30, 2022. Beginning in March 2022, the Company has reduced its product portfolio, discontinued  new  capital  investments  and  suspended  media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia.\n\nFuture impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the  high  level  of  uncertainty  as  to  how  the  war  will  evolve, what  its  duration  will  be  and  its  ultimate  resolution.  Within Ukraine, there is a possibility of physical  damage  and destruction of our two manufacturing facilities. We may not be able to operate our manufacturing  sites  and  source  raw materials  from  our  suppliers  or  ship  finished  products  to  our customers. Ultimately, these could result in impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed assets or write-downs of other operating assets and working capital.\n\nWithin  Russia,  we  may  not  be  able  to  continue  our  reduced operations  at  current  levels  due  to  sanctions  and  countersanctions, monetary, currency or payment controls, restrictions on access to financial institutions and supply and transportation challenges. Our suppliers, distributors and retail customers  are  also  impacted  by  the  war  and  their  ability  to successfully  maintain  their  operations  could  also  impact  our operations or negatively impact the sales of our products.\n\nMore  broadly,  there  could  be  additional  negative  impacts  to our  net  sales,  earnings  and  cash  flows  should  the  situation escalate  beyond  its  current  scope,  including,  among  other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures and supply chain  cost  increases  or  the  geographic  proximity  of  the  war relative to the rest of Europe.\n\nFor  additional  information  on  risk  factors  that  could  impact our results, please refer to 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results  of  operations  include  net  sales,  gross  margin,  selling, general  and  administrative  costs  (SG&amp;A),  operating  margin, other non-operating items, income taxes and net earnings. The primary  factors  driving  year-over-year  changes  in  net  sales include  overall  market  growth  in  the  categories  in  which  we compete,  product  initiatives,  competitive  activities  (the  level of  initiatives,  pricing  and  other  activities  by  competitors), marketing spending, retail executions (both in-store and online)  and  acquisition  and  divestiture  activity,  all  of  which drive  changes  in  our  underlying  unit  volume,  as  well  as  our pricing  actions  (which  can  also  impact  volume),  changes  in product and geographic mix and foreign exchange impacts on sales outside the U.S.\n\nFor  most  of  our  categories,  our  cost  of  products  sold  and SG&amp;A are variable in nature to some extent. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily  on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in North America are  generally  higher  than  the  Company  average  for similar products),  product  mix  (for  example,  the  Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the  underlying  sales),  the  impacts  of  manufacturing  savings projects  and  reinvestments  (for  example,  product  or  package improvements) and, to a lesser extent, scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature).  The primary components  of  SG&amp;A  are  marketing-related  costs  and  nonmanufacturing  overhead  costs.  Marketing-related  costs  are primarily  variable  in  nature,  although  we  may  achieve  some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing  efficiencies.  While  overhead  costs  are  variable  to some  extent, we  generally experience more  scale-related impacts  for  these  costs  due  to  our  ability  to  leverage  our organization  and  systems'  infrastructures  to  support  business growth. The main drivers of changes in SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments  (for  example,  increased  advertising),  inflation, foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts.\n\nFor  a  detailed  discussion  of  the  fiscal  2021  year-over-year changes,  please  refer  to  the  MD&amp;A  in  Part  II,  Item  7  of  the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.\n\n## Net Sales\n\nNet sales increased 5% to $80.2 billion in fiscal 2022 on a 2% increase  in  unit  volume  versus  the  prior  year.  Unfavorable foreign exchange decreased net sales by 2%. Favorable pricing had a 4% positive impact on net sales. Mix increased net sales by 1% due to positive geographic mix from the disproportionate  growth  of  the  North  America  region  and positive category mix from the disproportionate growth of the Personal Health Care category, both of which have higher than Company-average selling prices. This was partially offset  by the disproportionate growth of the Fabric Care business, which has lower than Company-average selling prices. Excluding the net impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures,  organic  sales  grew  7%  on  a  2%  increase  in organic  volume.  Net  sales  increased  high  single  digits  in Health  Care,  increased  mid-single  digits  in  Fabric  &amp;  Home Care and in Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care and increased low single digits in Beauty and Grooming.\n\nOn  a  regional  basis,  volume  increased  mid-single  digits  in North America and Latin America, increased low single digits in Asia Pacific and IMEA. Volume in Europe was unchanged and decreased mid-single digits in Greater China.",

      "question": "How does MO's investment risk in Cronos, influenced by compliance with anti-money laundering laws, compare to WMT's exposure to similar regulatory risks in its international operations?",
      "answer": "MO's investment risk in Cronos is tied to Cronos's compliance with anti-money laundering laws, particularly in the U.S., where failure to comply could result in criminal, civil, or tax liability, negatively affecting MO's financial position and reputation. This risk is compounded by Cronos's involvement in cannabis-related businesses across international jurisdictions, which are subject to evolving and often stringent regulatory environments. Similarly, WMT faces exposure to anti-money laundering laws across its global operations, especially in countries like Canada, Mexico, and India, where it must navigate complex regulatory frameworks as part of its international retail and eCommerce activities. Both companies face potential financial and reputational harm due to regulatory non-compliance, though MO\u2019s exposure is more specific to Cronos\u2019s cannabis-related legal risks, while WMT\u2019s is broader and tied to its extensive global retail footprint.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MO \u2192 Cronos: MO discloses its investment in Cronos and highlights the legal, regulatory, and reputational risks associated with Cronos\u2019s cannabis business, including U.S. anti-money laundering laws.",
        "Hop 2: Cronos \u2192 Anti-Money Laundering Laws: Cronos operates under U.S. laws such as the Controlled Substances Act and anti-money laundering regulations, non-compliance with which could lead to liability for both Cronos and MO.",
        "Hop 3: WMT \u2190 Anti-Money Laundering Laws: WMT explicitly states that its international operations are subject to anti-money laundering laws and that non-compliance by associates or agents could lead to fines, penalties, and reputational damage."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nmaterial non-cash impairment of our e-vapor reporting unit's goodwill or related definite-lived intangible assets (carrying value of $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2024), or both, in future periods. Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

If the carrying value of our investment in ABI exceeds its fair value and we determine that the loss in value is other than temporary, we record appropriate impairment losses. In a prior period, we concluded that the fair value of our investment in ABI declined below the carrying value of our investment in ABI and that this decline in fair value was other than temporary. As a result, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge for that period. It is possible that we may be required to record significant impairment charges in the future and, if we do so, our net earnings and carrying value of our investment in ABI could be materially adversely affected.\n\nIn the event that our ownership percentage in ABI were to decrease below certain levels, (i) we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, (ii) the number of nominees that we have the right to select for election to the ABI board of directors could be reduced and (iii) we may be unable to continue to account for our investment in ABI under the equity method of accounting.\n\n## Our investment in Cronos subjects us to certain risks associated with Cronos's business, including legal, regulatory and reputational risks.\n\nOur investment in Cronos, a Canadian cannabinoid company, subjects us to various risks relating to Cronos's business, such as legal, regulatory and reputational risks. Cronos is engaged in the cultivation, manufacture and marketing of cannabis and cannabis-derived products for the medical and adult-use markets in various international jurisdictions. Accordingly, Cronos's operations are subject to laws, regulations and guidelines promulgated by various governmental authorities. In the United States, these laws include the Controlled Substances Act, the Civil Assets Forfeiture Reform Act (as it relates to violation of the Controlled Substances Act), all related applicable anti-money laundering laws and FDA regulations. A failure by Cronos or Altria to comply with applicable laws, including cannabis laws, could result in criminal, civil or tax  liability, negative impacts on the availability and cost of capital and credit or reputational harm for Altria.\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 1C. Cybersecurity.\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe rely extensively on information technology, much of which is managed by third-party service providers (such as cloud data service providers), to support a variety of business processes and activities, including: complying with regulatory, legal, financial reporting and tax  requirements; engaging in marketing and ecommerce activities; managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations; researching, developing, manufacturing and distributing our products; collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information; and communicating with employees, investors, suppliers, trade customers, adult tobacco consumers and others. Recognizing the critical importance of cybersecurity in today's digital landscape, we are committed to safeguarding our information assets, protecting consumer data and maintaining the integrity and availability of our systems. Accordingly, we have implemented an extensive cybersecurity risk management framework designed to identify, assess, mitigate and prevent potential cybersecurity risks and to align with industry best practices and all applicable regulatory requirements. We leverage the National Institute of Standards and Technology ('NIST') Cybersecurity Framework and industry best practices to identify and prioritize cybersecurity risks based on their potential impacts. We also use the NIST framework and industry best practices to drive enhancements to our program that are designed to protect our assets and third-party partners. The NIST framework also helps us maintain ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements. We align our security standards for infrastructure configuration with the Center for Internet Security's Benchmarks, which are prescriptive recommendations based upon the consensus of global cybersecurity experts.\n\nOur framework is built around the following key principles: (i) risk assessment and threat intelligence; (ii) security controls; (iii) incident response; (iv) employee awareness and training; and (v) third-party risk management. We have integrated our cybersecurity framework into our broad enterprise risk management processes, which allows us to leverage our existing enterprise-wide experience in managing risk and adapting to change in the cybersecurity threat landscape.\n\n- Risk Assessment and Threat Intelligence: We conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats. Our Information Technology ('IT') Risk Management function, overseen by our Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO'), leads internal self-assessments, which involve evaluating the security posture of critical systems, networks and applications as well as the potential impact of cybersecurity threats on our business operations, financial condition and reputation. IT Risk Management also conducts ongoing threat monitoring and has implemented monitoring systems, including technologies such as intrusion detection systems, security information and event management tools and threat intelligence programs.\n\nWe regularly engage third-party consulting services to conduct audits and assessments of the effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls and processes and identify areas for improvement based on developments in industry best practices. We typically engage these services",

Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.\n\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores, clubs and eCommerce platforms around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our results of operations.\n\n## Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks\n\nOur international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.\n\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we operate retail and eCommerce businesses in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.\n\nDuring fiscal 2025, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions; legal and regulatory constraints, such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as in India; restrictive governmental actions, such as trade protection measures or nationalization; antitrust and competition law regulatory matters, such as those underway in Canada, Mexico and India (relating to our Flipkart subsidiary); local product safety and environmental laws; tax regulations; local labor laws; anti-money laundering laws and regulations; trade policies; foreign ex change or currency regulations; laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection; and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.\n\nChanging our operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade or newly imposed sanctions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and we may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. In addition, tensions between nation-state governments and conflicts of laws may lead to challenges for our operations. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response, or consumer boycotts in certain regions, could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could also adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they recur, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also ex ist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, geopolitical tensions or events, laws and regulations.\n\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or U.S. sanctions laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries. Our global policies designed to regulate such business practices and our global compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations may not be adequate to prevent the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are appropriately regulated by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could subject us to fines and penalties and adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.",

      "answer": "Costco disclosed that as of August 28, 2022, it held no Level 1 or Level 3 financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, indicating minimal use of highly liquid financial instruments like exchange-traded derivatives. In contrast, PepsiCo actively uses exchange-traded commodity futures, which are classified as Level 1 financial assets, and these futures are cash-settled daily, reflecting a more active approach to managing commodity price risk. This suggests that while both companies manage financial risks, PepsiCo employs more direct market-based hedging instruments, whereas Costco appears to avoid such instruments or uses alternative methods not captured in recurring fair value measurements.",

See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our asset derivatives is recorded within other current assets and other assets and the fair value of our liability derivatives is recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Non-cash changes in unrealized gains and losses related to our unsettled derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items, net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated, and those that are economic hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Currency movements related to our non-U.S. debt and our net investments in non-U.S. operations, as well as the related deferred taxes, are recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.\n\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.\n\nCommodity derivatives . We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nCurrency exchange derivatives . We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.

Since Coca-Cola HBC is a major independent bottler representing 41% of The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s total worldwide unit case volume in 2021 and operates in Belarus, any operational constraints or economic instability in Belarus could reduce its production and distribution capacity.

We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

We  do  not  believe  such legislation has had a material effect on the price of our shares.\n\nPMI is also subject to various Trade Sanctions imposed by the EU and other jurisdictions (\"Trade Sanctions\"). We comply fully with these Trade Sanctions.\n\nThe EU imposed new sanctions regarding the Republic of Belarus (\"Belarus\") on June 21, 2021, including the designation of additional EU sanctions targets  (individuals  and  legal  entities)  in  Belarus.  On  June  24,  2021,  the  EU  council  introduced  additional  sectoral  economic sanctions  aimed  at  specific  sectors  of  the  Belarus  economy,  including  restrictions  on  the  trade  of  goods  used  for  the  production  or manufacture of tobacco products. Subsequently, six non-EU countries (Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Albania) announced that they 'aligned themselves' with the EU sanctions of June 21. On July 6, 2021, Switzerland imposed sanctions on Belarusian individuals and legal entities effective July 7, 2021. The Swiss sanctions are similar in scope to the EU sanctions of June 21, 2021.\n\nFurther, on August 9, 2021, the U.K. introduced sectoral economic sanctions similar in scope to the EU sectoral sanctions of June 24, 2021. Also on August 9, 2021, the U.S. imposed blocking sanctions on certain individuals and entities pursuant to an Executive Order adding them to the list  of  Specially  Designated  Nationals  and  Blocked  Persons  (the  \"SDN  List\")  issued  by  the  U.S.  Department  of Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control (\"OFAC\"). The Executive Order expanded the bases for the imposition of sanctions, including, among others, by authorizing the imposition by OFAC of blocking sanctions on persons operating in the tobacco sector of the Belarus economy, as well as for providing material support or assistance to any SDN. In December 2021, the U.S., the EU, the U.K. and Canada amended their respective sanctions lists by including additional Belarusian individuals, entities, and aircraft.\n\nPMI complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including sanctions, in the markets where it operates. We have taken appropriate actions in response to the latest sanctions to ensure full compliance with the relevant restrictions.\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nThe following discussion compares operating results within each of our geographical segments and Other category for 2021 with 2020.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, references to total industry, total market, our shipment volume and our market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units.

      "answer": "KO uses the Black-Scholes-Merton model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards, with the weighted-average fair value of options granted in 2023 being calculated using assumptions such as volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected term. These weighted-average assumptions are a key input in the model. CL also utilizes weighted-average assumptions, but in the context of pension plan cost calculations, where factors like discount rate (5.66% in 2023), expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (6.25% in 2023), and compensation increase (3.50% in 2023) directly impact the reported net periodic benefit cost. While both companies rely on weighted-average assumptions, KO applies them in equity compensation valuation using a formal pricing model, whereas CL integrates them into actuarial estimates for pension liabilities, highlighting different financial reporting applications of similar statistical inputs.",

        "Hop 1: KO \u2192 Black-Scholes-Merton Model: KO discloses using this model to estimate the fair value of stock options, with specific weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation for 2023 grants.",

      "answer": "MDLZ's Argentine operations contributed $401 million (1.4% of consolidated net revenues) in 2021 and carried a remeasurement loss of $13 million due to inflationary pressures. KO, while not directly exposed to Argentina's inflation, depends on Coca-Cola FEMSA, which operates in Argentina, as one of KO's top bottlers, contributing significantly to KO's $14,471 million in net sales to equity method investees in 2021. Thus, while MDLZ bears direct financial risk from Argentina's economic conditions, KO's exposure is indirect through its reliance on a bottler that operates in the country.",

During the second quarter of 2018, primarily based on published estimates that indicated Argentina's threeyear cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%, we concluded that Argentina became a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes. As of July 1, 2018, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our Argentinean subsidiaries and changed their functional currency from the Argentinean peso to the U.S. dollar. On July 1, 2018, both monetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Argentinean pesos were remeasured into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, with remeasurement and other transaction gains and losses recorded in net earnings. As of December 31, 2021, our Argentinean operations had $9 million of Argentinean peso denominated net monetary assets. Our Argentinean operations contributed $401 million, or 1.4% of consolidated net revenues in 2021. We recorded a remeasurement loss of $13 million in 2021, a remeasurement loss of $9 million in 2020 and a remeasurement gain of $4 million in 2019 within selling, general and administrative expenses related to the revaluation of the Argentinean peso denominated net monetary position over these periods.\n\nBrexit . Following the separation of the United Kingdom from the European Union ('Brexit') in 2020, a new trade arrangement was reached between the U.K. and E.U. that began on January 1, 2021. The main trade provisions include the continuation of no tariffs or quotas on trade between the U.K. and E.U. subject to prescribed trade terms, including but not limited to meeting product and labeling standards for both the U.K. and E.U. Cross-border trade between the U.K. and E.U. is also subject to new customs regulations, documentation and reviews. To comply with the new requirements, we increased resources in customer service and logistics, in our factories, and on our customs support teams. We adapted our processes and systems for the new and increased number of customs transactions. We continue to closely monitor and manage our inventory levels of imported raw materials, packaging and finished goods in the U.K. We have made investments in resources, systems and processes to meet the new ongoing requirements and we work to mitigate disruptions to our local supply chain and distribution, including those related to the recent transportation labor shortage in the U.K., to reduce the impact on our input and distribution costs. Despite our efforts to control costs, we have seen inflationary cost pressures rise in our U.K. business this year, as we have also experienced in other markets. If the U.K.'s separation from, or new trade arrangements with, the E.U. negatively impact the U.K. economy or result in disagreements on trade terms, delays affecting our supply chain or distribution, disruptions to sales or collections, or further increases in inflationary cost pressures, the impact to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be material. In 2021, we generated 9.3% of our net revenues in the U.K.\n\nOther Countries . Since we sell our products in over 150 countries and have operations in approximately 80 countries, we monitor economic and currency-related risks and seek to take protective measures in response to these exposures. We continue to monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts to our `business operations, currencies and net monetary exposures. Since the global onset of COVID-19 in early 2020, most countries in which we do business experienced periods of significant economic uncertainty as well as exchange rate volatility. At this time, except for Argentina which is accounted for as a highly inflationary economy, we do not anticipate any other countries in which we operate to be at risk of becoming highly inflationary economies.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash:\n\nCash and cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. We also had restricted cash within other current assets of $7 million as of December 31, 2021 and $31 million as of December 31, 2020.

Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 42 percent of U.S. unit case volume. Unit case volume outside the United States represented 83 percent of the Company's worldwide unit case volume in 2021. The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 48 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\n\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

      "answer": "Altria's investment in Cronos exposes it to anti-money laundering (AML) risks because Cronos operates in the cannabis industry, which is subject to U.S. AML laws due to its involvement in controlled substances. A failure by Cronos to comply with these laws could result in criminal, civil, or tax liability for Altria. Similarly, Walmart must comply with AML and sanctions regimes in both the U.S. and other countries through its financial services offerings, such as money transfers and prepaid access. Noncompliance by Walmart could result in fines, sanctions, and reputational harm. Both companies face significant regulatory exposure under AML laws, though through different business activities\u2014Cronos through cannabis-related financial risks and Walmart through its financial services operations.",

      "answer": "PepsiCo generated 29% of its beverage revenue from the Africa, Middle East, and South Asia (AMESA) region in 2023, indicating a significant international presence in this sector. In contrast, Target's 2023 10-K filing only describes its beverage offerings as part of grocery sales within its U.S. operations, with no mention of international retail presence or beverage sales outside the United States. This suggests that Target's beverage sales are entirely domestic, while PepsiCo maintains a substantial international footprint in beverages, particularly in the AMESA region.",

Selection of the targeted asset allocation for U.S. pension plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes. Our target allocation is a mix of 42 percent equity investments, 30 percent fixed-income investments and 28 percent alternative investments. We believe this target allocation will enable us to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:\n\n- (1) optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk;\n- (2) maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers; and\n- (3) maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class.\n\nThe guidelines that have been established with each investment manager provide parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable. Investment managers agree to obtain written approval for deviations from stated investment style or guidelines. As of December 31, 2021, no investment manager was responsible for more than 8 percent of total U.S. pension plan assets.\n\nOur target allocation of 42 percent equity investments is composed of 60 percent global equities, 16 percent emerging market equities and 24 percent domestic small-cap and mid-cap equities. Optimal returns through our investments in global equities are achieved through security selection as well as country and sector diversification. Investments in our common stock accounted for approximately 5 percent of total global equities and approximately 3 percent of total U.S. pension plan assets. Our investments in global equities are intended to provide diversified exposure to both U.S. and non-U.S. equity markets. Our investments in both emerging market equities and domestic small-cap and mid-cap equities may experience large swings in their market value. Our investments in these asset classes are selected based on capital appreciation potential.\n\nOur target allocation of 30 percent fixed-income investments is composed of 33 percent long-duration bonds and 67 percent with multi-strategy alternative credit managers. Long-duration bonds are intended to provide a stable rate of return through investments in high-quality publicly traded debt securities. Our investments in long-duration bonds are diversified in order to mitigate duration and credit exposure. Multi-strategy alternative credit managers invest in a combination of high-yield bonds, bank loans, structured credit and emerging market debt. These investments are in lower-rated and non-rated debt securities, which generally produce higher returns compared to long-duration bonds and also help to diversify our overall fixed-income portfolio.\n\nOur target allocation for alternative investments is 28 percent. These alternative investments include hedge funds, reinsurance, private equity limited partnerships, leveraged buyout funds, international venture capital partnerships and real estate. The objective of investing in alternative investments is to provide a higher rate of return than that which is typically available from publicly traded equity securities. Alternative investments are inherently illiquid and require a long-term perspective in evaluating investment performance.\n\n## Investment Strategy for Non-U.S. Pension Plans\n\nThe long-term target allocation for 70 percent of our international subsidiaries' pension plan assets, primarily certain of our European and Canadian plans, was 66 percent equity securities, 4 percent fixed-income securities and 30 percent other investments. The actual allocation for the remaining 30 percent of the Company's international subsidiaries' pension plan assets consisted of 44 percent mutual, pooled and commingled funds; 21 percent fixed-income securities; 1 percent equity securities and 34 percent other investments. The investment strategies for our international subsidiaries' pension plans vary greatly, and in some instances are influenced by local law. None of our pension plans outside the United States is individually significant for separate disclosure.",

      "answer": "The corporate income tax rate in the Philippines was reduced in the first quarter of 2021 as part of the Tax Reform Act, contributing to a decrease in MO's effective tax rate to 21.8% in 2021. However, MO faces significant litigation exposure across multiple jurisdictions, including potential material financial impacts from adverse outcomes in pending cases, which could offset tax savings. Meanwhile, PEP reported low-single-digit growth in the Philippines during 2022, suggesting that while the tax environment was favorable, operational performance in the region was modest, which may influence how both companies assess the net benefit of the tax reform.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MO \u2192 Tax Reform Act: MO's effective tax rate was impacted by foreign tax credit limitations and repatriation costs, partially offset by the corporate income tax rate reduction in the Philippines enacted in Q1 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Note 18. Contingencies\n\nLegal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and its subsidiaries, including PM USA and USSTC, as well as their respective indemnitees and Altria's investees. Various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings, including product liability, unfair trade practices, antitrust, tax, contraband shipments, patent infringement, employment matters, claims alleging violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ('RICO'), claims for contribution and claims of competitors, shareholders or distributors. Legislative action, such as changes to tort law, also may expand the types of claims and remedies available to plaintiffs.\n\nLitigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. Damages claimed in some tobacco-related and other litigation are or can be significant and, in certain cases, have ranged in the billions of dollars. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. In certain cases, plaintiffs claim that defendants' liability is joint and several. In such cases, Altria or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more co-defendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or jury-allocated share of a judgment. As a result, Altria or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding- or judgment-related amounts. Furthermore, in those cases where plaintiffs are successful, Altria or its subsidiaries also may be required to pay interest and attorneys' fees.\n\nAlthough PM USA has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed, there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases. This risk has been substantially reduced given that 47 states and Puerto Rico limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all. As discussed below, however, tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of Florida's bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well. Such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court. States, including Florida, also may seek to repeal or alter bond cap statutes through legislation. Although Altria cannot predict the outcome of such challenges, it is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria, or one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges.\n\nAltria and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except to the extent discussed elsewhere in this Note 18. Contingencies : (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any. Litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nAltria and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation. Nevertheless, litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain. It is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria, or one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Altria and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. Each of the companies has defended, and will continue to defend, vigorously against litigation challenges. However, Altria and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of Altria to do so.",

Coca-Cola HBC represents 17% of Coca-Cola\u2019s worldwide unit case volume and operates under a bottler's agreement that obligates it to purchase concentrates solely from Coca-Cola. In contrast, Philip Morris International (PMI) operates in Hungary and holds at least a 15% market share, distributing its products through a mix of direct sales, independent distributors, and wholesalers. Unlike Coca-Cola\u2019s structured bottler model, PMI tailors its distribution strategy to local market characteristics, using a combination of exclusive zonified distributors and national wholesalers.

The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume.

Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory.

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. In the combustible product category, we predominantly sell American blend cigarette brands, such as Marlboro , L&amp;M , Parliament, Philip Morris and Chesterfield , which are the most popular across many of our markets. In the RRP product category, we predominantly sell Platform 1 devices and heated tobacco units under the IQOS brand  umbrella. We seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories, although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premium-price category.\n\nThe  competitive  environment  and  our  competitive  position  can  be  significantly  influenced  by  weak  economic  conditions,  erosion  of consumer  confidence,  competitors'  introduction  of  lower-price  products  or  innovative  products,  higher  tobacco  product  taxes,  higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products  and  restricts  adult  consumer  access  to  truthful  and  non-misleading  information  about  our  RRPs.  Competitors  in  our  industry include three large international tobacco companies, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and  local  tobacco  companies  and,  in  some  instances,  state-owned  tobacco  enterprises,  principally  in Algeria,  Egypt,  the  PRC,  Taiwan, Thailand  and  Vietnam.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative products  through  inappropriate  marketing  campaigns,  messaging  and  inferior  product  satisfaction,  while  not  relying  on  scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the  dissemination  of  inaccurate  and  misleading  information  about  our  RRPs,  all  of  which  could  have  a  mutual  adverse  effect  on  our profitability and results of operations.\n\n## Procurement and Raw Materials\n\nWe purchase tobacco leaf of various types, grades and styles throughout the world, mostly through independent tobacco suppliers. In 2021, we also contracted directly with farmers in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Pakistan and Poland. In 2021, direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 25% of PMI's global leaf requirements. The largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from Argentina, Brazil, China, Italy, Indonesia (mostly for domestic use in kretek products), Malawi, Mozambique, the Philippines, Turkey and the United States.\n\nWe  believe  that  there  is  an  adequate  supply  of  tobacco  leaf  in  the  world  markets  to  satisfy  our  current  and  anticipated  production requirements.",

KO's bottler's agreement with Arca Continental obligates the company to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups from KO or Company-authorized suppliers, and KO refrains from selling or distributing the designated beverages in Arca Continental's territory in the particular authorized containers, demonstrating a contractual structure that supports Arca Continental's ongoing presence in the region.",

          "chunk_text": "current  and  anticipated  production  requirements.  However,  some  components  and  materials  necessary  for  the  production  of  our  RRPs, including those for the electronic devices, are obtained from single or limited sources, and can be subject to industry-wide shortages and price fluctuations. While we were successful in maintaining adequate supply of such components and materials so far, we may not be able to secure such supply going forward, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; this could negatively impact the commercialization of our RRPs.\n\nIn addition, we are also exposed to a world-wide shortage of semiconductors, which continues to put constraints on our device supplies for RRPs. We believe, however, that the overall impact of this shortage remains manageable, and we have adjusted our device assortments to limit the effect on consumer availability of our RRPs.\n\nWe discuss product warranties in more detail in Item 8, Note 5. Product Warranty . The significance of warranty claims is dependent on a number of factors, including device version mix, product failure rates, logistics and service delivery costs, and warranty policies, and may increase with the number of devices sold.\n\nProduct quality may affect consumer acceptance of our RRPs.\n\nOur near-term planned commercialization efforts for the other PMI-developed RRP platforms are as follows:\n\n- We started commercializing an improved version of our IQOS MESH product in Canada, Corsica, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Ukraine and New Zealand under the IQOS VEEV or VEEV brand names. We currently plan to launch this product in additional markets.\n- With respect to TEEPS , our Platform 2 product, we finalized our improvements to this product and conducted a consumer test in the last quarter of 2021. As a result of the feedback from this consumer test, the design of our current Platform 2 technology has been discontinued. We are assessing alternative designs for this consumer segment.\n- Following the consumer test conducted in 2020, and the results of the product use and adaptation study described above, we are incorporating our learnings into our plans to improve our Platform 3 product.\n- We launched  a  Platform  5  product  in  Sweden  in  January  2022,  that  is  a  reformulated  version  of  the  already  commercialized nicotine pouches bearing the Shiro brand by our newly acquired affiliate AG Snus.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of these commercialization efforts could be delayed.\n\nRRP Regulation and Taxation: RRPs contain nicotine and are not risk-free. As we describe in more detail above, we support science-based regulation and taxation of RRPs, and believe that regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present, are  likely  to  present,  or  have  the  potential  to  present  less  risk  of  harm  to  adult  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continued smoking and should recognize  a  continuum  of  risk  for  tobacco  and  other  nicotine-containing  products.  Regulation,  as  well  as  industry practices, should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form.\n\nSome governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotine-containing products such as our RRPs and communication of truthful and non-misleading information about such products.\n\nThese  regulations  might  foreclose  or  unreasonably  restrict  adult  consumer  access  even  to  products  that  might  be  shown  to  be  a  better consumer  choice  than  continuing  to  smoke.  During  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  some  governments  have  been  and  may  continue  to  be temporarily unable to focus on the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business.\n\nWe oppose blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking. By contrast, we support regulation that sets clear standards for all RRP categories and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke.\n\nIn the United States, an established regulatory framework for assessing 'Modified Risk Tobacco Products' and 'New Tobacco Products' exists  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  FDA.  We  submitted  to  the  FDA  a  Modified  Risk  Tobacco  Product Application  ('MRTPA')  for  our Platform 1 product in December 2016, and a Premarket Tobacco Product Application ('PMTA') for our Platform 1 product in March 2017.",

The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 48 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\n\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola refranchised its bottling operations in the Philippines in February 2024, which is classified as a structural change affecting the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments. This refranchising likely reduced KO\u2019s reported unit case volume in the Bottling Investments segment, although overall Asia Pacific unit case volume growth remained intact due to indirect sales through bottling partners. In contrast, PepsiCo reported mid-single-digit beverage unit volume growth in Thailand during the same period, indicating differing market performance despite similar geographic exposure in the region.",

          "chunk_text": "We generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as 'structural changes,' which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company's unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's acquisitions and divestitures.\n\n'Acquired brands' refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.\n\n'Licensed brands' refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.\n\nIn January 2023, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Vietnam. The impact of this refranchising has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments. In January, February and December 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in certain territories in India, and in February 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Bangladesh and the Philippines. The impact of each of these refranchisings has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments.\n\nIn May 2023, the Company acquired certain brands in Asia Pacific. The impact of acquiring these brands has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Asia Pacific operating segment.\n\n## Beverage Volume\n\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, 'unit case' means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and 'unit case volume' means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.",

We describe certain pending matters in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies .\n\nIn November 2010, a World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") panel issued its decision in a dispute between the Philippines and Thailand, concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\") into Thailand. The decision concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the Thai government and created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports.  Thailand agreed to fully comply with the decision, but the Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision and commenced challenges at the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO Appellate Body is not operational, and the appeals by Thailand are suspended indefinitely. In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues and the countries have since agreed to seek the establishment of a bilateral consultative mechanism, with the goal of reaching a comprehensive settlement of their dispute, consistent with their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreements, as well as the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families in the country. We continue commercial activities in select locations where safety allows, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and supplies the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement. Production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended. On June 20, 2023, we announced the investment of $30 million in a new production facility in the Lviv region, in Western Ukraine. Preparatory work for the facility began in July 2023. The new production facility was completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and local production commenced in April 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our Ukrainian operations had approximately $0.6 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances.\n\nIn Russia, we are continuously assessing the evolving situation in the country. This includes regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. As of December 31, 2024, our Russian operations had approximately $2.7 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $1.0 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles).\n\nAdditionally, we hold a 23% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution B.V ., which was the holding company of JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), pursuant to Dutch law, PMI's distributor in Russia. On July 18, 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Trade filed a petition before the Arbitrazh Court of Moscow seeking the forced localization of JSC TK Megapolis. On December 5, 2024, JSC TK Megapolis registered the transfer of this equity interest to PMI affiliate ZAO Philip Morris Izhora. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. Related Parties - Equity Investments and Other and Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies.\n\nThese developments above have or may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in impairment charges.\n\nFor further details, see Item 1A. Risk Factors , Item 8, Note 4. War in Ukraine and the \"Trade Policy \" section of this Item 7.\n\n## Impact of Inflation on Our Business and Mitigation E fforts\n\nLike many other global companies, we have experienced inflationary pressures in 2022, 2023 and 2024, including: growing pressures on the cost of certain direct materials, wages, energy, transportation, and logistics as well as an increased cost of capital due to interest rate increases driven by the response to increased inflation. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact on cost of sales was approximately $580 million. In 2024, the impact on cost of sales was approximately 30% of the 2023 level, benefiting from lower prices for direct materials and utilities, despite continued pressure on tobacco leaf costs. In 2025, we expect certain inflationary elements such as direct materials and utilities to stabilize, with a moderate overall increase in inflationary pressures driven by tobacco leaf costs.\n\nInflationary impacts driven by higher wages have resulted from merit increases that reflect local inflation as we continuously evaluate our compensation and benefit offerings to be competitive with the current market. Increased transportation costs resulted from increased shipping rates for all modes of transportation (air, ocean and inland) due to ocean and air capacity constraints. Increases in",

      "question": "How might the implementation of the OECD's global minimum tax framework impact the effective tax rates of both PepsiCo and Altria, given their differing U.S. tax burdens and exposure to international tax changes?",
      "answer": "The implementation of the OECD's global minimum tax framework could increase PepsiCo's effective tax rate due to its international operations and exposure to countries implementing the 15% minimum tax, as noted in PepsiCo's 10-K. Altria, which reported $2,346 million in federal tax payments in the U.S. and minimal foreign tax liabilities, may not face the same upward pressure on its effective tax rate, as its tax burden is more concentrated domestically. The U.S. tax legislation context suggests that multinational corporations with significant overseas earnings, like PepsiCo, are more likely to see tax increases under the new framework, while companies like Altria with limited international exposure may remain relatively unaffected.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PEP \u2192 Tax Legislation: PepsiCo explicitly notes that the OECD's global minimum tax could increase its tax liabilities as countries implement the framework starting in 2024.",
        "Hop 2: Tax Legislation \u2192 US: The BLK document highlights that U.S. tax legislation is evolving in response to the OECD framework, particularly around multinational corporate taxation.",
        "Hop 3: US \u2190 MO: Altria's 2023 tax filings show $2,346 million in federal taxes paid in the U.S. and only $1 million in foreign taxes, indicating minimal international tax exposure compared to PepsiCo."

Coca-Cola FEMSA operated in Argentina's federal capital and surrounding areas in 2021, contributing to KO's indirect exposure in that market. Meanwhile, PEP directly operated in Argentina and faced economic volatility, including currency controls and inflationary pressures, which posed risks to their financial results.

Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 42 percent of U.S. unit case volume. Unit case volume outside the United States represented 83 percent of the Company's worldwide unit case volume in 2021. The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 48 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\n\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

See 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' for further discussion.\n\n## Commodity Prices\n\nOur  commodity  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $1.6  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $1.1 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  At  the  end  of  2021,  the  potential  change  in  fair  value  of  commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $177 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nOur operations outside of the United States generated 44% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa, collectively, comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks  in  the  international  markets  in  which  our  products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2021,  favorable  foreign  exchange  contributed  1  percentage  point  to  net  revenue  growth,  primarily  due  to appreciation  in  the  Mexican  peso,  Canadian  dollar  and  South African  rand.  Currency  declines  against  the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.\n\nIn addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold,  including  in Argentina,  Brazil,  China,  Mexico,  the Middle  East,  Russia  and  Turkey,  and  currency  controls  or  fluctuations  in  certain  of  these  international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments.\n\nOur foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $1.9 billion  as  of  December 26, 2020. At the end of 2021, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $278 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.\n\nThe total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nOur interest  rate  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $2.1  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $3.0 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  Assuming  year-end  2021  investment  levels  and  variable  rate  debt,  a  1percentage-point  increase  in  interest  rates  would  have  decreased  our  net  interest  expense  in  2021  by  $47 million  due  to  higher  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  levels,  as  compared  with  our variable rate debt.\n\n## OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\n## Results of Operations - Consolidated Review\n\n## Volume\n\nPhysical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions,  including  the  preparation  of  our  annual  operating  plan  and  the  evaluation  of  our  business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level.",

      "answer": "Walmart has $15.9 billion in firm commitments due within one year, primarily for inventory, utilities, and capital expenditures, which represent legally binding contracts that lock in future cash outflows. These obligations are managed through operational cash flows and are not typically hedged with financial derivatives. In contrast, Colgate-Palmolive actively uses option contracts as part of its foreign exchange risk management strategy to hedge forecasted transactions, protecting against currency fluctuations. Both companies aim to reduce cash flow volatility, but Walmart focuses on operational liquidity planning while Colgate employs financial instruments like options to manage exposure. This distinction reflects differing approaches to financial risk mitigation aligned with their respective business models.",

Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations. See Note 6 and Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, respectively.\n\nAs of January 31, 2025, the Company has $37.2 billion of unrecorded purchase obligations outstanding, of which $15.9 billion is due within one year. Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fix ed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fix ed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fix ed or minimum quantity, are ex cluded from the obligations quantified above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are also ex cluded as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.\n\n## Capital Resources\n\nWe believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million. The following table summarizes the effect of foreign ex change cash flow hedges on AOCI:\n\n",

Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material, as it is the Company's policy to contract only with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, sourcing strategies, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company's treasury and risk management policies, which prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose. It is the Company's policy to enter into derivative instrument contracts with terms that match the underlying exposure being hedged. Provided below are details of the Company's exposures by type of risk and derivative instruments by type of hedge designation.\n\n## Valuation Considerations\n\nThe Company's derivative instruments include foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts. The fair value of these instruments are classified as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements.\n\nThe Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates (Level 2 valuation).\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company utilizes forward-starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rates for future debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates (Level 2 valuation).",

Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 42 percent of U.S. unit case volume. Unit case volume outside the United States represented 83 percent of the Company's worldwide unit case volume in 2021. The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 48 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\n\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

      "answer": "Target's Five-Year Credit Agreement, dated October 18, 2021, lists Bank of America, N.A. as the Administrative Agent and includes JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as one of the participating banks. In contrast, Mondelez's February 23, 2022 Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement specifically names JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as the Administrative Agent. Both agreements involve JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but in different roles, reflecting distinct administrative structures and lender hierarchies.",

      "answer": "In 2021, Colgate-Palmolive's Asia Pacific segment, which includes Taiwan, experienced 3.0% organic sales growth, primarily driven by Oral Care products like toothpaste and manual toothbrushes. While Procter & Gamble's Greater China segment, which also includes Taiwan, contributed to the company's overall organic sales growth, the specific organic growth rate for Taiwan within Greater China was not disclosed. Therefore, while Colgate-Palmolive's performance in Taiwan can be quantified at 3.0% organic growth, P&G\u2019s specific contribution from Taiwan remains unspecified.",

          "chunk_text": "and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  our  Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&amp;A is organized in the following sections:\n\n- Overview\n- Summary of 2022 Results\n- Economic Conditions and Uncertainties\n- Results of Operations\n- Segment Results\n- Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity\n- Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates\n- Other Information\n\nThroughout the MD&amp;A  we  refer  to measures used  by management to evaluate  performance,  including  unit  volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per share and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures  that  are  not  defined  under  accounting  principles generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core earnings per share  (Core  EPS),  adjusted  free  cash  flow  and  adjusted  free cash  flow  productivity.  Organic  sales  growth  is  net  sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is  diluted  net  earnings  per  share  from  continuing  operations excluding  certain  items  that  are  not  judged  to  be  part  of  the Company's  sustainable  results  or  trends.  Adjusted  free  cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and transitional tax payments related to the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio  of  adjusted  free  cash  flow  to  net  earnings  excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors  with  additional  information  about  our  underlying results  and  trends  as  well  as  insight  to  some  of  the  metrics used  to  evaluate  management. The  explanation  at  the  end  of the MD&amp;A provides more details on the use and the derivation of  these  measures  as  well  as  reconciliations  to  the  most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\n\nManagement  also  uses certain market share  and  market consumption  estimates  to  evaluate  performance  relative  to competition  despite  some  limitations  on  the  availability  and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&amp;A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brickand-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category.  The Company  measures  quarter  and  fiscal  year-to-date  market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two  months  as  compared  to  the  end  of  the  reporting  period. Management  also  uses  unit  volume  growth  to  evaluate  and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects  year-over-year  changes  in  unit  volume  excluding  the impacts  of acquisitions, divestitures  and  certain  one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nProcter  &amp;  Gamble  is  a  global  leader  in  the  fast-moving  consumer  goods  industry,  focused  on  providing  branded  consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport dutyfree  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies,  electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell  direct  to  individual consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.\n\nOur market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments  in  which  we  sell  our  products,  we  compete  against  other  branded  products,  as  well  as  retailers'  private-label  brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.\n\n## Organizational Structure\n\nOur organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).\n\n## Sector Business Units\n\nThe Company's ten product categories are organized into five SBUs and five reportable segments (under U.S. GAAP): Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric &amp; Home Care; and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. The SBUs are responsible for global brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovation, marketing plans and supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings (referred to as Focus Markets) and are also responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). Throughout the MD&amp;A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).",

Further information regarding the Company's reportable segments can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, 'Segment Information and Geographic Data.'\n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in millions):\n\n",

Organic sales in Asia Pacific increased 3.0% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by India and the Greater China region.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was primarily due to an increase in Oral Care organic sales.

This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due primarily to an increase in Gross profit (50 bps) and a decrease in Other (income) expense, net (40 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was primarily due to cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (230 bps), mix (20 bps) and other, partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs (230 bps).

      "answer": "Vietnam's tobacco market volume increased by 10.0%, primarily due to reduced illicit trade caused by pandemic-related supply disruptions. This contributed to the overall growth in South & Southeast Asia's total market, which rose by 7.2% to 722.6 billion units. PM saw a decrease in shipment volume by 1.8% to 142.2 billion units, mainly due to declines in the Philippines and Thailand, despite the growth in Vietnam.

          "chunk_text": "## COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19 have had and continue to have a profound impact on the way people live, work, interact and shop and have significantly impacted and continue to impact economic activity around the world. We have a well-established Crisis Management Team ('CMT') process, and the CMT, together with our senior management team and Colgate people around the world, continue to respond to and manage the challenges presented by COVID-19.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the communities in which we manufacture, market and sell our products experienced and in some cases continue to experience 'stay at home' orders, travel or movement restrictions and other government actions to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19, and have implemented varying policies to address the pandemic, resume economic activity and vaccinate their populations. The situation continues to be uncertain and varies by geography, as the impact of COVID-19 remains significant in many countries throughout the world, including Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Thailand, the U.S. and Vietnam, where we have substantial manufacturing facilities. Because the vast majority of our products (such as oral care products, soaps and other personal hygiene products, home cleaners and pet food) have been deemed essential for the health and well-being of people and their pets, we have, in most instances, been able to continue operating our business, although not always at full capacity.\n\nThe health, safety and well-being of our employees and their families has been and remains our first priority. While we have reopened most of our offices, in some instances on a limited and voluntary basis, many of our office-based employees globally continue to work from home. We have implemented additional health and safety measures consistent with government recommendations and/or requirements to help ensure employee safety in our offices, production facilities, warehouses and technology centers, often at additional cost. These measures may include: health and temperature screening, social distancing and personal protective equipment protocols, hand washing, contact tracing, enhanced cleaning procedures, respiratory hygiene, education and, in some instances, testing and/or vaccination requirements. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen increased instances of absenteeism and, in some cases, we have experienced some limited production facility closures and related supply chain disruptions. Furthermore, some of our suppliers, customers, distributors, logistics providers and service providers have experienced disruptions to their businesses.\n\nWe saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories, such as liquid hand soap, dish liquid, bar soap and cleaners, during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by consumer pantry-loading and increased consumption of our products. While consumer demand for most of these categories declined year-over-year in 2021, most still remained above historical levels, and we believe that some of this increase in consumption is sustainable in light of changes in consumer behavior related to COVID-19. Across our business, changes in consumer demand for our products vary by product category, channel and geography depending on, among other things, the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, the availability of our products at retailers and supply chain disruptions. At the same time, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced disruptions in certain channels, including travel retail. We also continue to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers, including the nature and/or frequency of visits by consumers to retailers and dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online.\n\nCOVID-19 and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19 have impacted and may continue to impact our consumers' ability to purchase and our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. While we believe that, in the long-term, consumer demand for the products in our categories will continue to be strong, uncertainties continue surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. These uncertainties include: the impact of the timing and scale of changes to travel and movement restrictions in certain geographies, the availability and widespread distribution and use of COVID-19 vaccines, the emergence and spread of COVID-19 variants, the timing and impact of consumer pantry-loading and destocking activity in certain markets, product demand trends and the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy, including as a result of inflation, and supply chain disruptions. COVID-19 has also disrupted our retail customers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers and other third parties; their ability to address COVID-19 and maintain their operations at full capacity has impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products. We expect the ongoing economic impact and health concerns associated with COVID-19 to continue to impact consumer behavior, shopping patterns and consumption preferences during 2022.\n\nWhile we currently expect to be able to continue operating our business as described above and we intend to continue to work with government authorities and to follow the necessary protocols to maintain the health and safety of our employees and third parties, uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 could result in an unforeseen additional disruption to our business, including our global supply chain and retailer network, and/or require us to incur additional operational costs.\n\nFor more information about the anticipated COVID-19 impact, see 'Outlook' below.",

Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our tobacco operating companies' and investees' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes; imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact Altria's consolidated results of operations and cash flows, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL, and the businesses of its tobacco operating companies and investees; or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies communicate with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities, enforce wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products and, when necessary, litigate to protect their trademarks.\n\n## Price, Availability and Quality of Tobacco, Other Raw Materials, Ingredients and Component Parts\n\nShifts in crops (such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns), government restrictions and mandated prices, production control programs, economic trade sanctions, import duties and tariffs, international trade disruptions, inflation, geopolitical instability, climate and environmental changes and disruptions due to man-made or natural disasters may increase the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco or other raw materials or ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our companies' and our investees' products. Any significant change in the price, availability or quality of tobacco, other raw materials, ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our products and those of our investees could restrict our tobacco operating companies' and investees' ability to continue manufacturing and marketing existing products or impact adult consumer product acceptability and adversely affect our tobacco operating companies' and investees' profitability and businesses.\n\nWith respect to tobacco, as with other agricultural commodities, crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. Additionally, the price and availability of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand. Economic conditions, including inflation and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, are unpredictable, which, among other factors, may result in changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production which could negatively impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply. In addition, as consumer demand increases for smoke-free products and decreases for combustible products, the volume of tobacco leaf required for production may decrease. The reduced demand for tobacco leaf may result in the reduced supply and availability of domestic tobacco as growers divert resources to other crops, which could result in increased costs to our tobacco operating companies.\n\nTobacco production in certain countries also is subject to a variety of controls, including government-mandated prices and production control programs.  Moreover, certain types of tobacco are only available in limited geographies, including geographies experiencing political instability or government prohibitions on the import or export of tobacco, and loss of their availability could impair our subsidiaries' ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also may limit access to and increase the cost of raw materials, component parts and personal protective equipment as United States and global suppliers may temporarily shut down facilities or use different production schedules with lower productivity in order to address exposure to the virus or as a result of a government mandate. In addition, (i) current labor market dynamics indicate labor shortages, with employers in a number of industries having difficulty employing workers and (ii) supply chain dynamics reflect failures and delays resulting from various issues including labor shortages, logistical problems and weather-related incidents. These labor shortages and supply failures and delays have led to certain increases in raw material (for example, resins used in our packaging), ingredient and component part prices and may lead to supply chain disruptions; however, to date, the impact on our operating companies and investees has been immaterial. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, labor market dynamics and supply chain disruptions outlined above may continue, which could adversely affect our subsidiaries' and investees' profitability and businesses. Recent economic conditions reflect an increased rate of inflation. To date, higher inflation has not had a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability. Although Altria anticipates inflation will continue at elevated levels in 2022, it is not expected to have a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability.\n\nIn addition, government taxes, restrictions and prohibitions on the sale and use of certain products may limit access to, and increase the costs of, raw materials and component parts and, potentially, impede our ability to sell certain of our products.

Reportable segments are largely based on management's organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Effective for fiscal 2022, stock-based compensation was allocated to the segments in this reporting. This change reflected a decision to evaluate the financial performance of the segments inclusive of this expense. Operating income was restated in each of the segments for all prior periods to reflect this change.\n\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\n\n",

The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks.

('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

Similarly, DIS's VAR model also explicitly excludes forecasted transactions and firm commitments from its computation, despite using a variance/co-variance technique that considers interrelationships between interest rates, currencies, and commodities. PM, on the other hand, actively hedges forecasted transactions using foreign exchange and commodity contracts, specifically referencing exposure to currencies like the Euro, Japanese yen, and Mexican peso, as well as raw material price risks. This contrast highlights that while both MDLZ and DIS omit forecasted transactions in their VAR models, PM directly incorporates them into its risk mitigation strategy through derivative contracts.",

      "answer": "The Tax Reform Act's GILTI provisions impacted Coca-Cola's 2022 effective tax rate by requiring the company to account for these taxes in the period subject to such tax, contributing to a $431 million net tax expense (4.4% impact on effective tax rate). For Philip Morris International, the corporate income tax rate reduction enacted in the Philippines in Q1 2021 contributed to a 0.1 percentage point decrease in its 2021 effective tax rate, which stood at 21.8%.

Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any additional outside basis differences in these entities is not practicable.\n\nThe Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ('GILTI') provisions of the Tax Reform Act require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return each foreign subsidiary's earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary's tangible assets. An accounting policy election is available to either account for the tax effects of GILTI in the period that is subject to such taxes or to provide deferred taxes for book and tax basis differences that upon reversal may be subject to such taxes. We have elected to account for the tax effects of these provisions in the period that is subject to such tax and the impact is reflected in our full year provision.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in all applicable jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal jurisdiction, U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions. U.S. tax authorities have completed their federal income tax examinations for all years prior to 2007. With respect to U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions, with limited exceptions, the Company and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to 2006. For U.S. federal and state tax purposes, the net operating losses and tax credit carryovers acquired in connection with our acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.'s former North America business that were generated from the years of 1990 through 2010 are subject to adjustments until the year in which they are actually utilized is no longer subject to examination. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company believes that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been provided for in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance.",

The company also states it attempts to 'carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Turkey.' This directly ties to PM's evidence that Turkey's cigarette market grew by 8.2%, primarily reflecting 'the impact on adult smoker average daily consumption of the easing of pandemic-related measures, coupled with increased in-bound tourism (particularly by Turkish expatriates).'

Net  sales  could  also  be  adversely  impacted  following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on the consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including     supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. If we  are not successful in  executing  and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our  gross  margin,  operating  margin,  net  earnings  and  cash flows.\n\nForeign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure  to  the  fluctuation  of  exchange  rates.  Translation exposures relate to exchange  rate impacts of  measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a  currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation  of  transaction-related  working  capital  balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In  the  past  three  years,  a  number  of  foreign  currencies  have weakened  versus  the  U.S.  dollar,  leading  to  lower  sales  and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries  that  recently  had  and  are  currently  experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Russia. These fluctuations have significantly  impacted  our  historical  net  sales,  costs  and  net earnings  and  could  do  so  in  the  future.  Increased  pricing  in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  may  offset  portions  of  the  currency  impacts  but  could also  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  consumption  of  our products,  which  would  negatively  affect  our  net  sales,  gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nGovernment Policies. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative,  regulatory  or  enforcement  policies.  For  example, our  net  earnings  and  cash  flows  could  be  affected  by  any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under  the  current  work  being  led  by  the  OECD  for  the  G20 focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the  Economy.\"  The  breadth  of  the  OECD  project  extends beyond pure digital businesses, and if agreed and enacted by most  countries,  is  likely  to  impact  most  large  multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and broadly  establishing  a  15%  minimum  tax  on  their  foreign operations. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and  climate change  matters.  Additionally, we  attempt  to carefully  manage  our  debt,  currency  and  other  exposures  in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and  pricing  controls,  such  as  Nigeria,  Turkey, Argentina  and Egypt. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere.  Changes  in  government  policies  in  these  areas might  cause  an  increase  or  decrease  in  our  net  sales,  gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nCOVID-19  Pandemic. Because  we  sell  products  that  are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nHowever, the continued evolution of the pandemic may result in economic recessions or a slowdown of economic growth in certain countries or regions. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products (due to governmental actions or  key  material,  transportation  and  labor  shortages  impacting our  ability  to  produce  and  ship  products)  or  could  impact consumers'  movements  and  access  to  our  products.  There could also be reduced demand due to consumption decreases and consumer pantry destocking (particularly, in home cleaning,  health  and  hygiene  products)  as  economic  activity resumes  following  slowdowns  or  relaxation  of  governmental restrictions.  Net,  the  uncertainty  in  the  timing  and  extent  of demand  volatility,  the  relaxation  and  reimplementation  of movement  restrictions,  the  timing  and  impact  of  potential consumer pantry destocking, the future economic trends due to a  resurgence  of  positive  cases  and  governmental  actions  in response  to  the  pandemic  may  result  in  heightened  volatility and negative impacts to net sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the pandemic.\n\nWhile we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets due primarily to the restriction of employee movements, key material and labor shortages and transportation constraints. We intend to continue to work with our suppliers and government authorities to implement employee  safety  measures  to  minimize  disruption  to  the manufacturing and distribution of our products. The continued evolution of the pandemic and uncertainty with regards to the disruptions  caused  either  by  resurgence  of  positive  cases  or governmental actions in response to the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain and impact our operations (for example, the closure of a key manufacturing or distribution  facility  or  the  inability  of  a  key  material  or transportation supplier to source and transport materials).\n\nThe pandemic has not had a material negative impact on the Company's liquidity position. We continue to generate operating  cash  flows  to  meet  our  short-term  liquidity  needs and continue to maintain access to capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings.\n\nRussia-Ukraine  War .  The  war  between  Russia  and  Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both countries. Our Ukraine  business  includes  two  manufacturing  sites.  We  have approximately  500  employees  including  both  manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. Our operations in Ukraine accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in fiscal 2022. Additionally, net assets of our Ukraine subsidiary, along",

      "answer": "MDLZ uses weighted-average assumptions to determine its net periodic postretirement healthcare costs, which resulted in costs of $14 million in 2021, $12 million in 2022, and a benefit of $5 million in 2023. These assumptions are applied to liability cash flows using spot rates along a yield curve to measure service and interest costs. In contrast, KO uses weighted-average assumptions as inputs in the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which are then expensed on a straight-line basis over a four-year vesting period.

Background and Basis of Presentation\n\nWhen used in these notes, the term 'Altria' refers to Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.\n\n- Background: At December 31, 2021, Altria's wholly owned subsidiaries included Philip Morris USA Inc. ('PM USA'), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the United States; John Middleton Co. ('Middleton'), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco and is a wholly owned subsidiary of PM USA; UST LLC ('UST'), which through its wholly owned subsidiary U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC ('USSTC'), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of moist smokeless tobacco products ('MST') and snus products; Helix Innovations LLC ('Helix'), which operates in the United States and Canada, and Helix Innovations GmbH and its subsidiaries ('Helix ROW'), which operate internationally in the rest-of-world, are engaged in the manufacture and sale of on! oral nicotine pouches; and Philip Morris Capital Corporation ('PMCC'), which maintains a portfolio of finance assets, substantially all of which are leveraged leases. Other Altria wholly owned subsidiaries included Altria Group Distribution Company, which provides sales and distribution services to certain Altria operating subsidiaries, and Altria Client Services LLC, which provides various support services in areas such as legal, regulatory, consumer engagement, finance, human resources and external affairs to Altria. Altria's access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2021, Altria's significant wholly owned subsidiaries were not limited by contractual obligations in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.\n\nIn October 2021, UST sold its subsidiary, International Wine &amp; Spirits Ltd. ('IWS'), which included Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd. ('Ste. Michelle'), to an entity controlled by investment funds managed by Sycamore Partners Management, L.P. in an all-cash transaction with a net purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion and the assumption of certain liabilities of IWS and its subsidiaries (the 'Ste. Michelle Transaction').\n\nIn 2019, Helix acquired Burger S\u00f6hne Holding and its subsidiaries as well as certain affiliated companies that are engaged in the manufacture and sale of on! oral nicotine pouches. At closing, Altria owned an 80% interest in Helix, for which Altria paid $353 million. At December 31, 2021, Altria owned 100% of the global on! business as a result of transactions in December 2020 and April 2021 to purchase the remaining 20% interest in (i) Helix ROW and (ii) Helix, respectively. The total purchase price of the December 2020 and April 2021 transactions was approximately $250 million.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Altria's investments in equity securities consisted of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV ('ABI'), Cronos Group Inc. ('Cronos') and JUUL Labs, Inc. ('JUUL'). Altria accounts for its investments in ABI and Cronos under the equity method of accounting using a one-quarter lag. Altria accounts for its equity investment in JUUL under the fair value option.\n\nFor further discussion of Altria's investments in equity securities, see Note 6. Investments in Equity Securities .\n\n- Basis of Presentation: The consolidated financial statements include Altria, as well as its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in equity securities in which Altria has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or the fair value option. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('GAAP') requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions include, among other things, pension and benefit plan assumptions, lives and valuation assumptions for goodwill and other intangible assets, impairment and fair value evaluations for equity investments, marketing programs and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nCertain immaterial prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation.\n\nOn January 1, 2021, Altria adopted Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes ('ASU No. 2019-12'). This guidance removes certain exceptions for investments, intraperiod allocations and interim calculations, and adds guidance to reduce complexity in accounting for income taxes. The adoption of ASU No. 2019-12 did not have a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements.\n\nAdditionally, on January 1, 2021, Altria adopted ASU No. 2020-01, Investments - Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815 ('ASU No. 2020-01'). This guidance provides clarification of the interaction of rules for equity securities, the equity method of accounting, and forward contracts and purchase options on certain types of securities. The adoption of ASU No. 2020-01 did not have a material impact on Altria's consolidated financial statements.",

In contrast, multiemployer pension plans referenced in the evidence include vesting periods that determine eligibility for retirement benefits, though specific durations are not disclosed. Mondel\u0113z contributed $4 million in 2021, $5 million in 2020, and $5 million in 2019 to these plans, but also faced a significant $526 million withdrawal liability tied to a multiemployer pension fund after exiting one plan in 2018, with payments stretched over 19 years.

          "chunk_text": "\nThe Walmart Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the \"Plan\"), as subsequently amended and restated, was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, restricted stock units, performance share units and other equity compensation awards for which 260 million shares of Walmart common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders.\n\nThe Plan's award types are summarized as follows:\n\n- Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period. Beginning in fiscal 2020, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 25% each year over a four year period from the date of the grant. Prior to fiscal 2020, 50% of restricted stock units generally vested three years from the grant date and the remaining 50% were vested five years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period. The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 3.8%, 4.4% and 4.9%, respectively.\n- Restricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment. Performance-based restricted stock units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and generally range from 0% to 150% of the original award amount. Vesting periods for these awards are generally between one and three years. Restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 4.2%, 4.5% and 5.1%, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the Plan, Flipkart has certain share-based compensation plans for associates under which options to acquire Flipkart common shares may be issued. Share-based compensation expense associated with these plans is included in the Other line in the table above.",

The  variability  in  pleadings  in  multiple  jurisdictions,  together  with  the  actual  experience  of  management  in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome.

In contrast, PEP's operations in the Philippines experienced low-single-digit growth, and the corporate income tax rate reduction enacted in the Philippines in Q1 2021 contributed to a favorable impact on PEP's effective tax rate, lowering it by an unspecified but notable amount.

Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any additional outside basis differences in these entities is not practicable.\n\nThe Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ('GILTI') provisions of the Tax Reform Act require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return each foreign subsidiary's earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary's tangible assets. An accounting policy election is available to either account for the tax effects of GILTI in the period that is subject to such taxes or to provide deferred taxes for book and tax basis differences that upon reversal may be subject to such taxes. We have elected to account for the tax effects of these provisions in the period that is subject to such tax and the impact is reflected in our full year provision.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in all applicable jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal jurisdiction, U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions. U.S. tax authorities have completed their federal income tax examinations for all years prior to 2007. With respect to U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions, with limited exceptions, the Company and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to 2006. For U.S. federal and state tax purposes, the net operating losses and tax credit carryovers acquired in connection with our acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.'s former North America business that were generated from the years of 1990 through 2010 are subject to adjustments until the year in which they are actually utilized is no longer subject to examination. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company believes that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been provided for in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance.",

Given that PM USA itself faces contingent liabilities from Canadian class-action lawsuits (e.g., $34 million allocated to RBH in the L\u00e9tourneau case and involvement in other pending suits), its ability to fulfill guarantee obligations to MO could be impacted if litigation outcomes require significant payouts.

Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business.

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

These contracts are valued using observable market rates (Level 2 valuation). Option contracts are used to offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of forecasted foreign currency transactions, assets, and liabilities, and their gains or losses are deferred in AOCI until the hedged transactions occur. PepsiCo, on the other hand, discloses that it is exposed to foreign exchange risk from foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business, particularly in international markets such as Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the UK, South Africa, and Brazil, which collectively accounted for approximately 25% of its consolidated net revenue in 2024. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced PepsiCo\u2019s net revenue performance by 1.5 percentage points in 2024, highlighting the material impact of foreign currency exposure. Both companies rely on option contracts to manage this exposure, but Colgate explicitly ties the contracts to Level 2 valuation and 12-month duration limits, while PepsiCo emphasizes the geographic concentration and resulting performance impact.",

Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material, as it is the Company's policy to contract only with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, sourcing strategies, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company's treasury and risk management policies, which prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose. It is the Company's policy to enter into derivative instrument contracts with terms that match the underlying exposure being hedged. Provided below are details of the Company's exposures by type of risk and derivative instruments by type of hedge designation.\n\n## Valuation Considerations\n\nThe Company's derivative instruments include foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts. The fair value of these instruments are classified as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements.\n\nThe Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates (Level 2 valuation).\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company utilizes forward-starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rates for future debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates (Level 2 valuation).",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

Gains  and  losses  associated  with  qualifying  cash  flow  hedge  contracts  are  deferred  as  components  of  accumulated  other comprehensive  losses  until  the  underlying  hedged  transactions  are  reported  in  PMI's  consolidated  statements  of  earnings.  As  of December 31, 2021, PMI has hedged forecasted transactions for periods not exceeding the next twelve months, with the exception of one derivative  contract  that  expires  in  May  2024.  The  impact  of  these  hedges  is  primarily  included  in  operating  cash  flows  on  PMI's consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Fair Value Hedges\n\nPMI has entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts, designated as fair value hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate U.S. dollar-denominated debt that results from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. For derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized in current earnings. The carrying amount of the debt hedged, which includes the cumulative adjustment for fair value gains/losses, as of December 31, 2021 was $398 million, and is recorded in long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations\n\nPMI designates derivative contracts and certain foreign currency denominated debt instruments as net investment hedges, primarily of its Euro net assets. The amount of pre-tax gain/(loss) related to these debt instruments, that was reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive  losses  within  currency  translation  adjustment,  was  $278  million,  $(465)  million  and  $234  million,  for  the  years  ended December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  The  premiums  paid  for,  and  settlements  of,  net  investment  hedges  are  included  in investing cash flows on PMI's consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Other Derivatives\n\nPMI has entered  into  derivative  contracts  to  hedge  the  foreign  currency  exchange  and  interest  rate  risks  related  to  intercompany  loans between certain subsidiaries, and third-party loans. While effective as economic hedges, no hedge accounting is applied for these contracts; therefore, the gains (losses) relating to these contracts are reported in PMI's consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Qualifying Hedging Activities Reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses\n\nDerivative gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive losses are a result of qualifying hedging activity. Transfers of these gains  or  losses  to  earnings  are  offset  by  the  corresponding  gains  or  losses  on  the  underlying  hedged  item.  Hedging  activity  affected accumulated other comprehensive losses, net of income taxes, as follows:\n\n",

The total notional value of derivatives related to our economic hedges of this type was $200 million as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe Company also uses certain derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process and vehicle fuel. The changes in the fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized in earnings in the line items net operating revenues, cost of goods sold, or selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income, as applicable.

The fair value of these instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges.\n\nLevel 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of over-the-counter ('OTC') currency exchange forwards, options and swaps; commodity forwards and options; net investment hedge contracts; and interest rate swaps. Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our bifurcated exchange options are valued, as derivative instrument liabilities, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related to the market price of the underlying note and associated credit spread combined with the share of price, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility of the JDE Peet's shares over the life of the option. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our derivative contracts do not have a legal right of set-off. We manage the credit risk in connection with these and all our derivatives by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.",

There were no transfers between levels during 2022 or 2021.\n\n## Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\n\nAssets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets  measured  at  amortized  cost  and  long-lived  nonfinancial  assets.  These  assets  are  measured  at  fair  value  if determined to be impaired. There were no fair value adjustments to nonfinancial assets during 2022 and in 2021 they were immaterial.\n\n## Note 4-Debt\n\n## Short-Term Borrowings\n\nThe Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,257 and $1,050 , in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Borrowings on these short-term facilities were immaterial during 2022 and 2021. Shortterm borrowings outstanding were $88 and $41 at the end of 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Long-Term Debt\n\nThe  Company's  long-term  debt  consists  primarily  of  Senior  Notes,  described  below.  On  December  1,  2021,  the Company repaid, prior to maturity, the 2.300% Senior Notes at a redemption price plus accrued interest as specified in the Notes' agreement.\n\nThe Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain events, the holder has the right to require the Company to purchase this security at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued  and  unpaid  interest  to  the  date  of  the  event.  Interest  on  all  outstanding  long-term  debt  is  payable  semiannually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\n\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs.",

      "question": "How does the 2006 Order's restriction on transferring cigarette brands affect PMI's ability to commercialize Platform 1 in the U.S. following its agreement with Altria, and what role does PM USA's guarantee of Altria's debt play in the potential enforcement of the Order?",
      "answer": "The 2006 Order restricts Altria and PM USA from transferring cigarette brands or business without the transferee submitting to the jurisdiction of the court and subjecting itself to the Order. The U.S. government has informed Altria that PMI must submit to the 2006 Order before the April 30, 2024 transaction to transfer Platform 1 commercialization rights can be effectuated. PM USA, as a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria, guarantees Altria's obligations under its debt securities, which demonstrates the deep legal and financial entanglement between Altria and PM USA. This guarantee could be used by the U.S. government as leverage to ensure compliance with the 2006 Order, as any enforcement action could impact PM USA\u2019s financial standing and, by extension, Altria\u2019s ability to service its $1.0 billion in recently issued senior unsecured notes. Therefore, the enforcement risk under the 2006 Order and PM USA\u2019s financial guarantees to Altria create a complex legal and financial barrier to PMI\u2019s full commercialization of Platform 1 in the U.S.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PM (2023) \u2192 2006 Order: PMI is not a party to the 2006 Order, but the U.S. government believes the Altria-PMI Platform 1 agreement falls under the Order\u2019s restrictions on transferring cigarette brands or business, requiring PMI to submit to the Order before the transaction can proceed.",
        "Hop 2: 2006 Order \u2192 PM USA: PM USA is a party to the 2006 Order and is legally bound by its restrictions on transferring cigarette brands or business. The Order requires any transferee to submit to the court\u2019s jurisdiction, which the U.S. government is now applying to PMI in the context of Platform 1.",
        "Hop 3: PM USA \u2190 MO (Altria): PM USA is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria and guarantees Altria\u2019s debt obligations, including the $1.0 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in November 2023. This financial linkage could be used to pressure compliance with the 2006 Order, as legal enforcement against PM USA could impact Altria\u2019s financial health."

These appeal bonds are part of PM USA's litigation-related obligations to secure stays of judgments pending appeal.

For additional information, see Note 13. Benefit Plans for disclosures related to PMI's pension and other benefits, Note 15.

Our indemnitees include distributors, licensees, and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend, as well as to pay costs and some or all of judgments, if any, that may be entered against them. Pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. (\"Altria\") and PMI, PMI will indemnify Altria and Philip Morris USA Inc. (\"PM USA\"), a  U.S.  tobacco  subsidiary  of Altria,  for  tobacco  product  claims  based  in  substantial  part  on  products  manufactured  by  PMI  or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI.\n\nIt  is  possible  that  there  could  be  adverse  developments  in  pending  cases  against  us  and  our  subsidiaries.  An  unfavorable  outcome  or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.\n\nDamages claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in Brazil, Canada and Nigeria, range into the billions  of  U.S.  dollars.  The  variability  in  pleadings  in  multiple  jurisdictions,  together  with  the  actual  experience  of  management  in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. Much of the tobacco-related litigation is in its early stages, and litigation is subject to uncertainty. However, as discussed below, we have to date been largely successful in defending tobacco-related litigation.",

Pre-tax charges for related interest costs were included in interest and other debt expense, net on Altria's consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\nAfter exhausting all appeals in those cases resulting in adverse verdicts associated with tobacco-related litigation, since October 2004, PM USA has paid judgments and settlements (including related costs and fees) totaling approximately $896 million and interest totaling approximately $227 million as of December 31, 2021. These amounts include payments for Engle progeny judgments (and related costs and fees) totaling approximately $410 million and related interest totaling approximately $56 million.\n\nSecurity for Judgments: To obtain stays of judgments pending appeal, PM USA has posted various forms of security.

Michelle Transaction, which was used to partially fund the expansion of the January 2021 share repurchase program as discussed in Note 10. Capital Stock to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 10').\n\nIn October 2020, Altria filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, under which Altria may offer debt securities or warrants to purchase debt securities from time to time over a three-year period from the date of filing.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Future Contractual Obligations\n\nAltria has no off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, other than guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below.\n\nGuarantees and Other Similar Matters - As discussed in Note 18, Altria and certain of its subsidiaries had unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2021. From time to time, subsidiaries of Altria also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 9, PM USA has issued guarantees relating to Altria's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program. These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on Altria's liquidity.\n\nLong-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, Altria makes interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 9.\n\nPurchase Obligations - Altria has entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2021, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $827 million and $1,274 million thereafter (a decrease from $1,095 million and $2,902 million at December 31, 2020, respectively, driven primarily by the Ste. Michelle Transaction).\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Altria had $609 million of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. Substantially all of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on Altria's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 and are excluded from the amounts above.\n\nPayments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 18, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states and territories of the United States that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 18.\n\nBased on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that Altria's subsidiaries may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $4.4 billion on average for the next three years. These amounts exclude the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.\n\nThe estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. Altria's subsidiaries paid approximately $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results.\n\nLitigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2021, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $50 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAlthough litigation is subject to uncertainty and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on the financial position, cash flows or results of operations of PM USA, UST or Altria in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 18, Item 3 and Item 1A, management expects cash flow from operations, together with Altria's access to capital markets, to provide sufficient liquidity to meet ongoing business needs.\n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities - Altria had $1.5 billion of accrued postretirement health care costs on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 and estimates approximately $100 million of annual payments. In addition, Altria has accrued pension obligations, substantially all of which are funded from plan assets. For further information on Altria's postretirement health care and pension",

      "answer": "MDLZ values its real estate funds using net asset values (NAV) as reported by fund managers, which are supported by periodic appraisals and local market conditions. These NAV-based valuations fall under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as they rely on observable inputs through the fund's reported unit prices. In contrast, PM uses standard valuation models for its derivatives that directly apply readily observable market inputs such as foreign exchange spot rates, interest rate differentials, and maturity dates, which also place these valuations in Level 2. While both companies use Level 2 methodologies, MDLZ\u2019s approach is indirect and dependent on third-party fund valuations, whereas PM\u2019s is direct and based on real-time market data, suggesting differing levels of transparency and control in their fair value measurement processes.",

      "answer": "Indonesia experienced low-single-digit beverage growth as part of PEP's APAC division, which reported 34% net revenue growth driven by acquisitions and volume increases. Meanwhile, CCEP operates as a key bottler and distributor of Coca-Cola products in Indonesia under its broader international footprint.

We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 13-percentagepoint impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, lower charges  taken  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  our  Pioneer  Foods  acquisition  contributed  3 percentage points and 2 percentage points, respectively, to operating profit growth.\n\nChanges in consumer behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a current-year increase in  consumer  demand,  which  had  a  positive  impact  on  net  revenue,  unit  volume  and  operating  profit performance.\n\n## APAC\n\nNet revenue increased 34%, reflecting a 15-percentage-point impact of our Be &amp; Cheery acquisition, which included the impact of an extra month of net revenue compared to the prior year as we aligned Be &amp; Cheery's reporting calendar with that of our APAC division, as well as organic volume growth, a 6- percentage-point impact of favorable foreign exchange and effective net pricing.\n\nConvenient  foods  unit  volume  grew  19%,  primarily  reflecting  a  16-percentage-point  impact  of  our  Be  &amp; Cheery acquisition, which included the impact of an extra month of unit volume as we aligned Be &amp; Cheery's reporting calendar with that of our APAC division, and double-digit growth in China (excluding our Be &amp; Cheery  acquisition)  and  Thailand.

      "answer": "MDLZ uses the prior quarter's interest rate, currency exchange, and commodity price movements to estimate return distributions for VAR calculations at year-end (December 31, 2024 and 2023), and the four prior quarters for average VAR amounts. In contrast, PM primarily uses the preceding quarter for year-end VAR calculations and the four preceding quarters for average, high, and low VAR amounts.

We do not expect to incur penalty payments under these provisions that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## Litigation\n\nWe are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nWe are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment  of  prior  manufacturing  and  waste  disposal  practices.  Based  on  currently  available  information,  we  do  not  believe  the  ultimate  resolution  of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## NOTE 14\n\n## SUPPLIER FINANCE PROGRAMS\n\nThe Company has an ongoing program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers consistent with market practices. The Company also supports a Supply  Chain  Finance  program  ('SCF')  with  several  global  financial  institutions.  Under  SCF ,  the  Company  maintains  an  accounts  payable  system  to  facilitate participating suppliers' ability to sell receivables from the Company to a SCF bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their sales of receivables arrangements directly  with  the  respective  SCF  bank.  The  Company  is  not  party  to  those  agreements,  but  the  SCF  banks  allow  the  suppliers  to  utilize  the  Company's creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. Under this model, this arrangement generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier's decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier chooses to participate in SCF, the supplier selects which individual Company invoices to sell to the SCF bank. The Company's obligations to its suppliers, including the amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the supplier's decisions to finance amounts under these arrangements. The Company does not provide any form of guarantee under these financing arrangements. Our payment terms for suppliers under this program generally range from 60  to 180 days. All outstanding  amounts  related  to  suppliers  participating  in  SCF  are  recorded  within Accounts  payable  in  our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets,  and  the  associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The amount due to suppliers participating in SCF and included in Accounts payable was approximately $5.6 billion as of June 30, 2024 and $5.7 billion as of June 30, 2023.\n\n## NOTE 15\n\n## SUBSEQUENT EVENT\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of its business in Argentina. The Company expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately $750 for accumulated foreign currency translation losses in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.\n\nItem 9.

This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

The Company uses one of our consolidated captive insurance companies to reinsure group annuity insurance contracts that cover the obligations of certain of our European and Canadian pension plans. This captive's solvency capital funds included total equity and debt securities of $1,883 million and $1,643 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were classified in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets because the assets were not available to satisfy our current obligations.\n\n## NOTE 5: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company's financial performance and are referred to as 'market risks.' When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\n\nThe Company uses various types of derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative returns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect ex pected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes) a call option, or alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-derivative instruments, such as our foreign currency denominated third-party debt, in hedging relationships.\n\nAll derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid ex penses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with the same counterparty.\n\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our consolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the values of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings.\n\nFor derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures.\n\nThe Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to Note 17. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency ex change rates, commodity rates or other financial indices.

These non-derivative instruments may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate a portion of our foreign currency-denominated Senior Notes in euros as net investment hedges and the gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are reported as a component of AOCI and remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.\n\nWe have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December 31, 2024, we began entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the foreign exchange risk on intercompany transactions and monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. Certain contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and the gains or losses on these derivative instruments are recorded in 'Interest and other income (expense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We also designate certain contracts as fair value hedges to mitigate the foreign ex change risk on the remeasurement of our foreign-currency denominated debt. The gains or losses on these derivative instruments included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in 'Interest and other income (expense),' net with the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items. If an adverse change in exchange rates of 10% was applied to our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, income before income taxes would have been approximately $38 million and $516 million lower, respectively, after considering the offsetting impact of the foreign currency ex change contracts and our net investment hedges. The decrease in the hypothetical adverse change in income before taxes from $516 million as of December 31, 2023 to $38 million as of December 31, 2024 is primarily driven by our use of non-derivative and derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange risk related to the remeasurement of foreign-currency denominated balances during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n## Item 8.

          "chunk_text": "## ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES\n\nGlobal E conomic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are G reater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and G ermany and collectively comprised approximately 20% of our net sales in fiscal 2024. As a result, we are exposed to global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions and government policies. We are exposed to market risks from operating in challenging environments due to economic, political and social instabilities, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, currency controls, foreign ex change and interest rate changes. These risks can negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. For example, we are exposed to risks due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Our Russia business accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales, net earnings and net assets as of June 30, 2024.\n\nForeign Exchange. We have significant exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, both due to translation and transaction exposures. Translation exposures arise from measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Transaction exposures involve impacts from 1) input costs that are denominated in currencies other than the local reporting currency and 2) revaluation of working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We have experienced significant foreign exchange impacts in the past due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the US dollar, which  have  negatively  impacted  net  sales,  net  earnings  and  cash  flows.  In  response  to  the  devaluation  of  foreign  currencies  (including  those  deemed  highly inflationary), any lags or inability (due to government restrictions) to implement price increases or the negative impacts of such actions on product consumption may lead to a decline in our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nCommodities and  Supply  Chain. Our costs are subject to fluctuations due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, inflationary impacts and productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. V olatility in the market price of commodities and input materials directly affects our costs. Disruptions in manufacturing, supply and distribution  operations  can  lead  to  increased  costs.  Legal  or  regulatory  requirements  and  sustainability  initiatives  may  result  in  increased  costs.  We  strive  to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response  to  certain  inflationary  or  cost  increases  may  also  offset  portions  of  the  cost  impacts;  however,  such  price  increases  may  negatively  impact  product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nGovernment Policies. We are exposed to changes in U.S. and foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies that can have a negative impact on net sales, net earnings and cash flows. These include tax policy changes (both U.S. and foreign), including those resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy'. G overnment controls such as currency exchanges, pricing and import authorizations as well as government policies related to environmental and climate change matters and changes to international trade agreements can also impact our financial performance.\n\nFor additional information on risk factors that could impact our business results, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&amp;A), operating margin, other non-operating items, income taxes and net earnings. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending, retail executions (both in-store and online) and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as our pricing actions (which can also impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign exchange impacts on sales outside the U.S.\n\nFor most of our categories, our cost of products sold and SG &amp;A are variable in nature to some extent. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in North America are generally higher than the Company average for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for ex ample, product or package improvements) and, to a lesser extent, scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SG&amp;A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems' infrastructures to support business growth. The main drivers of changes in  SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments (for example, increased  advertising),  inflation,  foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts.",

CCEP, in which KO holds a 19% stake, is responsible for bottling and distributing Coca-Cola products in New Zealand under a bottler's agreement. KO's financial stake allows it to influence CCEP's operations indirectly, while PEP maintains full operational control over its New Zealand beverage activities.

The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 48 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\n\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

Although these derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in the fair values of economic hedges are immediately recognized in earnings.\n\nThe Company uses foreign currency economic hedges to offset the earnings impact that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies. The changes in the fair values of economic hedges used to offset those monetary assets and liabilities are immediately recognized in earnings in the line item other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income. In addition, we use foreign currency economic hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including those related to certain acquisition and divestiture activities. The changes in the fair values of economic hedges used to offset the variability in U.S. dollar net cash flows are immediately recognized in earnings in the line items net operating revenues, cost of goods sold or other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income, as applicable. The total notional values of derivatives related to our foreign currency economic hedges were $4,258 million and $5,727 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe Company uses interest rate contracts as economic hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. The total notional value of derivatives related to our economic hedges of this type was $200 million as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe Company also uses certain derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process and vehicle fuel. The changes in the fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized in earnings in the line items net operating revenues, cost of goods sold, or selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income, as applicable.

      "answer": "The 10% growth in Vietnam's total tobacco market, attributed to pandemic-related supply disruptions that lowered the prevalence of illicit trade, reflects a positive market development in a country where PMI operates. While PMI's Southeast Asia shipment volumes declined overall by 1.8%, with significant drops in the Philippines and Thailand, Vietnam is not explicitly mentioned in terms of shipment performance. However, the broader context suggests that reduced illicit trade may have supported market expansion in Vietnam.

          "chunk_text": "FDA actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments.\n\nOn  September  29,  2021,  the  International  Trade  Commission  (\"ITC\")  issued  its  Final  Determination  (\"FD\"),  Limited  Exclusion  Order (\"LEO\") and Cease and Desist Order (\"CDO\"). The ITC upheld the finding of infringement in the ID and found a subsequent violation. The ITC issued a LEO prohibiting the importation of infringing tobacco heating articles and components thereof and cease and desist orders against Philip Morris USA, Inc. and Altria Client Services, LLC, which went into effect at the end of the 60-day Presidential review period on November 28, 2021. We have appealed the patent issues. Furthermore, lawsuits based on the same patent families have been repeatedly and universally rejected in European courts and the European Patent Office. The decision has no bearing outside the United States.\n\nUntil  recently,  there  were  no  countries  with  specific  product  standards  for  heat-not-burn  products.  Currently,  national  standards  setting minimum  quality  and  safety  requirements  for  such  products  have  been  adopted  in  several  countries  with  technical  heat-not-burn specifications and/or methods for demonstrating the absence of combustion. They are mandatory in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, the UAE, Uzbekistan and Bahrain, and voluntary in Armenia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Vietnam, the  U.K.  and  Ukraine.  In  Japan,  a  voluntary  standard  sets  minimum  safety  requirements  for  tobacco  heating  devices.  We  expect  other governments to consider similar product standards and encourage making them mandatory.\n\nAll EU member states have transposed the EU Tobacco Products Directive, including the provisions on novel tobacco products, such as heated  tobacco  units,  and  e-cigarettes.  Most  of  the  EU  member  states  require  a  notification  submitted  six  months  before  the  intended placing on the market of such products, while some require pre-market authorizations for the introduction of such products. To date, we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of our Platform 1 product in over 20 member states.\n\nIn addition, in Italy, in April 2018, we submitted an application for HEETS , used with the IQOS device, requesting regulatory recognition of the  reduction  of  toxic  substances  and  potential  risk  reduction  resulting  from  switching  to  this  product  compared  to  continued  cigarette smoking. In January 2019, our application was not granted primarily on the grounds of insufficient data and questions of methodology.  Due to the constraints of the review process, we had been unable to supplement the application with all the data we subsequently filed with the FDA and to address methodological questions during the review. We plan to submit a new application where we will clarify the concerns raised by the decision and further strengthen our application by submitting additional evidence that became available since we submitted our first application, consistent with our FDA filings. We are confident that our evidence supports our application.\n\nOn October 31, 2019, our Australian subsidiary, Philip Morris Limited ('PML'), submitted an application to the Scheduling Committee of the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia ('TGA') seeking to exempt heated tobacco products from being prohibited in Australia. In August 2020, the TGA issued its decision denying the application and stating that it did not present compelling evidence to establish a public health benefit from greater access to nicotine in heated tobacco products.\n\nTo date, several governmental agencies have published their scientific findings that analyze the harm-reduction potential of certain RRPs versus continuing smoking, including:\n\nIn December 2017, at the request of the U.K. Department of Health and Public Health England, the U.K. Committee on Toxicity published its assessment of the risk of heat-not-burn products relative to cigarette smoking. This assessment included analysis of scientific data for two  heat-not-burn  products,  one  of  which  was  our  Platform  1  product.  The  assessment  concluded  that,  while  still  harmful  to  health, compared with the known risks from cigarettes, heat-not-burn products are probably less harmful. Subsequently, in February 2018, Public Health England published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heat-not-burn products may be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than e-cigarettes.\n\nIn May 2018, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment ('BfR') published a study on the Platform 1 aerosol relative to cigarette smoke using the Health Canada Intense Smoking Regimen. BfR found reductions in selected HPHCs in a range of 80-99%. This publication indicates that significant reductions in the levels of selected toxicants are likely to reduce toxicant exposure, which BfR stated might be regarded as a discrete benefit compared to combustible cigarettes.\n\nIn May 2018, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment ('RIVM') published a factsheet on novel tobacco products that heat rather than burn tobacco, focusing on our Platform 1 product. RIVM analyzed the aerosol generated by our Platform 1 product and concluded that the use of this product, while still harmful to health, is probably less harmful than continued smoking.",

Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our tobacco operating companies' and investees' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes; imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact Altria's consolidated results of operations and cash flows, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL, and the businesses of its tobacco operating companies and investees; or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies communicate with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities, enforce wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products and, when necessary, litigate to protect their trademarks.\n\n## Price, Availability and Quality of Tobacco, Other Raw Materials, Ingredients and Component Parts\n\nShifts in crops (such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns), government restrictions and mandated prices, production control programs, economic trade sanctions, import duties and tariffs, international trade disruptions, inflation, geopolitical instability, climate and environmental changes and disruptions due to man-made or natural disasters may increase the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco or other raw materials or ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our companies' and our investees' products. Any significant change in the price, availability or quality of tobacco, other raw materials, ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our products and those of our investees could restrict our tobacco operating companies' and investees' ability to continue manufacturing and marketing existing products or impact adult consumer product acceptability and adversely affect our tobacco operating companies' and investees' profitability and businesses.\n\nWith respect to tobacco, as with other agricultural commodities, crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. Additionally, the price and availability of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand. Economic conditions, including inflation and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, are unpredictable, which, among other factors, may result in changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production which could negatively impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply. In addition, as consumer demand increases for smoke-free products and decreases for combustible products, the volume of tobacco leaf required for production may decrease. The reduced demand for tobacco leaf may result in the reduced supply and availability of domestic tobacco as growers divert resources to other crops, which could result in increased costs to our tobacco operating companies.\n\nTobacco production in certain countries also is subject to a variety of controls, including government-mandated prices and production control programs.  Moreover, certain types of tobacco are only available in limited geographies, including geographies experiencing political instability or government prohibitions on the import or export of tobacco, and loss of their availability could impair our subsidiaries' ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also may limit access to and increase the cost of raw materials, component parts and personal protective equipment as United States and global suppliers may temporarily shut down facilities or use different production schedules with lower productivity in order to address exposure to the virus or as a result of a government mandate. In addition, (i) current labor market dynamics indicate labor shortages, with employers in a number of industries having difficulty employing workers and (ii) supply chain dynamics reflect failures and delays resulting from various issues including labor shortages, logistical problems and weather-related incidents. These labor shortages and supply failures and delays have led to certain increases in raw material (for example, resins used in our packaging), ingredient and component part prices and may lead to supply chain disruptions; however, to date, the impact on our operating companies and investees has been immaterial. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, labor market dynamics and supply chain disruptions outlined above may continue, which could adversely affect our subsidiaries' and investees' profitability and businesses. Recent economic conditions reflect an increased rate of inflation. To date, higher inflation has not had a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability. Although Altria anticipates inflation will continue at elevated levels in 2022, it is not expected to have a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability.\n\nIn addition, government taxes, restrictions and prohibitions on the sale and use of certain products may limit access to, and increase the costs of, raw materials and component parts and, potentially, impede our ability to sell certain of our products.

      "answer": "PM's 2022 10-K reports an 8.2% increase in the total cigarette market in Turkey, driven by easing pandemic restrictions and increased tourism, but partly offset by a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade.

PEP's 2022 10-K explicitly lists Turkey among the markets where volatile economic, political, and social conditions\u2014including currency controls and fluctuations\u2014create challenging operating environments. Since PEP operates in Turkey and is exposed to foreign exchange risk in this market, the instability caused by illicit trade (as seen in PM's segment data) could exacerbate currency volatility and economic uncertainty, which PEP must hedge against using foreign exchange derivatives.

Excluding a favorable currency impact of $0.12, diluted EPS increased by 10.7%.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019\n\nFor a discussion comparing our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, with the year ended December 31, 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Discussion and Analysis - Consolidated Operating Results in  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2021.\n\n## Operating Results by Business Segment\n\n## Business Environment\n\n## Taxes, Legislation, Regulation and Other Matters Regarding the Manufacture, Marketing, Sale and Use of Tobacco Products\n\nThe tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash  flows  and  financial  position.  These  challenges,  which  are  discussed  below  and  in  ' Cautionary  Factors  That  May  Affect  Future Results ,' include:\n\n- regulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other nicotinecontaining products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or even ban certain of our products;\n- fiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;\n- illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called 'illicit whites';\n- intense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;\n- pending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies ; and\n- governmental investigations.\n\nRegulatory  Restrictions: The  tobacco  industry  operates  in  a  highly  regulated  environment.  The  well-known  risks  of  smoking  have  led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.\n\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  (the  'FCTC')  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (the  \"WHO\"),  which  entered  into  force  in  2005.  The  FCTC  has  as  its  main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others.  The  FCTC  governing  body,  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  ('CoP'),  has  also  adopted  non-binding  guidelines  and  policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty. In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for  more  scientific  assessment  and  improved  reporting  to  define  policy  on  heated  tobacco  products.  Similar  to  its  previous  policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\n\nPrior to CoP 9 that took place in November 2021, the WHO and the WHO FCTC Secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products. The reports were noted by CoP 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to CoP 10, currently scheduled  for  2023.  It  is  not  possible  to  predict  whether  or  to  what  extent  measures  recommended  by  the  WHO's  reports  will  be implemented as the reports are not binding to the WHO Member States.\n\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today, but how fast, and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that recognize a significant difference on a risk continuum between combustible tobacco on the one hand and non-combustible tobacco and other nicotine-containing products on the other. Regulation should include measures that will accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such products to",

As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks  in  the  international  markets  in  which  our  products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2021,  favorable  foreign  exchange  contributed  1  percentage  point  to  net  revenue  growth,  primarily  due  to appreciation  in  the  Mexican  peso,  Canadian  dollar  and  South African  rand.  Currency  declines  against  the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.\n\nIn addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold,  including  in Argentina,  Brazil,  China,  Mexico,  the Middle  East,  Russia  and  Turkey,  and  currency  controls  or  fluctuations  in  certain  of  these  international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments.\n\nOur foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $1.9 billion  as  of  December 26, 2020. At the end of 2021, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $278 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.\n\nThe total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nOur interest  rate  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $2.1  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $3.0 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  Assuming  year-end  2021  investment  levels  and  variable  rate  debt,  a  1percentage-point  increase  in  interest  rates  would  have  decreased  our  net  interest  expense  in  2021  by  $47 million  due  to  higher  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  levels,  as  compared  with  our variable rate debt.\n\n## OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\n## Results of Operations - Consolidated Review\n\n## Volume\n\nPhysical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions,  including  the  preparation  of  our  annual  operating  plan  and  the  evaluation  of  our  business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level.",

      "question": "What is the total financial exposure represented by appeal bonds posted by PM USA in relation to U.S. tobacco litigation, and how does this compare to the Canadian litigation liabilities faced by PM and its indemnitees, including PM USA, as of December 31, 2023?",
      "answer": "As of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million related to U.S. tobacco litigation, which were collateralized with restricted cash. In Canada, PM and its indemnitees, including PM USA, faced litigation liabilities such as the L\u00e9tourneau case, where PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $194 million (net of tax: $142 million) representing RBH\u2019s share of the judgment, and the Blais case, which required a deposit of approximately $813 million into trust accounts, with RBH's share at approximately $194 million. These figures illustrate that while the U.S. exposure is currently limited to $35 million in appeal bonds, the Canadian litigation liabilities are significantly higher, with specific cases already triggering substantial financial obligations.",

In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 10, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Long-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates. For information on annual debt maturities and interest payments, see Note 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Purchase Obligations - We have entered into purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and services, contract manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution) and other commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase Bank served as the Administrative Agent for MDLZ's Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement dated February 23, 2022, while in CL's Five-Year Credit Agreement dated November 4, 2022, Citibank, N.A. was the Administrative Agent. In both cases, JPMorgan was part of a syndicate of lenders, but the differing agent roles suggest varying structuring approaches by the companies despite similar credit facility frameworks.",

        "Hop 1: MDLZ \u2192 JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.: MDLZ's 2022 Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement specifically names JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Administrative Agent",

      "question": "How does KO's reliance on Coca-Cola FEMSA for distribution in Argentina compare to MDLZ's exposure to economic volatility in the same market, given Coca-Cola FEMSA's specific operational footprint and MDLZ's inflation-related financial impacts?",
      "answer": "KO relies on Coca-Cola FEMSA for distribution in parts of Argentina, specifically the federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas, as part of its broader network of equity method investees to whom it sold $14.471 billion in net sales in 2021. Coca-Cola FEMSA operates in Argentina, a market that has been classified as highly inflationary since mid-2018, which directly affects MDLZ\u2019s operations there. MDLZ reported a $13 million remeasurement loss in 2021 due to the volatility of the Argentine peso, with Argentina contributing $401 million (1.4%) to MDLZ\u2019s consolidated net revenues. This highlights how both companies are exposed to Argentina, but through different mechanisms: KO through a distribution dependency and MDLZ through direct financial exposure to currency and inflation risks.",

        "Hop 1: KO \u2192 Coca-Cola FEMSA: KO depends on Coca-Cola FEMSA for distribution in parts of Argentina, including the federal capital and surrounding areas, and sold $14.471 billion in net sales to equity method investees in 2021.",

Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 42 percent of U.S. unit case volume. Unit case volume outside the United States represented 83 percent of the Company's worldwide unit case volume in 2021. The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 48 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\n\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nArgentina. During the second quarter of 2018, primarily based on published estimates that indicated Argentina's threeyear cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%, we concluded that Argentina became a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes. As of July 1, 2018, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our Argentinean subsidiaries and changed their functional currency from the Argentinean peso to the U.S. dollar. On July 1, 2018, both monetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Argentinean pesos were remeasured into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, with remeasurement and other transaction gains and losses recorded in net earnings. As of December 31, 2021, our Argentinean operations had $9 million of Argentinean peso denominated net monetary assets. Our Argentinean operations contributed $401 million, or 1.4% of consolidated net revenues in 2021. We recorded a remeasurement loss of $13 million in 2021, a remeasurement loss of $9 million in 2020 and a remeasurement gain of $4 million in 2019 within selling, general and administrative expenses related to the revaluation of the Argentinean peso denominated net monetary position over these periods.\n\nBrexit . Following the separation of the United Kingdom from the European Union ('Brexit') in 2020, a new trade arrangement was reached between the U.K. and E.U. that began on January 1, 2021. The main trade provisions include the continuation of no tariffs or quotas on trade between the U.K. and E.U. subject to prescribed trade terms, including but not limited to meeting product and labeling standards for both the U.K. and E.U. Cross-border trade between the U.K. and E.U. is also subject to new customs regulations, documentation and reviews. To comply with the new requirements, we increased resources in customer service and logistics, in our factories, and on our customs support teams. We adapted our processes and systems for the new and increased number of customs transactions. We continue to closely monitor and manage our inventory levels of imported raw materials, packaging and finished goods in the U.K. We have made investments in resources, systems and processes to meet the new ongoing requirements and we work to mitigate disruptions to our local supply chain and distribution, including those related to the recent transportation labor shortage in the U.K., to reduce the impact on our input and distribution costs. Despite our efforts to control costs, we have seen inflationary cost pressures rise in our U.K. business this year, as we have also experienced in other markets. If the U.K.'s separation from, or new trade arrangements with, the E.U. negatively impact the U.K. economy or result in disagreements on trade terms, delays affecting our supply chain or distribution, disruptions to sales or collections, or further increases in inflationary cost pressures, the impact to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be material. In 2021, we generated 9.3% of our net revenues in the U.K.\n\nOther Countries . Since we sell our products in over 150 countries and have operations in approximately 80 countries, we monitor economic and currency-related risks and seek to take protective measures in response to these exposures. We continue to monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts to our `business operations, currencies and net monetary exposures. Since the global onset of COVID-19 in early 2020, most countries in which we do business experienced periods of significant economic uncertainty as well as exchange rate volatility. At this time, except for Argentina which is accounted for as a highly inflationary economy, we do not anticipate any other countries in which we operate to be at risk of becoming highly inflationary economies.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash:\n\nCash and cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. We also had restricted cash within other current assets of $7 million as of December 31, 2021 and $31 million as of December 31, 2020. Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $3,553 million as of December 31, 2021 and $3,650 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Allowances for Credit Losses:\n\nThe allowances for credit losses are recorded against our receivables. They are developed at a country and region level based on historical collection experiences, current economic condition of specific customers and the forecasted economic condition of countries using various factors such as bond default rates and consumption indexes. We write off receivables once it is determined that the receivables are no longer collectible and as allowed by local laws.",

      "answer": "PG highlighted Turkey as a market where foreign exchange volatility and government policy changes have significantly impacted its historical net sales, costs, and earnings, and where it actively manages exposures related to currency and import controls. In 2022, Turkey\u2019s cigarette market grew by 8.2%, driven by increased adult smoker consumption and tourism, but partly offset by a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade. MO noted that illicit trade in tobacco products\u2014such as counterfeit goods and untaxed sales\u2014negatively affects profitability, undermines distribution investments, and risks triggering retaliatory tax or regulatory actions from governments facing lost revenues. Therefore, PG\u2019s financial exposure in Turkey is not only tied to macroeconomic volatility but also indirectly to illicit trade dynamics that MO has identified as a systemic threat to the tobacco industry\u2019s profitability and operational stability.",

Net  sales  could  also  be  adversely  impacted  following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on the consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including     supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. If we  are not successful in  executing  and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our  gross  margin,  operating  margin,  net  earnings  and  cash flows.\n\nForeign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure  to  the  fluctuation  of  exchange  rates.  Translation exposures relate to exchange  rate impacts of  measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a  currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation  of  transaction-related  working  capital  balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In  the  past  three  years,  a  number  of  foreign  currencies  have weakened  versus  the  U.S.  dollar,  leading  to  lower  sales  and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries  that  recently  had  and  are  currently  experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Russia. These fluctuations have significantly  impacted  our  historical  net  sales,  costs  and  net earnings  and  could  do  so  in  the  future.  Increased  pricing  in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  may  offset  portions  of  the  currency  impacts  but  could also  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  consumption  of  our products,  which  would  negatively  affect  our  net  sales,  gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nGovernment Policies. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative,  regulatory  or  enforcement  policies.  For  example, our  net  earnings  and  cash  flows  could  be  affected  by  any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under  the  current  work  being  led  by  the  OECD  for  the  G20 focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the  Economy.\"  The  breadth  of  the  OECD  project  extends beyond pure digital businesses, and if agreed and enacted by most  countries,  is  likely  to  impact  most  large  multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and broadly  establishing  a  15%  minimum  tax  on  their  foreign operations. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and  climate change  matters.  Additionally, we  attempt  to carefully  manage  our  debt,  currency  and  other  exposures  in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and  pricing  controls,  such  as  Nigeria,  Turkey, Argentina  and Egypt. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere.  Changes  in  government  policies  in  these  areas might  cause  an  increase  or  decrease  in  our  net  sales,  gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nCOVID-19  Pandemic. Because  we  sell  products  that  are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nHowever, the continued evolution of the pandemic may result in economic recessions or a slowdown of economic growth in certain countries or regions. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products (due to governmental actions or  key  material,  transportation  and  labor  shortages  impacting our  ability  to  produce  and  ship  products)  or  could  impact consumers'  movements  and  access  to  our  products.  There could also be reduced demand due to consumption decreases and consumer pantry destocking (particularly, in home cleaning,  health  and  hygiene  products)  as  economic  activity resumes  following  slowdowns  or  relaxation  of  governmental restrictions.  Net,  the  uncertainty  in  the  timing  and  extent  of demand  volatility,  the  relaxation  and  reimplementation  of movement  restrictions,  the  timing  and  impact  of  potential consumer pantry destocking, the future economic trends due to a  resurgence  of  positive  cases  and  governmental  actions  in response  to  the  pandemic  may  result  in  heightened  volatility and negative impacts to net sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the pandemic.\n\nWhile we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets due primarily to the restriction of employee movements, key material and labor shortages and transportation constraints. We intend to continue to work with our suppliers and government authorities to implement employee  safety  measures  to  minimize  disruption  to  the manufacturing and distribution of our products. The continued evolution of the pandemic and uncertainty with regards to the disruptions  caused  either  by  resurgence  of  positive  cases  or governmental actions in response to the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain and impact our operations (for example, the closure of a key manufacturing or distribution  facility  or  the  inability  of  a  key  material  or transportation supplier to source and transport materials).\n\nThe pandemic has not had a material negative impact on the Company's liquidity position. We continue to generate operating  cash  flows  to  meet  our  short-term  liquidity  needs and continue to maintain access to capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings.\n\nRussia-Ukraine  War .  The  war  between  Russia  and  Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both countries. Our Ukraine  business  includes  two  manufacturing  sites.  We  have approximately  500  employees  including  both  manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. Our operations in Ukraine accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in fiscal 2022. Additionally, net assets of our Ukraine subsidiary, along",

Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our tobacco operating companies' and investees' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes; imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact Altria's consolidated results of operations and cash flows, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL, and the businesses of its tobacco operating companies and investees; or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies communicate with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities, enforce wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products and, when necessary, litigate to protect their trademarks.\n\n## Price, Availability and Quality of Tobacco, Other Raw Materials, Ingredients and Component Parts\n\nShifts in crops (such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns), government restrictions and mandated prices, production control programs, economic trade sanctions, import duties and tariffs, international trade disruptions, inflation, geopolitical instability, climate and environmental changes and disruptions due to man-made or natural disasters may increase the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco or other raw materials or ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our companies' and our investees' products. Any significant change in the price, availability or quality of tobacco, other raw materials, ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our products and those of our investees could restrict our tobacco operating companies' and investees' ability to continue manufacturing and marketing existing products or impact adult consumer product acceptability and adversely affect our tobacco operating companies' and investees' profitability and businesses.\n\nWith respect to tobacco, as with other agricultural commodities, crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. Additionally, the price and availability of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand. Economic conditions, including inflation and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, are unpredictable, which, among other factors, may result in changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production which could negatively impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply. In addition, as consumer demand increases for smoke-free products and decreases for combustible products, the volume of tobacco leaf required for production may decrease. The reduced demand for tobacco leaf may result in the reduced supply and availability of domestic tobacco as growers divert resources to other crops, which could result in increased costs to our tobacco operating companies.\n\nTobacco production in certain countries also is subject to a variety of controls, including government-mandated prices and production control programs.  Moreover, certain types of tobacco are only available in limited geographies, including geographies experiencing political instability or government prohibitions on the import or export of tobacco, and loss of their availability could impair our subsidiaries' ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also may limit access to and increase the cost of raw materials, component parts and personal protective equipment as United States and global suppliers may temporarily shut down facilities or use different production schedules with lower productivity in order to address exposure to the virus or as a result of a government mandate. In addition, (i) current labor market dynamics indicate labor shortages, with employers in a number of industries having difficulty employing workers and (ii) supply chain dynamics reflect failures and delays resulting from various issues including labor shortages, logistical problems and weather-related incidents. These labor shortages and supply failures and delays have led to certain increases in raw material (for example, resins used in our packaging), ingredient and component part prices and may lead to supply chain disruptions; however, to date, the impact on our operating companies and investees has been immaterial. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, labor market dynamics and supply chain disruptions outlined above may continue, which could adversely affect our subsidiaries' and investees' profitability and businesses. Recent economic conditions reflect an increased rate of inflation. To date, higher inflation has not had a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability. Although Altria anticipates inflation will continue at elevated levels in 2022, it is not expected to have a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability.\n\nIn addition, government taxes, restrictions and prohibitions on the sale and use of certain products may limit access to, and increase the costs of, raw materials and component parts and, potentially, impede our ability to sell certain of our products.

      "answer": "PEP's beverage unit volume in the Philippines grew by low-single digits, with net revenue in APAC facing a 2-percentage-point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange translation. Meanwhile, PM operates in Thailand, where a long-standing trade dispute with the Philippines over customs valuation and tax treatment of cigarette imports remains unresolved, creating regulatory uncertainty. This trade dispute, initiated after a WTO panel decision in 2010, has led to ongoing bilateral discussions but no final resolution, potentially exacerbating foreign exchange and regulatory risks for companies operating in either country. The combination of FX pressures and unresolved trade tensions suggests both firms face compounding cross-border operational challenges, though PEP's exposure is more cost-driven while PM's is regulatory and legal in nature.",

          "chunk_text": "## Governmental Investigations\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters, including tax, customs, antitrust, advertising, and labor practices. We describe certain pending matters in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies .\n\nIn November 2010, a World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") panel issued its decision in a dispute between the Philippines and Thailand, concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\") into Thailand. The decision concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the Thai government and created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports.  Thailand agreed to fully comply with the decision, but the Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision and commenced challenges at the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO Appellate Body is not operational, and the appeals by Thailand are suspended indefinitely. In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues and the countries have since agreed to seek the establishment of a bilateral consultative mechanism, with the goal of reaching a comprehensive settlement of their dispute, consistent with their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreements, as well as the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families in the country. We continue commercial activities in select locations where safety allows, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and supplies the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement. Production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended. On June 20, 2023, we announced the investment of $30 million in a new production facility in the Lviv region, in Western Ukraine. Preparatory work for the facility began in July 2023. The new production facility was completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and local production commenced in April 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our Ukrainian operations had approximately $0.6 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances.\n\nIn Russia, we are continuously assessing the evolving situation in the country. This includes regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. As of December 31, 2024, our Russian operations had approximately $2.7 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $1.0 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles).\n\nAdditionally, we hold a 23% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution B.V ., which was the holding company of JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), pursuant to Dutch law, PMI's distributor in Russia. On July 18, 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Trade filed a petition before the Arbitrazh Court of Moscow seeking the forced localization of JSC TK Megapolis. On December 5, 2024, JSC TK Megapolis registered the transfer of this equity interest to PMI affiliate ZAO Philip Morris Izhora. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. Related Parties - Equity Investments and Other and Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies.\n\nThese developments above have or may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in impairment charges.\n\nFor further details, see Item 1A. Risk Factors , Item 8, Note 4. War in Ukraine and the \"Trade Policy \" section of this Item 7.\n\n## Impact of Inflation on Our Business and Mitigation E fforts\n\nLike many other global companies, we have experienced inflationary pressures in 2022, 2023 and 2024, including: growing pressures on the cost of certain direct materials, wages, energy, transportation, and logistics as well as an increased cost of capital due to interest rate increases driven by the response to increased inflation. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact on cost of sales was approximately $580 million. In 2024, the impact on cost of sales was approximately 30% of the 2023 level, benefiting from lower prices for direct materials and utilities, despite continued pressure on tobacco leaf costs. In 2025, we expect certain inflationary elements such as direct materials and utilities to stabilize, with a moderate overall increase in inflationary pressures driven by tobacco leaf costs.\n\nInflationary impacts driven by higher wages have resulted from merit increases that reflect local inflation as we continuously evaluate our compensation and benefit offerings to be competitive with the current market. Increased transportation costs resulted from increased shipping rates for all modes of transportation (air, ocean and inland) due to ocean and air capacity constraints. Increases in",

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions; erosion of consumer confidence; competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products; adult smoker willingness to convert to our SFPs; higher product taxes; higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories; unfair competition; and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products, restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our SFPs, or disproportionately impacts the commercialization of our products in relation to our competitors.\n\nCompetitors in our industry include Altria G roup, Inc., British American Tobacco plc, Japan Tobacco Inc., Imperial Brands plc, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, China,  Taiwan,  Thailand  and  V ietnam.  Some  competitors  have  different  profit,  volume  and  regulatory  objectives,  some  international  competitors  may  be  less susceptible than  PMI to changes in currency exchange rates, and some competitors may sell products in circumvention of applicable regulations that compete directly  with  our  products.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative  products  through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior product satisfaction, and without scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our SFPs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. See Item 1, Business-Competition for a description of the competitive environment in which we operate.\n\n## We may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences.\n\nOur  business  is  subject  to  changes  in  adult  consumer  preferences,  which  may  be  influenced  by  local  economic  conditions,  accessibility  to  our  products  and availability of accurate information related to our products.\n\n## To be successful, we must:\n\n- promote brand equity successfully;\n- anticipate and respond to new adult consumer trends;\n- ensure that our products meet our quality standards;\n- develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios;\n- improve productivity;\n- educate and encourage adult smokers to convert to our SFPs;\n- ensure effective adult consumer engagement, including communication about product characteristics and usage of SFPs;\n- mitigate the impact of developments that cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands;\n- provide excellent customer care;\n- ensure adequate production capacity to meet demand for our products; and\n- be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases.\n\nIn periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may tend to purchase low-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could be materially adversely impacted as a result. Such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation. In addition to economic uncertainty (including recessions and inflation) unusual weather events and global or local epidemics, endemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19) has and may change the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for our mid-price or premium-price brands.\n\n## Our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets, maintain sufficient production capacity, or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.\n\nOur profit growth may be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to meet the demand for our products with increased production capacity, to raise prices, or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.",

          "chunk_text": "FDA actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments.\n\nOn  September  29,  2021,  the  International  Trade  Commission  (\"ITC\")  issued  its  Final  Determination  (\"FD\"),  Limited  Exclusion  Order (\"LEO\") and Cease and Desist Order (\"CDO\"). The ITC upheld the finding of infringement in the ID and found a subsequent violation. The ITC issued a LEO prohibiting the importation of infringing tobacco heating articles and components thereof and cease and desist orders against Philip Morris USA, Inc. and Altria Client Services, LLC, which went into effect at the end of the 60-day Presidential review period on November 28, 2021. We have appealed the patent issues. Furthermore, lawsuits based on the same patent families have been repeatedly and universally rejected in European courts and the European Patent Office. The decision has no bearing outside the United States.\n\nUntil  recently,  there  were  no  countries  with  specific  product  standards  for  heat-not-burn  products.  Currently,  national  standards  setting minimum  quality  and  safety  requirements  for  such  products  have  been  adopted  in  several  countries  with  technical  heat-not-burn specifications and/or methods for demonstrating the absence of combustion. They are mandatory in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, the UAE, Uzbekistan and Bahrain, and voluntary in Armenia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Vietnam, the  U.K.  and  Ukraine.  In  Japan,  a  voluntary  standard  sets  minimum  safety  requirements  for  tobacco  heating  devices.  We  expect  other governments to consider similar product standards and encourage making them mandatory.\n\nAll EU member states have transposed the EU Tobacco Products Directive, including the provisions on novel tobacco products, such as heated  tobacco  units,  and  e-cigarettes.  Most  of  the  EU  member  states  require  a  notification  submitted  six  months  before  the  intended placing on the market of such products, while some require pre-market authorizations for the introduction of such products. To date, we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of our Platform 1 product in over 20 member states.\n\nIn addition, in Italy, in April 2018, we submitted an application for HEETS , used with the IQOS device, requesting regulatory recognition of the  reduction  of  toxic  substances  and  potential  risk  reduction  resulting  from  switching  to  this  product  compared  to  continued  cigarette smoking. In January 2019, our application was not granted primarily on the grounds of insufficient data and questions of methodology.  Due to the constraints of the review process, we had been unable to supplement the application with all the data we subsequently filed with the FDA and to address methodological questions during the review. We plan to submit a new application where we will clarify the concerns raised by the decision and further strengthen our application by submitting additional evidence that became available since we submitted our first application, consistent with our FDA filings. We are confident that our evidence supports our application.\n\nOn October 31, 2019, our Australian subsidiary, Philip Morris Limited ('PML'), submitted an application to the Scheduling Committee of the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia ('TGA') seeking to exempt heated tobacco products from being prohibited in Australia. In August 2020, the TGA issued its decision denying the application and stating that it did not present compelling evidence to establish a public health benefit from greater access to nicotine in heated tobacco products.\n\nTo date, several governmental agencies have published their scientific findings that analyze the harm-reduction potential of certain RRPs versus continuing smoking, including:\n\nIn December 2017, at the request of the U.K. Department of Health and Public Health England, the U.K. Committee on Toxicity published its assessment of the risk of heat-not-burn products relative to cigarette smoking. This assessment included analysis of scientific data for two  heat-not-burn  products,  one  of  which  was  our  Platform  1  product.  The  assessment  concluded  that,  while  still  harmful  to  health, compared with the known risks from cigarettes, heat-not-burn products are probably less harmful. Subsequently, in February 2018, Public Health England published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heat-not-burn products may be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than e-cigarettes.\n\nIn May 2018, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment ('BfR') published a study on the Platform 1 aerosol relative to cigarette smoke using the Health Canada Intense Smoking Regimen. BfR found reductions in selected HPHCs in a range of 80-99%. This publication indicates that significant reductions in the levels of selected toxicants are likely to reduce toxicant exposure, which BfR stated might be regarded as a discrete benefit compared to combustible cigarettes.\n\nIn May 2018, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment ('RIVM') published a factsheet on novel tobacco products that heat rather than burn tobacco, focusing on our Platform 1 product. RIVM analyzed the aerosol generated by our Platform 1 product and concluded that the use of this product, while still harmful to health, is probably less harmful than continued smoking.",

Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our tobacco operating companies' and investees' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes; imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact Altria's consolidated results of operations and cash flows, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL, and the businesses of its tobacco operating companies and investees; or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies communicate with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities, enforce wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products and, when necessary, litigate to protect their trademarks.\n\n## Price, Availability and Quality of Tobacco, Other Raw Materials, Ingredients and Component Parts\n\nShifts in crops (such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns), government restrictions and mandated prices, production control programs, economic trade sanctions, import duties and tariffs, international trade disruptions, inflation, geopolitical instability, climate and environmental changes and disruptions due to man-made or natural disasters may increase the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco or other raw materials or ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our companies' and our investees' products. Any significant change in the price, availability or quality of tobacco, other raw materials, ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our products and those of our investees could restrict our tobacco operating companies' and investees' ability to continue manufacturing and marketing existing products or impact adult consumer product acceptability and adversely affect our tobacco operating companies' and investees' profitability and businesses.\n\nWith respect to tobacco, as with other agricultural commodities, crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. Additionally, the price and availability of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand. Economic conditions, including inflation and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, are unpredictable, which, among other factors, may result in changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production which could negatively impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply. In addition, as consumer demand increases for smoke-free products and decreases for combustible products, the volume of tobacco leaf required for production may decrease. The reduced demand for tobacco leaf may result in the reduced supply and availability of domestic tobacco as growers divert resources to other crops, which could result in increased costs to our tobacco operating companies.\n\nTobacco production in certain countries also is subject to a variety of controls, including government-mandated prices and production control programs.  Moreover, certain types of tobacco are only available in limited geographies, including geographies experiencing political instability or government prohibitions on the import or export of tobacco, and loss of their availability could impair our subsidiaries' ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also may limit access to and increase the cost of raw materials, component parts and personal protective equipment as United States and global suppliers may temporarily shut down facilities or use different production schedules with lower productivity in order to address exposure to the virus or as a result of a government mandate. In addition, (i) current labor market dynamics indicate labor shortages, with employers in a number of industries having difficulty employing workers and (ii) supply chain dynamics reflect failures and delays resulting from various issues including labor shortages, logistical problems and weather-related incidents. These labor shortages and supply failures and delays have led to certain increases in raw material (for example, resins used in our packaging), ingredient and component part prices and may lead to supply chain disruptions; however, to date, the impact on our operating companies and investees has been immaterial. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, labor market dynamics and supply chain disruptions outlined above may continue, which could adversely affect our subsidiaries' and investees' profitability and businesses. Recent economic conditions reflect an increased rate of inflation. To date, higher inflation has not had a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability. Although Altria anticipates inflation will continue at elevated levels in 2022, it is not expected to have a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability.\n\nIn addition, government taxes, restrictions and prohibitions on the sale and use of certain products may limit access to, and increase the costs of, raw materials and component parts and, potentially, impede our ability to sell certain of our products.

Meanwhile, PepsiCo (PEP) allocates 30% of its Beverages business to the AMESA region (which includes Africa and the Middle East), indicating a significant operational focus in that market. This comparison reveals that while both companies operate in the beverages segment within the region, PEP's proportional emphasis on beverages in AMESA is more pronounced (30% of its global beverage business), whereas MDLZ's beverage revenue in AMEA is a smaller portion of its overall beverage revenue globally ($525 million out of $1,096 million total beverage revenue in 2024).",

      "answer": "MDLZ generated $437 million in revenue from Cheese & Grocery products in the AMEA region in 2022, which represented 1.7% of its total global net revenues. This indicates a moderate but distinct presence of Cheese & Grocery in the AMEA region. Meanwhile, PEP operates in the AMEA region and is actively involved in both beverage and convenient food segments, including joint ventures like the one with Unilever for ready-to-drink tea products. This suggests that while MDLZ has a defined footprint in AMEA through its Cheese & Grocery category, PEP's operational scope in the region is broader and includes strategic partnerships to strengthen its consumer goods presence.",

Meanwhile, ASU No. 2023-07, adopted by MO, mandates incremental disclosures of disaggregated expense information for reportable segments, which MO began applying in 2024 with expanded footnote disclosures in Note 17. Since both companies are subject to ASU No. 2023-07 and have undergone changes to their segment reporting frameworks\u2014PM through internal restructuring and MO through compliance with new accounting standards\u2014their disclosures will reflect different bases for segment presentation, complicating direct comparability of segment performance metrics such as net revenues and operating losses.",

We included expanded footnote disclosures as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2023-07 in Note 17. Segment Reporting . We will include interim disclosure requirements in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements beginning in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n## Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. We record cash equivalents at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.\n- Depreciation, Amortization and Impairment Testing: We record property, plant and equipment at historical costs and depreciate by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate machinery and equipment over periods up to 20 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years. We amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years.\n\nWe review long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If we determine that an impairment ex ists, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. We base impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. We also review the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.\n\nWe conduct a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment as of October 1 of each year, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require us to perform an interim review. We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If necessary, we will perform a single step quantitative impairment test. Additionally, we have the option to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, goodwill is considered impaired. We measure the amount of impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a reporting unit; however, the amount of the impairment loss is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset ex ceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, we consider the intangible asset impaired and reduce the carrying value to fair value in the period identified.\n\n- Derivative Financial Instruments: From time to time, we enter into derivatives to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks, including foreign currency exchange rate risk. We use various types of derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, options and swaps.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities. We designate derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges at the inception of the contracts. For fair value hedges, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative, as well as the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item, in the consolidated statements of earnings each period. For cash flow hedges, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative each period in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) and reclassify changes to the consolidated statements of earnings in the same periods in which operating results are affected by the respective hedged item. For net investment hedges, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign currency transaction gains or losses on a nonderivative hedging instrument in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. Such amounts remain in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the underlying foreign operations occurs for investments in foreign entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We classify cash flows from hedging instruments in the same manner as the respective hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, is expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated. We formally designate and document, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective, the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction and method for assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions, if it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, we would no longer consider the hedge effective and would record all of the derivative gains and losses in the consolidated statement of earnings in the current period.\n\nFor financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments or do not qualify for hedge accounting, we record changes in fair value in the consolidated statement of earnings each period. We do not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.",

          "chunk_text": "## Captive Insurance Companies\n\nIn accordance with local insurance regulations, our consolidated captive insurance companies are required to meet and maintain minimum solvency capital requirements. The Company elected to invest a majority of its solvency capital in a portfolio of marketable equity and debt securities. These securities are included in the disclosures above. The Company uses one of our consolidated captive insurance companies to reinsure group annuity insurance contracts that cover the obligations of certain of our European and Canadian pension plans. This captive's solvency capital funds included total equity and debt securities of $1,883 million and $1,643 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were classified in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets because the assets were not available to satisfy our current obligations.\n\n## NOTE 5: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company's financial performance and are referred to as 'market risks.' When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\n\nThe Company uses various types of derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative returns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect ex pected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes) a call option, or alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-derivative instruments, such as our foreign currency denominated third-party debt, in hedging relationships.\n\nAll derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid ex penses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with the same counterparty.\n\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our consolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the values of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings.\n\nFor derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures.\n\nThe Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to Note 17. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency ex change rates, commodity rates or other financial indices. The Company does not view the fair",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

The sensitivity of our derivatives to these m arket fluctuations is discussed below . See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statem ents for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies.

      "answer": "The corporate income tax rate reduction in the Philippines, enacted in Q1 2021, favorably impacted Altria's (MO) effective tax rate in 2021, contributing to a 0.1 percentage point increase to 21.8%. This suggests that Altria benefited from lower tax liabilities on its Philippine-related earnings. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola (KO) maintained a significant capital investment in the Philippines, with property, plant, and equipment in the country representing 10% of its consolidated PPE net as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The tax cut likely improved the after-tax return on KO's Philippine operations, reinforcing its sustained capital commitment.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Note 18. Contingencies\n\nLegal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and its subsidiaries, including PM USA and USSTC, as well as their respective indemnitees and Altria's investees. Various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings, including product liability, unfair trade practices, antitrust, tax, contraband shipments, patent infringement, employment matters, claims alleging violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ('RICO'), claims for contribution and claims of competitors, shareholders or distributors. Legislative action, such as changes to tort law, also may expand the types of claims and remedies available to plaintiffs.\n\nLitigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. Damages claimed in some tobacco-related and other litigation are or can be significant and, in certain cases, have ranged in the billions of dollars. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. In certain cases, plaintiffs claim that defendants' liability is joint and several. In such cases, Altria or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more co-defendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or jury-allocated share of a judgment. As a result, Altria or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding- or judgment-related amounts. Furthermore, in those cases where plaintiffs are successful, Altria or its subsidiaries also may be required to pay interest and attorneys' fees.\n\nAlthough PM USA has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed, there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases. This risk has been substantially reduced given that 47 states and Puerto Rico limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all. As discussed below, however, tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of Florida's bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well. Such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court. States, including Florida, also may seek to repeal or alter bond cap statutes through legislation. Although Altria cannot predict the outcome of such challenges, it is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria, or one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges.\n\nAltria and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except to the extent discussed elsewhere in this Note 18. Contingencies : (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any. Litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nAltria and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation. Nevertheless, litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain. It is possible that the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria, or one or more of its subsidiaries, could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Altria and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. Each of the companies has defended, and will continue to defend, vigorously against litigation challenges. However, Altria and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of Altria to do so.",

          "chunk_text": "current  and  anticipated  production  requirements.  However,  some  components  and  materials  necessary  for  the  production  of  our  RRPs, including those for the electronic devices, are obtained from single or limited sources, and can be subject to industry-wide shortages and price fluctuations. While we were successful in maintaining adequate supply of such components and materials so far, we may not be able to secure such supply going forward, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; this could negatively impact the commercialization of our RRPs.\n\nIn addition, we are also exposed to a world-wide shortage of semiconductors, which continues to put constraints on our device supplies for RRPs. We believe, however, that the overall impact of this shortage remains manageable, and we have adjusted our device assortments to limit the effect on consumer availability of our RRPs.\n\nWe discuss product warranties in more detail in Item 8, Note 5. Product Warranty . The significance of warranty claims is dependent on a number of factors, including device version mix, product failure rates, logistics and service delivery costs, and warranty policies, and may increase with the number of devices sold.\n\nProduct quality may affect consumer acceptance of our RRPs.\n\nOur near-term planned commercialization efforts for the other PMI-developed RRP platforms are as follows:\n\n- We started commercializing an improved version of our IQOS MESH product in Canada, Corsica, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Ukraine and New Zealand under the IQOS VEEV or VEEV brand names. We currently plan to launch this product in additional markets.\n- With respect to TEEPS , our Platform 2 product, we finalized our improvements to this product and conducted a consumer test in the last quarter of 2021. As a result of the feedback from this consumer test, the design of our current Platform 2 technology has been discontinued. We are assessing alternative designs for this consumer segment.\n- Following the consumer test conducted in 2020, and the results of the product use and adaptation study described above, we are incorporating our learnings into our plans to improve our Platform 3 product.\n- We launched  a  Platform  5  product  in  Sweden  in  January  2022,  that  is  a  reformulated  version  of  the  already  commercialized nicotine pouches bearing the Shiro brand by our newly acquired affiliate AG Snus.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of these commercialization efforts could be delayed.\n\nRRP Regulation and Taxation: RRPs contain nicotine and are not risk-free. As we describe in more detail above, we support science-based regulation and taxation of RRPs, and believe that regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present, are  likely  to  present,  or  have  the  potential  to  present  less  risk  of  harm  to  adult  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continued smoking and should recognize  a  continuum  of  risk  for  tobacco  and  other  nicotine-containing  products.  Regulation,  as  well  as  industry practices, should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form.\n\nSome governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotine-containing products such as our RRPs and communication of truthful and non-misleading information about such products.\n\nThese  regulations  might  foreclose  or  unreasonably  restrict  adult  consumer  access  even  to  products  that  might  be  shown  to  be  a  better consumer  choice  than  continuing  to  smoke.  During  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  some  governments  have  been  and  may  continue  to  be temporarily unable to focus on the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business.\n\nWe oppose blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking. By contrast, we support regulation that sets clear standards for all RRP categories and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke.\n\nIn the United States, an established regulatory framework for assessing 'Modified Risk Tobacco Products' and 'New Tobacco Products' exists  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  FDA.  We  submitted  to  the  FDA  a  Modified  Risk  Tobacco  Product Application  ('MRTPA')  for  our Platform 1 product in December 2016, and a Premarket Tobacco Product Application ('PMTA') for our Platform 1 product in March 2017.",

Through these processes, a manufacturer could receive (i) a 'not substantially equivalent' determination, (ii) a denial of a PMTA or (iii) a marketing order withdrawal by the FDA on one or more products, which would require the removal of the product or products from the market. Such actions could have a material adverse impact on the business and consolidated results of operations of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\nProvisional Products : Most cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by PM USA and USSTC are 'Provisional Products.' Altria's subsidiaries timely submitted SE reports for these Provisional Products. PM USA and USSTC have received SE determinations on certain Provisional Products. Those products that were found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent (certain smokeless tobacco products) had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA's determinations; therefore, those determinations did not impact business results. PM USA and USSTC have other Provisional Products that continue to be subject to the FDA's pre-market review process. In the meantime, they can continue marketing these products unless the FDA determines that a specific Provisional Product is not substantially equivalent.\n\nIn addition, the FDA has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of Provisional Product SE reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further FDA review. PM USA and USSTC have Provisional Products included in this subset of products.\n\nWhile Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies believe their current Provisional Products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, they cannot predict how the FDA will ultimately apply law, regulation and guidance to their various SE reports. Should Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies receive unfavorable determinations on any SE reports currently pending with the FDA, they believe they can replace the vast majority of their respective product volumes with other FDA authorized products or with Grandfathered Products.\n\nNon-Provisional Products : Cigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after March 22, 2011 are 'Non-Provisional Products' and must receive a marketing order from the FDA prior to being offered for sale. Marketing orders for Non-Provisional Products may be obtained by filing an SE report, PMTA or using another pre-market pathway established by the FDA. Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies may not be able to obtain a marketing order for non-provisional products because the FDA may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval.\n\nProducts Regulated in 2016 : Manufacturers of products first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an SE report or PMTA by the filing deadline of September 9, 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market. These products can remain on the market during FDA review through court-allowed, case-by-case discretion, so long as the report or application was timely filed with the FDA. Due to the large number of applications received by September 9, 2020, the FDA did not complete its review of all submitted applications by September 9, 2021, although it represents that it has made decisions on more than 98% of the applications, with most being marketing denial orders and a few marketing granted orders for tobacco flavor e-vapor products. A number of the marketing denial orders are subject to litigation challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers. For those products still under FDA review, it is uncertain when and for how long the FDA may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its case-by-case discretion. For products (new or modified) not on the market as of August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file an SE report or PMTA and receive FDA authorization prior to marketing and selling the product.\n\nHelix submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020. JUUL submitted PMTAs to the FDA for its e-vapor device and the related tobacco and menthol flavors in July 2020. As of February 22, 2022, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or JUUL products. In addition, as of February 22, 2022, Middleton has received market orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn December 2013, Altria's subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with PMI, including an agreement that grants Altria an exclusive right to commercialize certain of PMI's heated tobacco products in the United States, subject to FDA authorization of the applicable products. PMI submitted a PMTA and a MRTP application with the FDA for its electronically heated tobacco products comprising the IQOS Tobacco Heating System . The IQOS devices heat, but do not burn tobacco. In April 2019, the FDA authorized the PMTA for the IQOS Tobacco Heating System and in July 2020, the FDA authorized the marketing of this system as a MRTP with a reduced exposure claim. In December 2020, the FDA authorized the PMTA for IQOS 3, an updated version of the IQOS devices. The MRTP authorization for the original IQOS device currently does not apply to the IQOS 3 device. PMI submitted an MRTP application for the IQOS 3 device in March 2021, which is currently under review by the FDA.\n\nIn September 2021, in connection with a patent dispute, the ITC issued a cease and desist order, effective as of November 29, 2021, banning (i) the importation of the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and infringing components into the United States and (ii) the sale, marketing and distribution of such imported products in the United States.

      "answer": "The IQOS device supply constraint due to the global semiconductor shortage, as reported in PM's 2022 filing, limited IQOS user growth in the second half of 2021 and contributed to the delay in resuming U.S. supply following the ITC import ban. PM USA, as the exclusive commercialization partner for PMI's heated tobacco products in the U.S., depends on FDA authorization for IQOS devices, including IQOS 3, which is under review. The cessation of IQOS device sales in the U.S. after November 29, 2021, due to the ITC cease-and-desist order, further disrupted PM USA\u2019s product portfolio. Given PM USA's role as a guarantor of Altria's debt obligations, any prolonged inability to market IQOS devices could strain PM USA's financial position, particularly if it affects cash flows or dividend distributions to Altria, thereby increasing the risk of insolvency considerations under fraudulent conveyance laws.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PM \u2192 IQOS Devices: PM reported that the global semiconductor shortage constrained IQOS device supply in late 2021, affecting user growth and delaying the return to normal growth until mid-2023.",

        "Hop 3: PM USA \u2190 MO: PM USA guarantees Altria\u2019s debt obligations, and under fraudulent conveyance laws, if PM USA becomes insolvent or lacks sufficient capital due to business disruptions like the IQOS supply constraint, the enforceability of these guarantees could be challenged."

In  the  fourth quarter of 2021, the IQOS device supply situation eased, resulting in an improved IQOS user growth versus the third quarter. We expect an improving IQOS device supply situation, with a gradual return to an unconstrained IQOS user quarterly growth progression. However, we still do not have full visibility over the full year 2022.\n\n## IQOS in the United States\n\nOn November 29, 2021, an importation ban and cease-and-desist orders imposed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") relating  to IQOS Platform  1  products  (including  consumables  and  infringing  components)  went  into  effect.  As  a  result, IQOS is  not currently available for sale in the U.S. We have appealed the patent and statutory issues related to the ITC's Final Determination, and also have contingency plans underway, including domestic production. We hope to be able to resume U.S. supply in the first half of 2023. For more details on the ITC case and related legal matters, please refer to Item 8, Note 17 . Contingencies .\n\nThe ITC decision has no bearing outside the U.S.; competitor lawsuits based on the same patent families have repeatedly and universally failed in European courts and the European Patent Office.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nDuring 2021, PMI acquired the following companies:\n\n- Vectura Group plc, an inhaled therapeutics company based in the United Kingdom;\n- Fertin  Pharma A/S,  a  Danish  company  that  is  a  leading  developer  and  manufacturer  of  innovative  pharmaceutical  and  well-being products based on oral and intra-oral delivery systems;\n- OtiTopic,  Inc.,  a  U.S.  respiratory  drug  development  company  with  a  late-stage  dry  powder  inhalation  aspirin  treatment  for  acute myocardial infarction; and\n- AG Snus Aktieselskab, a Danish company, and its Swedish subsidiary, Tobacco House of Sweden AB, fully owned by AG Snus, which operates in the oral tobacco and modern oral product categories.\n\nFor further details on these acquisitions, see Item 8, Note 6.

Through these processes, a manufacturer could receive (i) a 'not substantially equivalent' determination, (ii) a denial of a PMTA or (iii) a marketing order withdrawal by the FDA on one or more products, which would require the removal of the product or products from the market. Such actions could have a material adverse impact on the business and consolidated results of operations of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\nProvisional Products : Most cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by PM USA and USSTC are 'Provisional Products.' Altria's subsidiaries timely submitted SE reports for these Provisional Products. PM USA and USSTC have received SE determinations on certain Provisional Products. Those products that were found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent (certain smokeless tobacco products) had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA's determinations; therefore, those determinations did not impact business results. PM USA and USSTC have other Provisional Products that continue to be subject to the FDA's pre-market review process. In the meantime, they can continue marketing these products unless the FDA determines that a specific Provisional Product is not substantially equivalent.\n\nIn addition, the FDA has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of Provisional Product SE reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further FDA review. PM USA and USSTC have Provisional Products included in this subset of products.\n\nWhile Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies believe their current Provisional Products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, they cannot predict how the FDA will ultimately apply law, regulation and guidance to their various SE reports. Should Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies receive unfavorable determinations on any SE reports currently pending with the FDA, they believe they can replace the vast majority of their respective product volumes with other FDA authorized products or with Grandfathered Products.\n\nNon-Provisional Products : Cigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after March 22, 2011 are 'Non-Provisional Products' and must receive a marketing order from the FDA prior to being offered for sale. Marketing orders for Non-Provisional Products may be obtained by filing an SE report, PMTA or using another pre-market pathway established by the FDA. Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies may not be able to obtain a marketing order for non-provisional products because the FDA may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval.\n\nProducts Regulated in 2016 : Manufacturers of products first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an SE report or PMTA by the filing deadline of September 9, 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market. These products can remain on the market during FDA review through court-allowed, case-by-case discretion, so long as the report or application was timely filed with the FDA. Due to the large number of applications received by September 9, 2020, the FDA did not complete its review of all submitted applications by September 9, 2021, although it represents that it has made decisions on more than 98% of the applications, with most being marketing denial orders and a few marketing granted orders for tobacco flavor e-vapor products. A number of the marketing denial orders are subject to litigation challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers. For those products still under FDA review, it is uncertain when and for how long the FDA may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its case-by-case discretion. For products (new or modified) not on the market as of August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file an SE report or PMTA and receive FDA authorization prior to marketing and selling the product.\n\nHelix submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020. JUUL submitted PMTAs to the FDA for its e-vapor device and the related tobacco and menthol flavors in July 2020. As of February 22, 2022, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or JUUL products. In addition, as of February 22, 2022, Middleton has received market orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn December 2013, Altria's subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with PMI, including an agreement that grants Altria an exclusive right to commercialize certain of PMI's heated tobacco products in the United States, subject to FDA authorization of the applicable products. PMI submitted a PMTA and a MRTP application with the FDA for its electronically heated tobacco products comprising the IQOS Tobacco Heating System . The IQOS devices heat, but do not burn tobacco. In April 2019, the FDA authorized the PMTA for the IQOS Tobacco Heating System and in July 2020, the FDA authorized the marketing of this system as a MRTP with a reduced exposure claim. In December 2020, the FDA authorized the PMTA for IQOS 3, an updated version of the IQOS devices. The MRTP authorization for the original IQOS device currently does not apply to the IQOS 3 device. PMI submitted an MRTP application for the IQOS 3 device in March 2021, which is currently under review by the FDA.\n\nIn September 2021, in connection with a patent dispute, the ITC issued a cease and desist order, effective as of November 29, 2021, banning (i) the importation of the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and infringing components into the United States and (ii) the sale, marketing and distribution of such imported products in the United States. As a result, PM USA removed the products from the",

(the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

      "question": "How does the treatment of dividend equivalents on RSU awards differ between PM and PEP in terms of payout structure and vesting triggers, given PM's inclusion of dividend equivalents during vesting and PEP's cash payout upon vesting?",
      "answer": "PM includes dividend equivalents on RSU awards that accrue during the vesting period and are paid out as part of the RSU settlement, typically after three years or upon specific events like death, disability, or reaching age 58. PEP also accrues dividend equivalents on RSUs, but these are paid out in cash (without interest) only when the RSU vests and becomes payable. Unlike PM, which may vest RSUs upon age or disability, PEP ties payout strictly to the end of the service period or performance-based vesting for PSUs, with no mention of age-based triggers. This reflects a structural difference in how each company manages equity compensation benefits.",

      "answer": "PM USA guarantees Altria's $1.0 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in November 2023, which means its financial health directly affects the creditworthiness of this debt. PM faces significant Canadian litigation exposure, including a CAD 46 million punitive damages allocation in the L\u00e9tourneau case, which translates to approximately $34 million USD. This liability, although specific to its Canadian operations, could influence PM USA's overall financial stability through intercompany dynamics or potential upstream guarantees. Analysts assessing the credit risk of Altria\u2019s $1.0 billion notes must consider how such litigation liabilities could constrain PM USA's ability to support Altria's debt obligations, especially if additional adverse judgments or settlements emerge over the next 12\u201324 months.",

Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results.

According to the MMM evidence, fixed-income investments include government securities, confirming that government bonds are a component of this asset class. PepsiCo\u2019s U.S. pension plan assets show $2,523 million in government securities as of 2021, representing approximately 16% of its total U.S. plan assets.

          "chunk_text": "## Investment Strategy for U.S. Pension Plans\n\nThe Company utilizes the services of investment managers to actively manage the assets of our U.S. pension plans. We have established asset allocation targets and investment guidelines with each investment manager. Our asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the plans. Selection of the targeted asset allocation for U.S. pension plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes. Our target allocation is a mix of 42 percent equity investments, 30 percent fixed-income investments and 28 percent alternative investments. We believe this target allocation will enable us to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:\n\n- (1) optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk;\n- (2) maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers; and\n- (3) maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class.\n\nThe guidelines that have been established with each investment manager provide parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable. Investment managers agree to obtain written approval for deviations from stated investment style or guidelines. As of December 31, 2021, no investment manager was responsible for more than 8 percent of total U.S. pension plan assets.\n\nOur target allocation of 42 percent equity investments is composed of 60 percent global equities, 16 percent emerging market equities and 24 percent domestic small-cap and mid-cap equities. Optimal returns through our investments in global equities are achieved through security selection as well as country and sector diversification. Investments in our common stock accounted for approximately 5 percent of total global equities and approximately 3 percent of total U.S. pension plan assets. Our investments in global equities are intended to provide diversified exposure to both U.S. and non-U.S. equity markets. Our investments in both emerging market equities and domestic small-cap and mid-cap equities may experience large swings in their market value. Our investments in these asset classes are selected based on capital appreciation potential.\n\nOur target allocation of 30 percent fixed-income investments is composed of 33 percent long-duration bonds and 67 percent with multi-strategy alternative credit managers. Long-duration bonds are intended to provide a stable rate of return through investments in high-quality publicly traded debt securities. Our investments in long-duration bonds are diversified in order to mitigate duration and credit exposure. Multi-strategy alternative credit managers invest in a combination of high-yield bonds, bank loans, structured credit and emerging market debt. These investments are in lower-rated and non-rated debt securities, which generally produce higher returns compared to long-duration bonds and also help to diversify our overall fixed-income portfolio.\n\nOur target allocation for alternative investments is 28 percent. These alternative investments include hedge funds, reinsurance, private equity limited partnerships, leveraged buyout funds, international venture capital partnerships and real estate. The objective of investing in alternative investments is to provide a higher rate of return than that which is typically available from publicly traded equity securities. Alternative investments are inherently illiquid and require a long-term perspective in evaluating investment performance.\n\n## Investment Strategy for Non-U.S. Pension Plans\n\nThe long-term target allocation for 70 percent of our international subsidiaries' pension plan assets, primarily certain of our European and Canadian plans, was 66 percent equity securities, 4 percent fixed-income securities and 30 percent other investments. The actual allocation for the remaining 30 percent of the Company's international subsidiaries' pension plan assets consisted of 44 percent mutual, pooled and commingled funds; 21 percent fixed-income securities; 1 percent equity securities and 34 percent other investments. The investment strategies for our international subsidiaries' pension plans vary greatly, and in some instances are influenced by local law. None of our pension plans outside the United States is individually significant for separate disclosure.",

At CL, there are 37,028,000 shares remaining available compared to 28,011,000 shares already issued, giving a ratio of approximately 1.32:1.

      "question": "How does COST's disclosure of Level 1 financial liabilities relate to MDLZ's use of commodity futures for hedging raw material costs, given that Level 1 liabilities include exchange-traded commodity futures?",
      "answer": "COST disclosed that it held no Level 1 financial liabilities in 2022 or 2021, indicating it did not directly engage in exchange-traded derivatives. Meanwhile, MDLZ actively uses commodity futures as part of its risk management strategy to hedge forecasted purchases of raw materials like cocoa, sugar, and wheat. Since Level 1 financial liabilities include exchange-traded commodity futures, as stated in the evidence, this implies that while MDLZ would report such instruments at Level 1 fair value hierarchy, COST had no such exposure during the reporting periods. This contrast highlights differing approaches to commodity price risk management between the two companies.",

        "Hop 1: COST \u2192 Level 1 Financial Liabilities: COST disclosed holding $0 in Level 1 financial liabilities in both 2022 and 2021, indicating no exposure to exchange-traded derivatives.",

Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our bifurcated exchange options are valued, as derivative instrument liabilities, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related to the market price of the underlying note and associated credit spread combined with the share of price, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility of the JDE Peet's shares over the life of the option. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our derivative contracts do not have a legal right of set-off.

See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our asset derivatives is recorded within other current assets and other assets and the fair value of our liability derivatives is recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Non-cash changes in unrealized gains and losses related to our unsettled derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items, net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated, and those that are economic hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Currency movements related to our non-U.S. debt and our net investments in non-U.S. operations, as well as the related deferred taxes, are recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.\n\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.\n\nCommodity derivatives . We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nCurrency exchange derivatives . We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. In the combustible product category, we predominantly sell American blend cigarette brands, such as Marlboro , L&amp;M , Parliament, Philip Morris and Chesterfield , which are the most popular across many of our markets. In the RRP product category, we predominantly sell Platform 1 devices and heated tobacco units under the IQOS brand  umbrella. We seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories, although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premium-price category.\n\nThe  competitive  environment  and  our  competitive  position  can  be  significantly  influenced  by  weak  economic  conditions,  erosion  of consumer  confidence,  competitors'  introduction  of  lower-price  products  or  innovative  products,  higher  tobacco  product  taxes,  higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products  and  restricts  adult  consumer  access  to  truthful  and  non-misleading  information  about  our  RRPs.  Competitors  in  our  industry include three large international tobacco companies, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and  local  tobacco  companies  and,  in  some  instances,  state-owned  tobacco  enterprises,  principally  in Algeria,  Egypt,  the  PRC,  Taiwan, Thailand  and  Vietnam.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative products  through  inappropriate  marketing  campaigns,  messaging  and  inferior  product  satisfaction,  while  not  relying  on  scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the  dissemination  of  inaccurate  and  misleading  information  about  our  RRPs,  all  of  which  could  have  a  mutual  adverse  effect  on  our profitability and results of operations.\n\n## Procurement and Raw Materials\n\nWe purchase tobacco leaf of various types, grades and styles throughout the world, mostly through independent tobacco suppliers. In 2021, we also contracted directly with farmers in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Pakistan and Poland. In 2021, direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 25% of PMI's global leaf requirements. The largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from Argentina, Brazil, China, Italy, Indonesia (mostly for domestic use in kretek products), Malawi, Mozambique, the Philippines, Turkey and the United States.\n\nWe  believe  that  there  is  an  adequate  supply  of  tobacco  leaf  in  the  world  markets  to  satisfy  our  current  and  anticipated  production requirements.",

Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

      "answer": "MDLZ has long-term financial obligations tied to multiemployer pension plans, with vesting periods governed by union agreements that result in multi-year liabilities such as a $526 million withdrawal liability paid over 19 years. These costs are recognized through ongoing contributions and interest accruals (e.g., $11 million in 2021). In contrast, WMT structures its employee incentives through equity compensation with defined vesting periods\u2014such as restricted stock units that vest 25% annually over four years\u2014with fair value discounted for expected dividends (e.g., 3.8% in fiscal 2022) and expensed ratably over the vesting term. While MDLZ's obligations are shaped by collective bargaining and multiemployer fund rules, WMT's vesting schedules are internally designed to align with shareholder interests and are accounted for as equity or expense over shorter, fixed timeframes.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe Walmart Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the \"Plan\"), as subsequently amended and restated, was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, restricted stock units, performance share units and other equity compensation awards for which 260 million shares of Walmart common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders.\n\nThe Plan's award types are summarized as follows:\n\n- Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period. Beginning in fiscal 2020, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 25% each year over a four year period from the date of the grant. Prior to fiscal 2020, 50% of restricted stock units generally vested three years from the grant date and the remaining 50% were vested five years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period. The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 3.8%, 4.4% and 4.9%, respectively.\n- Restricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment. Performance-based restricted stock units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and generally range from 0% to 150% of the original award amount. Vesting periods for these awards are generally between one and three years. Restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 4.2%, 4.5% and 5.1%, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the Plan, Flipkart has certain share-based compensation plans for associates under which options to acquire Flipkart common shares may be issued. Share-based compensation expense associated with these plans is included in the Other line in the table above.",

      "question": "How does Colgate's 7.0% organic sales growth in Latin America, driven by Argentina, relate to Coca-Cola's reliance on Arca Continental for bottling operations in northern Argentina, given Arca's role in distributing Coca-Cola products in that region?",
      "answer": "Colgate's 7.0% organic sales growth in Latin America was partially driven by performance in Argentina, reflecting strong demand in consumer goods categories like Oral Care and Personal Care. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola relies on Arca Continental, which operates bottling and distribution in northern Argentina, to handle Coca-Cola products in that region. Since Arca Continental serves as a key bottler for Coca-Cola in northern Argentina, and Colgate also sees Argentina as a growth contributor in Latin America, both companies maintain a significant commercial presence in the country\u2014Colgate through direct consumer product sales and Coca-Cola through its bottler Arca Continental. This shared market presence in Argentina highlights the region\u2019s importance to both companies' Latin American strategies, though through different channels\u2014Colgate via retail sales of consumer packaged goods and Coca-Cola via beverage bottling and distribution through Arca.",

Organic sales in Latin America increased 8.0% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in Latin America in 2021 versus 2020 was due to increases in Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the bar soap and underarm protection categories. The increase in Home Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the fabric softener and liquid cleaner categories.\n\nOperating profit in Latin America increased 4% in 2021 to $1,012, while as a percentage of Net sales it decreased 90 bps to 27.6%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to a decrease in Gross profit (150 bps), partially offset by a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses (20 bps) and a decrease in Other (income) expense, net (40 bps), all as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (740 bps), which were partially offset by cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (330 bps) and higher pricing. This decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to decreased advertising investment (70 bps), partially offset by higher overhead expenses (50 bps), primarily driven by higher logistics costs. The decrease in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to a value added tax refund.",

Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

      "answer": "PM allocated goodwill in 2021 to its operations in the Philippines as part of business combinations in several countries, including the Philippines. The Tax Reform Act led to a corporate income tax rate reduction in the Philippines enacted in Q1 2021, which favorably impacted PM's effective tax rate. Meanwhile, KO recorded net tax charges of $375 million related to changes in tax laws in certain foreign jurisdictions, including potential implications from the same Tax Reform Act. Therefore, while PM benefited from the Philippine tax cut as part of its goodwill allocation strategy, KO experienced a negative tax impact from foreign tax law changes, including those potentially influenced by the Tax Reform Act.",

An accounting policy election is available to either account for the tax effects of GILTI in the period that is subject to such taxes or to provide deferred taxes for book and tax basis differences that upon reversal may be subject to such taxes.

Altria notes that Cronos's operations are subject to laws including the Controlled Substances Act, the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act, and other AML laws. A failure by Cronos or Altria to comply with these laws could result in criminal, civil, or tax liability, negatively impact the availability and cost of capital and credit, and cause reputational harm for Altria.

      "answer": "Coca-Cola relies on FEMSA for 17% of its global unit case volume, which includes operations in Nicaragua as part of FEMSA's Latin American footprint. In contrast, Walmart operates in Nicaragua as part of its Mexico and Central America subsidiary, indicating a direct ownership and operational presence in the country. While Coca-Cola's exposure to Nicaragua is indirect through its bottler relationship with FEMSA, Walmart maintains full operational control over its Nicaraguan business as a majority-owned subsidiary, aligning with its broader international retail strategy across 23 countries.",

Total payments, primarily related to marketing, made to equity method investees were $516 million, $547 million and $897 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in net sales to equity method investees in 2021 was primarily due to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, purchases of beverage products from equity method investees were $496 million, $452 million and $426 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in purchases of beverage products in 2021 was primarily due to increased purchases of Monster products as a result of international expansion and category growth.\n\nThe following table presents the difference between calculated fair value, based on quoted closing prices of publicly traded shares, and our Company's carrying value in investments in publicly traded companies accounted for under the equity method (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "represented 17 percent of the Company's worldwide unit case volume. Of the U.S. unit case volume, 61 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 42 percent of U.S. unit case volume. Unit case volume outside the United States represented 83 percent of the Company's worldwide unit case volume in 2021. The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 48 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\n\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.\n\nThe Walmart U.S. business also includes an in-house advertising offering via Walmart Connect, supply chain and fulfillment capabilities to online marketplace sellers via Walmart Fulfillment Services, and access to quality, affordable healthcare via Walmart Health. In Fiscal 2022, Walmart U.S. initiatives also included the launch of a B2B last mile delivery service platform via Walmart GoLocal, and Walmart Luminate which provides a suite of data products to merchants and suppliers. Additional service offerings include fuel, financial services and related products (including through our digital channels, stores and clubs as well as our previously announced fintech joint venture), such as money orders, prepaid access, money transfers, check cashing, bill payment, and certain types of installment lending. Combined, these offerings do not currently represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues.\n\nOperations. Walmart U.S. is available to customers through supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets, as well as online or through the mobile application 24 hours a day. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart U.S. continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help stores operate more efficiently, such as pickup and delivery, Walmart+, shipfrom-store and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences.\n\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.\n\nCompetition. Walmart U.S. competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercentertype stores, eCommerce retailers, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers, and greater brand recognition. They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.\n\nOur ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. We employ many strategies and programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These strategies include the following:\n\n- EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;\n- EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers;\n- Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery and our Walmart+ membership offering, all of which enhance convenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served; and\n- Expanding our flywheel and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital advertising, fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial services.\n\nDistribution. We utilize a total of 157 distribution facilities which are located strategically throughout the U.S. For fiscal 2022, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 31 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as leveraging our ability to ship or deliver directly from more than 3,500 stores.\n\n## Walmart International Segment\n\nWalmart International is our second largest segment and operated in 23 countries outside of the U.S. as of January 31, 2022. Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, and China, and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa (which includes Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), India, as well as Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua).

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\n\nAs we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our ov erall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adv erse effects that the v olatility of these markets may hav e on our operating results.\n\nWe principally utilize deriv ativ e instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from v olatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our deriv ativ e activ ity and the types of deriv ativ e instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 10, Financial Instruments .\n\nMany of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create v olatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the  U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated  reporting  generally  results  in  a  cumulativ e  translation  adjustment  to  other  comprehensiv e  income  within  equity. A  stronger  U.S.  dollar relativ e to other functional currencies adv ersely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate v olatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Operations by Operating Segment under Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results for  currency  exchange  effects  on  our  financial  results.  T hroughout  our  discussion  and  analysis  of  results,  we  isolate  currency  impacts  and supplementally prov ide net rev enues, operating income and diluted earnings per share on a constant currency basis. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, recent currency dev aluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting .\n\nWe also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather  conditions,  gov ernment  policy  and  regulation  and  the  macroeconomic  env ironment.  Refer  to Recent  Developments  and  Significant  Items Affecting Comparability and Financial Outlook above for updates on recent supply chain, labor and other disruptions that are increasing operating costs and  impacting  our  results.  T o  manage  input  cost  v olatility  and  inflation,  we  enter  into  forward  purchase  agreements  and  other  deriv ativ e  financial instruments. We also pursue productiv ity and cost sav ing measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings.\n\nWe regularly ev aluate our v ariable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures  include  mov ements  in  U.S.  T reasury  rates,  corporate  credit  spreads,  commercial  paper  rates  as  well  as  limited  debt  tied  to  Secured Overnight  Financing  Rates  ('SOFR').  We  periodically  use  interest  rate  swaps  and  forward  interest  rate  contracts  to  achiev e  a  desired  proportion  of variable  v ersus  fixed-rate  debt  based  on  current  and  projected  market  conditions.  For  more  information  on  our  debt  activ ity,  see  Note  9, Debt  and Borrowing Arrangements .\n\nSee Note 10, Financial Instruments , for more information on our deriv ativ e activ ity.\n\n## Value at Risk\n\nWe use a value at risk ('VAR') computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair v alue of our interest rate-sensitiv e financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitiv e deriv ativ e financial instruments. T he VAR analysis was done separately as of each quarter end for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios using historical market mov ements. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receiv ables, and net inv estments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the abov e-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.",

This unfavorable impact was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the Argentine peso, Nigerian naira, Zimbabwean dollar, Turkish lira and Japanese yen, which had an unfavorable impact on our Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the British pound and euro, which had a favorable impact on our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Global Ventures operating segments. Refer to the heading 'Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position - Foreign Exchange' below for additional information about the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n'Acquisitions and divestitures' generally refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the Company considers to be structural changes. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in net operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we removed the net operating revenues associated with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. Management believes that quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the Company's net operating revenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their understanding of the Company's net operating revenue performance by improving their ability to compare our year-to-year results. Management considers the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when evaluating the Company's performance. Refer to the heading 'Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands' above for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.\n\nNet operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures. The size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period.

(f)\n\nMerchandise sales - We record almost all retail store rev enues at the point of sale. Digitally originated sales may include shipping rev enue and are recorded upon deliv ery  to  the  guest  or  upon  guest  pickup  at  the  store.  Merchandise  sales  do  not  include  sales  tax  because  we  are  a  pass-through  conduit  for collecting and remitting sales taxes. Generally, guests may return national brand merchandise within 90 days of purchase and owned and exclusiv e brand merchandise  within one  year  of  purchase.  Sales  are  recognized  net  of  expected  returns,  which  we  estimate  using  historical  return  patterns  and  our expectation  of  future  returns.  As  of  February  1,  2025,  and  February  3,  2024,  the  liability  for  estimated  returns  was  $172  million  and  $170  million, respectiv ely.\n\nWe routinely enter into arrangements with v endors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest. Under the v ast majority of these arrangements, which represent less than 5 percent of consolidated sales, we record rev enue and related costs gross. We concluded  that  we  are  the  principal  in  these  transactions  for  a  number  of  reasons,  most  notably  because  we  1)  control  the  ov erall  economics  of  the transactions, including setting the sales price and realizing the majority of cash flows from the sale, 2) control the relationship with the customer, and 3) are responsible for fulfilling the promise to prov ide goods to the customer. Merchandise receiv ed under these arrangements is not included in Inv entory because the purchase and sale of this inv entory are v irtually simultaneous.\n\nRevenue from T arget gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption, which is typically within one year of issuance. Our gift cards do not expire. Based on historical redemption rates, a small and relativ ely stable percentage of gift cards will nev er be redeemed, referred to as \"breakage.\" Estimated breakage rev enue is recognized ov er time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n48",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola sold 33.3 billion unit cases globally in 2023, with 84% of that volume coming from outside the U.S., including significant contributions from China and other APAC markets. Meanwhile, PepsiCo reported that beverages accounted for 23% of its APAC segment revenue in 2023. However, PepsiCo's APAC segment reported $0 in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for 2023, suggesting challenges in profitability despite revenue generation in the region.",

Coca-Cola FEMSA operates in Argentina, specifically in the federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas, according to KO's filing. KO depends on Coca-Cola FEMSA, one of its largest bottlers, for $14.8 billion in annual concentrate sales on average (2019-2021).

Net  sales  could  also  be  adversely  impacted  following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on the consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including     supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. If we  are not successful in  executing  and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our  gross  margin,  operating  margin,  net  earnings  and  cash flows.\n\nForeign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure  to  the  fluctuation  of  exchange  rates.  Translation exposures relate to exchange  rate impacts of  measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a  currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation  of  transaction-related  working  capital  balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In  the  past  three  years,  a  number  of  foreign  currencies  have weakened  versus  the  U.S.  dollar,  leading  to  lower  sales  and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries  that  recently  had  and  are  currently  experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Russia. These fluctuations have significantly  impacted  our  historical  net  sales,  costs  and  net earnings  and  could  do  so  in  the  future.  Increased  pricing  in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  may  offset  portions  of  the  currency  impacts  but  could also  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  consumption  of  our products,  which  would  negatively  affect  our  net  sales,  gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nGovernment Policies. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative,  regulatory  or  enforcement  policies.  For  example, our  net  earnings  and  cash  flows  could  be  affected  by  any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under  the  current  work  being  led  by  the  OECD  for  the  G20 focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the  Economy.\"  The  breadth  of  the  OECD  project  extends beyond pure digital businesses, and if agreed and enacted by most  countries,  is  likely  to  impact  most  large  multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and broadly  establishing  a  15%  minimum  tax  on  their  foreign operations. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and  climate change  matters.  Additionally, we  attempt  to carefully  manage  our  debt,  currency  and  other  exposures  in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and  pricing  controls,  such  as  Nigeria,  Turkey, Argentina  and Egypt. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere.  Changes  in  government  policies  in  these  areas might  cause  an  increase  or  decrease  in  our  net  sales,  gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nCOVID-19  Pandemic. Because  we  sell  products  that  are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nHowever, the continued evolution of the pandemic may result in economic recessions or a slowdown of economic growth in certain countries or regions. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products (due to governmental actions or  key  material,  transportation  and  labor  shortages  impacting our  ability  to  produce  and  ship  products)  or  could  impact consumers'  movements  and  access  to  our  products.  There could also be reduced demand due to consumption decreases and consumer pantry destocking (particularly, in home cleaning,  health  and  hygiene  products)  as  economic  activity resumes  following  slowdowns  or  relaxation  of  governmental restrictions.  Net,  the  uncertainty  in  the  timing  and  extent  of demand  volatility,  the  relaxation  and  reimplementation  of movement  restrictions,  the  timing  and  impact  of  potential consumer pantry destocking, the future economic trends due to a  resurgence  of  positive  cases  and  governmental  actions  in response  to  the  pandemic  may  result  in  heightened  volatility and negative impacts to net sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the pandemic.\n\nWhile we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets due primarily to the restriction of employee movements, key material and labor shortages and transportation constraints. We intend to continue to work with our suppliers and government authorities to implement employee  safety  measures  to  minimize  disruption  to  the manufacturing and distribution of our products. The continued evolution of the pandemic and uncertainty with regards to the disruptions  caused  either  by  resurgence  of  positive  cases  or governmental actions in response to the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain and impact our operations (for example, the closure of a key manufacturing or distribution  facility  or  the  inability  of  a  key  material  or transportation supplier to source and transport materials).\n\nThe pandemic has not had a material negative impact on the Company's liquidity position. We continue to generate operating  cash  flows  to  meet  our  short-term  liquidity  needs and continue to maintain access to capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings.\n\nRussia-Ukraine  War .  The  war  between  Russia  and  Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both countries. Our Ukraine  business  includes  two  manufacturing  sites.  We  have approximately  500  employees  including  both  manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. Our operations in Ukraine accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in fiscal 2022. Additionally, net assets of our Ukraine subsidiary, along",

The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 48 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\n\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V.

Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

      "answer": "PM reported that Turkey's cigarette market grew by 8.2%, primarily due to the easing of pandemic restrictions and increased tourism, but this growth was partially offset by a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade. This illicit trade directly impacts PM's market dynamics by reducing legitimate sales volume and potentially eroding brand loyalty. Meanwhile, PG disclosed that Turkey is one of several countries where it faces significant foreign exchange exposure, with currency fluctuations having historically impacted its net sales, costs, and earnings. Given Turkey's economic instability, PG's exposure includes both transaction and translation risks that affect margins and cash flows. Together, these facts highlight that while PM is grappling with illicit trade undermining its cigarette sales in Turkey, PG is simultaneously facing financial risks from the country's volatile currency, illustrating how different types of market-specific risks\u2014operational and financial\u2014can concurrently challenge multinational corporations in the same geopolitical environment.",

We continue to generate operating  cash  flows  to  meet  our  short-term  liquidity  needs and continue to maintain access to capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings.\n\nRussia-Ukraine  War .  The  war  between  Russia  and  Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both countries. Our Ukraine  business  includes  two  manufacturing  sites.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Discussion and Analysis - Consolidated Operating Results in  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2021.\n\n## Operating Results by Business Segment\n\n## Business Environment\n\n## Taxes, Legislation, Regulation and Other Matters Regarding the Manufacture, Marketing, Sale and Use of Tobacco Products\n\nThe tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash  flows  and  financial  position.  These  challenges,  which  are  discussed  below  and  in  ' Cautionary  Factors  That  May  Affect  Future Results ,' include:\n\n- regulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other nicotinecontaining products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or even ban certain of our products;\n- fiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;\n- illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called 'illicit whites';\n- intense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;\n- pending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies ; and\n- governmental investigations.\n\nRegulatory  Restrictions: The  tobacco  industry  operates  in  a  highly  regulated  environment.  The  well-known  risks  of  smoking  have  led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.\n\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  (the  'FCTC')  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (the  \"WHO\"),  which  entered  into  force  in  2005.  The  FCTC  has  as  its  main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others.  The  FCTC  governing  body,  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  ('CoP'),  has  also  adopted  non-binding  guidelines  and  policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty. In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for  more  scientific  assessment  and  improved  reporting  to  define  policy  on  heated  tobacco  products.  Similar  to  its  previous  policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\n\nPrior to CoP 9 that took place in November 2021, the WHO and the WHO FCTC Secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products. The reports were noted by CoP 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to CoP 10, currently scheduled  for  2023.  It  is  not  possible  to  predict  whether  or  to  what  extent  measures  recommended  by  the  WHO's  reports  will  be implemented as the reports are not binding to the WHO Member States.\n\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today, but how fast, and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that recognize a significant difference on a risk continuum between combustible tobacco on the one hand and non-combustible tobacco and other nicotine-containing products on the other. Regulation should include measures that will accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such products to",

Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

          "chunk_text": "Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our consolidated net operating revenues by 5%. This unfavorable impact was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the Argentine peso, Nigerian naira, Zimbabwean dollar, Turkish lira and Japanese yen, which had an unfavorable impact on our Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the British pound and euro, which had a favorable impact on our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Global Ventures operating segments. Refer to the heading 'Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position - Foreign Exchange' below for additional information about the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n'Acquisitions and divestitures' generally refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the Company considers to be structural changes. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in net operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we removed the net operating revenues associated with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. Management believes that quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the Company's net operating revenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their understanding of the Company's net operating revenue performance by improving their ability to compare our year-to-year results. Management considers the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when evaluating the Company's performance. Refer to the heading 'Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands' above for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.\n\nNet operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures. The size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period. Based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we ex pect foreign currency ex change rate fluctuations will have an unfavorable impact on our full year 2025 net operating revenues.\n\nInformation about our net operating revenues by operating segment and Corporate as a percentage of Company net operating revenues is as follows:\n\n",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\n\nAs we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our ov erall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adv erse effects that the v olatility of these markets may hav e on our operating results.\n\nWe principally utilize deriv ativ e instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from v olatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our deriv ativ e activ ity and the types of deriv ativ e instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 10, Financial Instruments .\n\nMany of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create v olatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the  U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated  reporting  generally  results  in  a  cumulativ e  translation  adjustment  to  other  comprehensiv e  income  within  equity. A  stronger  U.S.  dollar relativ e to other functional currencies adv ersely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate v olatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Operations by Operating Segment under Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results for  currency  exchange  effects  on  our  financial  results.  T hroughout  our  discussion  and  analysis  of  results,  we  isolate  currency  impacts  and supplementally prov ide net rev enues, operating income and diluted earnings per share on a constant currency basis. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, recent currency dev aluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting .\n\nWe also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather  conditions,  gov ernment  policy  and  regulation  and  the  macroeconomic  env ironment.  Refer  to Recent  Developments  and  Significant  Items Affecting Comparability and Financial Outlook above for updates on recent supply chain, labor and other disruptions that are increasing operating costs and  impacting  our  results.  T o  manage  input  cost  v olatility  and  inflation,  we  enter  into  forward  purchase  agreements  and  other  deriv ativ e  financial instruments. We also pursue productiv ity and cost sav ing measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings.\n\nWe regularly ev aluate our v ariable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures  include  mov ements  in  U.S.  T reasury  rates,  corporate  credit  spreads,  commercial  paper  rates  as  well  as  limited  debt  tied  to  Secured Overnight  Financing  Rates  ('SOFR').  We  periodically  use  interest  rate  swaps  and  forward  interest  rate  contracts  to  achiev e  a  desired  proportion  of variable  v ersus  fixed-rate  debt  based  on  current  and  projected  market  conditions.  For  more  information  on  our  debt  activ ity,  see  Note  9, Debt  and Borrowing Arrangements .\n\nSee Note 10, Financial Instruments , for more information on our deriv ativ e activ ity.\n\n## Value at Risk\n\nWe use a value at risk ('VAR') computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair v alue of our interest rate-sensitiv e financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitiv e deriv ativ e financial instruments. T he VAR analysis was done separately as of each quarter end for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios using historical market mov ements. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receiv ables, and net inv estments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the abov e-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP) serves as a key bottler for The Coca-Cola Company (KO) in Sweden, handling the distribution of Coca-Cola trademark beverages under contractual agreements that require CCEP to purchase concentrates from KO. In 2021, KO's five largest bottlers, including CCEP, represented 41% of KO\u2019s total worldwide unit case volume. Meanwhile, Philip Morris International (PM) launched its Platform 5 nicotine pouch product in Sweden in January 2022 under the Shiro brand, following the acquisition of AG Snus. This launch represents a direct market entry strategy by PM, contrasting with CCEP\u2019s role as a contracted third-party distributor for KO, where product supply is dependent on KO\u2019s concentrate pricing and availability. Both companies operate in Sweden, but PM\u2019s strategy involves direct product innovation and brand acquisition, while CCEP relies on KO for product inputs and brand authorization.",

The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 48 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\n\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V.

However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

However,  some  components  and  materials  necessary  for  the  production  of  our  RRPs, including those for the electronic devices, are obtained from single or limited sources, and can be subject to industry-wide shortages and price fluctuations. While we were successful in maintaining adequate supply of such components and materials so far, we may not be able to secure such supply going forward, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; this could negatively impact the commercialization of our RRPs.\n\nIn addition, we are also exposed to a world-wide shortage of semiconductors, which continues to put constraints on our device supplies for RRPs. We believe, however, that the overall impact of this shortage remains manageable, and we have adjusted our device assortments to limit the effect on consumer availability of our RRPs.\n\nWe discuss product warranties in more detail in Item 8, Note 5. Product Warranty . The significance of warranty claims is dependent on a number of factors, including device version mix, product failure rates, logistics and service delivery costs, and warranty policies, and may increase with the number of devices sold.\n\nProduct quality may affect consumer acceptance of our RRPs.\n\nOur near-term planned commercialization efforts for the other PMI-developed RRP platforms are as follows:\n\n- We started commercializing an improved version of our IQOS MESH product in Canada, Corsica, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Ukraine and New Zealand under the IQOS VEEV or VEEV brand names. We currently plan to launch this product in additional markets.\n- With respect to TEEPS , our Platform 2 product, we finalized our improvements to this product and conducted a consumer test in the last quarter of 2021. As a result of the feedback from this consumer test, the design of our current Platform 2 technology has been discontinued. We are assessing alternative designs for this consumer segment.\n- Following the consumer test conducted in 2020, and the results of the product use and adaptation study described above, we are incorporating our learnings into our plans to improve our Platform 3 product.\n- We launched  a  Platform  5  product  in  Sweden  in  January  2022,  that  is  a  reformulated  version  of  the  already  commercialized nicotine pouches bearing the Shiro brand by our newly acquired affiliate AG Snus.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of these commercialization efforts could be delayed.\n\nRRP Regulation and Taxation: RRPs contain nicotine and are not risk-free. As we describe in more detail above, we support science-based regulation and taxation of RRPs, and believe that regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present, are  likely  to  present,  or  have  the  potential  to  present  less  risk  of  harm  to  adult  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continued smoking and should recognize  a  continuum  of  risk  for  tobacco  and  other  nicotine-containing  products.  Regulation,  as  well  as  industry practices, should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form.\n\nSome governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotine-containing products such as our RRPs and communication of truthful and non-misleading information about such products.\n\nThese  regulations  might  foreclose  or  unreasonably  restrict  adult  consumer  access  even  to  products  that  might  be  shown  to  be  a  better consumer  choice  than  continuing  to  smoke.  During  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  some  governments  have  been  and  may  continue  to  be temporarily unable to focus on the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business.\n\nWe oppose blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking. By contrast, we support regulation that sets clear standards for all RRP categories and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke.\n\nIn the United States, an established regulatory framework for assessing 'Modified Risk Tobacco Products' and 'New Tobacco Products' exists  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  FDA.  We  submitted  to  the  FDA  a  Modified  Risk  Tobacco  Product Application  ('MRTPA')  for  our Platform 1 product in December 2016, and a Premarket Tobacco Product Application ('PMTA') for our Platform 1 product in March 2017.",

      "answer": "PepsiCo generates 30% of its regional revenue from beverages in the Africa and Middle East, indicating a significant emphasis on the category within its portfolio. In contrast, Mondelez reports $525 million in beverage revenue for the same region, which is a smaller portion of its total AMEA revenue of $7,296 million. This disparity suggests that PepsiCo may prioritize beverages more strategically in this region compared to Mondelez, which appears to focus more heavily on other categories like biscuits, chocolate, and gum & candy. Additionally, the lack of a detailed beverage breakdown in Mondelez's filings may indicate that beverages are not a core strategic pillar for the company in this region, unlike at PepsiCo where beverages are explicitly highlighted in regional performance metrics.",

      "answer": "The delay in FDA approval of PM's Platform 1 PMTA-submitted product creates regulatory uncertainty that could affect the commercial viability of PM's reduced-risk products in the U.S., similar to the situation with JUUL, whose PMTAs for e-vapor devices were also undecided as of February 2022. This regulatory limbo limits Altria\u2019s ability to confidently project returns on its JUUL investment, which had already been impaired by $2,600 million in 2021 and $8,600 million in 2020 due to declining market valuation and performance of JUUL. The shared risk of PMTA-related regulatory outcomes amplifies Altria\u2019s exposure across both its strategic partnership with PM and its equity stake in JUUL.",

        "Hop 1: PM \u2192 PMTA: PM submitted a PMTA for its Platform 1 product in March 2017, and its regulatory status remains critical to the commercialization of its reduced-risk products in the U.S.",
        "Hop 2: PMTA \u2192 JUUL: JUUL also submitted PMTAs for its e-vapor devices in July 2020, and as of February 22, 2022, the FDA had not issued marketing order decisions, creating parallel regulatory uncertainty.",

          "chunk_text": "current  and  anticipated  production  requirements.  However,  some  components  and  materials  necessary  for  the  production  of  our  RRPs, including those for the electronic devices, are obtained from single or limited sources, and can be subject to industry-wide shortages and price fluctuations. While we were successful in maintaining adequate supply of such components and materials so far, we may not be able to secure such supply going forward, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; this could negatively impact the commercialization of our RRPs.\n\nIn addition, we are also exposed to a world-wide shortage of semiconductors, which continues to put constraints on our device supplies for RRPs. We believe, however, that the overall impact of this shortage remains manageable, and we have adjusted our device assortments to limit the effect on consumer availability of our RRPs.\n\nWe discuss product warranties in more detail in Item 8, Note 5. Product Warranty . The significance of warranty claims is dependent on a number of factors, including device version mix, product failure rates, logistics and service delivery costs, and warranty policies, and may increase with the number of devices sold.\n\nProduct quality may affect consumer acceptance of our RRPs.\n\nOur near-term planned commercialization efforts for the other PMI-developed RRP platforms are as follows:\n\n- We started commercializing an improved version of our IQOS MESH product in Canada, Corsica, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Ukraine and New Zealand under the IQOS VEEV or VEEV brand names. We currently plan to launch this product in additional markets.\n- With respect to TEEPS , our Platform 2 product, we finalized our improvements to this product and conducted a consumer test in the last quarter of 2021. As a result of the feedback from this consumer test, the design of our current Platform 2 technology has been discontinued. We are assessing alternative designs for this consumer segment.\n- Following the consumer test conducted in 2020, and the results of the product use and adaptation study described above, we are incorporating our learnings into our plans to improve our Platform 3 product.\n- We launched  a  Platform  5  product  in  Sweden  in  January  2022,  that  is  a  reformulated  version  of  the  already  commercialized nicotine pouches bearing the Shiro brand by our newly acquired affiliate AG Snus.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of these commercialization efforts could be delayed.\n\nRRP Regulation and Taxation: RRPs contain nicotine and are not risk-free. As we describe in more detail above, we support science-based regulation and taxation of RRPs, and believe that regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present, are  likely  to  present,  or  have  the  potential  to  present  less  risk  of  harm  to  adult  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continued smoking and should recognize  a  continuum  of  risk  for  tobacco  and  other  nicotine-containing  products.  Regulation,  as  well  as  industry practices, should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form.\n\nSome governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotine-containing products such as our RRPs and communication of truthful and non-misleading information about such products.\n\nThese  regulations  might  foreclose  or  unreasonably  restrict  adult  consumer  access  even  to  products  that  might  be  shown  to  be  a  better consumer  choice  than  continuing  to  smoke.  During  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  some  governments  have  been  and  may  continue  to  be temporarily unable to focus on the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business.\n\nWe oppose blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking. By contrast, we support regulation that sets clear standards for all RRP categories and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke.\n\nIn the United States, an established regulatory framework for assessing 'Modified Risk Tobacco Products' and 'New Tobacco Products' exists  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  FDA.  We  submitted  to  the  FDA  a  Modified  Risk  Tobacco  Product Application  ('MRTPA')  for  our Platform 1 product in December 2016, and a Premarket Tobacco Product Application ('PMTA') for our Platform 1 product in March 2017.",

Through these processes, a manufacturer could receive (i) a 'not substantially equivalent' determination, (ii) a denial of a PMTA or (iii) a marketing order withdrawal by the FDA on one or more products, which would require the removal of the product or products from the market. Such actions could have a material adverse impact on the business and consolidated results of operations of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\nProvisional Products : Most cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by PM USA and USSTC are 'Provisional Products.' Altria's subsidiaries timely submitted SE reports for these Provisional Products. PM USA and USSTC have received SE determinations on certain Provisional Products. Those products that were found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent (certain smokeless tobacco products) had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA's determinations; therefore, those determinations did not impact business results. PM USA and USSTC have other Provisional Products that continue to be subject to the FDA's pre-market review process. In the meantime, they can continue marketing these products unless the FDA determines that a specific Provisional Product is not substantially equivalent.\n\nIn addition, the FDA has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of Provisional Product SE reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further FDA review. PM USA and USSTC have Provisional Products included in this subset of products.\n\nWhile Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies believe their current Provisional Products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, they cannot predict how the FDA will ultimately apply law, regulation and guidance to their various SE reports. Should Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies receive unfavorable determinations on any SE reports currently pending with the FDA, they believe they can replace the vast majority of their respective product volumes with other FDA authorized products or with Grandfathered Products.\n\nNon-Provisional Products : Cigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after March 22, 2011 are 'Non-Provisional Products' and must receive a marketing order from the FDA prior to being offered for sale. Marketing orders for Non-Provisional Products may be obtained by filing an SE report, PMTA or using another pre-market pathway established by the FDA. Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies may not be able to obtain a marketing order for non-provisional products because the FDA may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval.\n\nProducts Regulated in 2016 : Manufacturers of products first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an SE report or PMTA by the filing deadline of September 9, 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market. These products can remain on the market during FDA review through court-allowed, case-by-case discretion, so long as the report or application was timely filed with the FDA. Due to the large number of applications received by September 9, 2020, the FDA did not complete its review of all submitted applications by September 9, 2021, although it represents that it has made decisions on more than 98% of the applications, with most being marketing denial orders and a few marketing granted orders for tobacco flavor e-vapor products. A number of the marketing denial orders are subject to litigation challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers. For those products still under FDA review, it is uncertain when and for how long the FDA may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its case-by-case discretion. For products (new or modified) not on the market as of August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file an SE report or PMTA and receive FDA authorization prior to marketing and selling the product.\n\nHelix submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020. JUUL submitted PMTAs to the FDA for its e-vapor device and the related tobacco and menthol flavors in July 2020. As of February 22, 2022, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or JUUL products. In addition, as of February 22, 2022, Middleton has received market orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn December 2013, Altria's subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with PMI, including an agreement that grants Altria an exclusive right to commercialize certain of PMI's heated tobacco products in the United States, subject to FDA authorization of the applicable products. PMI submitted a PMTA and a MRTP application with the FDA for its electronically heated tobacco products comprising the IQOS Tobacco Heating System . The IQOS devices heat, but do not burn tobacco. In April 2019, the FDA authorized the PMTA for the IQOS Tobacco Heating System and in July 2020, the FDA authorized the marketing of this system as a MRTP with a reduced exposure claim. In December 2020, the FDA authorized the PMTA for IQOS 3, an updated version of the IQOS devices. The MRTP authorization for the original IQOS device currently does not apply to the IQOS 3 device. PMI submitted an MRTP application for the IQOS 3 device in March 2021, which is currently under review by the FDA.\n\nIn September 2021, in connection with a patent dispute, the ITC issued a cease and desist order, effective as of November 29, 2021, banning (i) the importation of the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and infringing components into the United States and (ii) the sale, marketing and distribution of such imported products in the United States. As a result, PM USA removed the products from the",

      "answer": "Altria's indemnification agreement with PMI allocates liability for tobacco products based on the manufacturer, meaning PM USA is not liable for liabilities related to IQOS HeatSticks contract manufactured for PMI. PMI submitted a PMTA for the IQOS Tobacco Heating System, which the FDA authorized in April 2019, and for IQOS 3 in December 2020, though the MRTP authorization for the original IQOS device does not apply to IQOS 3. PM submitted an MRTP application for IQOS 3 in March 2021, which is still under FDA review. This regulatory timeline and authorization status directly influence the marketability and associated risks of IQOS HeatSticks, which are contract manufactured by PM USA for PMI, and thus fall under PMI\u2019s liability per the indemnification agreement.",

Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. Other than those amounts, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of any environmental remediation and compliance efforts that subsidiaries of Altria may undertake in the future. In the opinion of management, however, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows.\n\n## Guarantees and Other Similar Matters\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, certain subsidiaries of Altria have agreed to indemnify a limited number of third parties in the event of future litigation. At December 31, 2021, Altria and certain of its subsidiaries (i) had $48 million of unused letters of credit obtained in the ordinary course of business and (ii) were contingently liable for guarantees related to their own performance, including $19 million for surety bonds recorded on its consolidated balance sheet. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries of Altria issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. These items have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on Altria's liquidity.\n\nUnder the terms of a distribution agreement between Altria and PMI (the 'Distribution Agreement'), entered into as a result of Altria's 2008 spin-off of its former subsidiary PMI, liabilities concerning tobacco products will be allocated based in substantial part on the manufacturer. PMI will indemnify Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI. Altria does not have a related liability recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 as the fair value of this indemnification is insignificant. PMI has agreed not to seek indemnification with respect to the IQOS patent litigation discussed above under IQOS Litigation, excluding the patent infringement case filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\nPM USA has issued guarantees relating to Altria's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its $3.0 billion Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program.

Through these processes, a manufacturer could receive (i) a 'not substantially equivalent' determination, (ii) a denial of a PMTA or (iii) a marketing order withdrawal by the FDA on one or more products, which would require the removal of the product or products from the market. Such actions could have a material adverse impact on the business and consolidated results of operations of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\nProvisional Products : Most cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by PM USA and USSTC are 'Provisional Products.' Altria's subsidiaries timely submitted SE reports for these Provisional Products. PM USA and USSTC have received SE determinations on certain Provisional Products. Those products that were found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent (certain smokeless tobacco products) had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA's determinations; therefore, those determinations did not impact business results. PM USA and USSTC have other Provisional Products that continue to be subject to the FDA's pre-market review process. In the meantime, they can continue marketing these products unless the FDA determines that a specific Provisional Product is not substantially equivalent.\n\nIn addition, the FDA has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of Provisional Product SE reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further FDA review. PM USA and USSTC have Provisional Products included in this subset of products.\n\nWhile Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies believe their current Provisional Products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, they cannot predict how the FDA will ultimately apply law, regulation and guidance to their various SE reports. Should Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies receive unfavorable determinations on any SE reports currently pending with the FDA, they believe they can replace the vast majority of their respective product volumes with other FDA authorized products or with Grandfathered Products.\n\nNon-Provisional Products : Cigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after March 22, 2011 are 'Non-Provisional Products' and must receive a marketing order from the FDA prior to being offered for sale. Marketing orders for Non-Provisional Products may be obtained by filing an SE report, PMTA or using another pre-market pathway established by the FDA. Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies may not be able to obtain a marketing order for non-provisional products because the FDA may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval.\n\nProducts Regulated in 2016 : Manufacturers of products first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an SE report or PMTA by the filing deadline of September 9, 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market. These products can remain on the market during FDA review through court-allowed, case-by-case discretion, so long as the report or application was timely filed with the FDA. Due to the large number of applications received by September 9, 2020, the FDA did not complete its review of all submitted applications by September 9, 2021, although it represents that it has made decisions on more than 98% of the applications, with most being marketing denial orders and a few marketing granted orders for tobacco flavor e-vapor products. A number of the marketing denial orders are subject to litigation challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers. For those products still under FDA review, it is uncertain when and for how long the FDA may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its case-by-case discretion. For products (new or modified) not on the market as of August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file an SE report or PMTA and receive FDA authorization prior to marketing and selling the product.\n\nHelix submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020. JUUL submitted PMTAs to the FDA for its e-vapor device and the related tobacco and menthol flavors in July 2020. As of February 22, 2022, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or JUUL products. In addition, as of February 22, 2022, Middleton has received market orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn December 2013, Altria's subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with PMI, including an agreement that grants Altria an exclusive right to commercialize certain of PMI's heated tobacco products in the United States, subject to FDA authorization of the applicable products. PMI submitted a PMTA and a MRTP application with the FDA for its electronically heated tobacco products comprising the IQOS Tobacco Heating System . The IQOS devices heat, but do not burn tobacco. In April 2019, the FDA authorized the PMTA for the IQOS Tobacco Heating System and in July 2020, the FDA authorized the marketing of this system as a MRTP with a reduced exposure claim. In December 2020, the FDA authorized the PMTA for IQOS 3, an updated version of the IQOS devices. The MRTP authorization for the original IQOS device currently does not apply to the IQOS 3 device. PMI submitted an MRTP application for the IQOS 3 device in March 2021, which is currently under review by the FDA.\n\nIn September 2021, in connection with a patent dispute, the ITC issued a cease and desist order, effective as of November 29, 2021, banning (i) the importation of the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and infringing components into the United States and (ii) the sale, marketing and distribution of such imported products in the United States. As a result, PM USA removed the products from the",

          "chunk_text": "current  and  anticipated  production  requirements.  However,  some  components  and  materials  necessary  for  the  production  of  our  RRPs, including those for the electronic devices, are obtained from single or limited sources, and can be subject to industry-wide shortages and price fluctuations. While we were successful in maintaining adequate supply of such components and materials so far, we may not be able to secure such supply going forward, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; this could negatively impact the commercialization of our RRPs.\n\nIn addition, we are also exposed to a world-wide shortage of semiconductors, which continues to put constraints on our device supplies for RRPs. We believe, however, that the overall impact of this shortage remains manageable, and we have adjusted our device assortments to limit the effect on consumer availability of our RRPs.\n\nWe discuss product warranties in more detail in Item 8, Note 5. Product Warranty . The significance of warranty claims is dependent on a number of factors, including device version mix, product failure rates, logistics and service delivery costs, and warranty policies, and may increase with the number of devices sold.\n\nProduct quality may affect consumer acceptance of our RRPs.\n\nOur near-term planned commercialization efforts for the other PMI-developed RRP platforms are as follows:\n\n- We started commercializing an improved version of our IQOS MESH product in Canada, Corsica, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Ukraine and New Zealand under the IQOS VEEV or VEEV brand names. We currently plan to launch this product in additional markets.\n- With respect to TEEPS , our Platform 2 product, we finalized our improvements to this product and conducted a consumer test in the last quarter of 2021. As a result of the feedback from this consumer test, the design of our current Platform 2 technology has been discontinued. We are assessing alternative designs for this consumer segment.\n- Following the consumer test conducted in 2020, and the results of the product use and adaptation study described above, we are incorporating our learnings into our plans to improve our Platform 3 product.\n- We launched  a  Platform  5  product  in  Sweden  in  January  2022,  that  is  a  reformulated  version  of  the  already  commercialized nicotine pouches bearing the Shiro brand by our newly acquired affiliate AG Snus.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of these commercialization efforts could be delayed.\n\nRRP Regulation and Taxation: RRPs contain nicotine and are not risk-free. As we describe in more detail above, we support science-based regulation and taxation of RRPs, and believe that regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present, are  likely  to  present,  or  have  the  potential  to  present  less  risk  of  harm  to  adult  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continued smoking and should recognize  a  continuum  of  risk  for  tobacco  and  other  nicotine-containing  products.  Regulation,  as  well  as  industry practices, should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form.\n\nSome governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotine-containing products such as our RRPs and communication of truthful and non-misleading information about such products.\n\nThese  regulations  might  foreclose  or  unreasonably  restrict  adult  consumer  access  even  to  products  that  might  be  shown  to  be  a  better consumer  choice  than  continuing  to  smoke.  During  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  some  governments  have  been  and  may  continue  to  be temporarily unable to focus on the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business.\n\nWe oppose blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking. By contrast, we support regulation that sets clear standards for all RRP categories and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke.\n\nIn the United States, an established regulatory framework for assessing 'Modified Risk Tobacco Products' and 'New Tobacco Products' exists  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  FDA.  We  submitted  to  the  FDA  a  Modified  Risk  Tobacco  Product Application  ('MRTPA')  for  our Platform 1 product in December 2016, and a Premarket Tobacco Product Application ('PMTA') for our Platform 1 product in March 2017.",

In 2023, Coca-Cola sold 33.3 billion unit cases globally, with 84% coming from outside the U.S., including major contributions from countries like India and Nigeria. PepsiCo, in contrast, reported that in 2023, 29% of its AMESA revenue came from beverages and 71% from convenient foods.

      "answer": "Altria's investment in Cronos is accounted for under the equity method, meaning its financial statements reflect Altria's share of Cronos's earnings or losses. Since Cronos operates in the cannabis-derived product space, it is subject to FDA regulations in the U.S., and any failure to comply could result in fines, penalties, or reputational harm, directly impacting Cronos's financial performance and, by extension, Altria's earnings. Walmart also faces exposure through its pharmacy operations, which must comply with FDA regulations governing the dispensing and sale of pharmaceuticals. Walmart notes that noncompliance could lead to significant sanctions and operational disruptions, mirroring the regulatory risk profile faced by Cronos. Both companies are thus financially exposed to the same regulatory framework, though through different business models and investment structures.",

      "question": "How does the estimated $170 million pretax unrealized gain on derivatives hedging foreign currency sales in MRK's filing compare to the disclosed impact of economic hedges on MDLZ's net earnings, and what does this suggest about their respective approaches to managing foreign exchange risk on financial performance?",
      "answer": "According to MRK's 2022 filing, the company estimated $170 million of pretax unrealized gains on derivatives maturing within 12 months that hedge foreign currency denominated sales over that same period. This unrealized gain is expected to be reclassified from AOCL to Sales, impacting revenue. In contrast, MDLZ's 2022 filing simply discloses that pre-tax gains and losses from economic hedges are recorded directly in net earnings, without specifying an exact figure. This suggests that while MRK explicitly accounts for and discloses the expected future impact of hedging on sales, MDLZ appears to recognize hedging impacts more directly and immediately in earnings, reflecting a potentially more transparent but less smoothed approach to foreign exchange risk management.",

Gains  and  losses  associated  with  qualifying  cash  flow  hedge  contracts  are  deferred  as  components  of  accumulated  other comprehensive  losses  until  the  underlying  hedged  transactions  are  reported  in  PMI's  consolidated  statements  of  earnings.  As  of December 31, 2021, PMI has hedged forecasted transactions for periods not exceeding the next twelve months, with the exception of one derivative  contract  that  expires  in  May  2024.  The  impact  of  these  hedges  is  primarily  included  in  operating  cash  flows  on  PMI's consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Fair Value Hedges\n\nPMI has entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts, designated as fair value hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate U.S. dollar-denominated debt that results from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. For derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized in current earnings. The carrying amount of the debt hedged, which includes the cumulative adjustment for fair value gains/losses, as of December 31, 2021 was $398 million, and is recorded in long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations\n\nPMI designates derivative contracts and certain foreign currency denominated debt instruments as net investment hedges, primarily of its Euro net assets. The amount of pre-tax gain/(loss) related to these debt instruments, that was reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive  losses  within  currency  translation  adjustment,  was  $278  million,  $(465)  million  and  $234  million,  for  the  years  ended December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  The  premiums  paid  for,  and  settlements  of,  net  investment  hedges  are  included  in investing cash flows on PMI's consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Other Derivatives\n\nPMI has entered  into  derivative  contracts  to  hedge  the  foreign  currency  exchange  and  interest  rate  risks  related  to  intercompany  loans between certain subsidiaries, and third-party loans. While effective as economic hedges, no hedge accounting is applied for these contracts; therefore, the gains (losses) relating to these contracts are reported in PMI's consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Qualifying Hedging Activities Reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses\n\nDerivative gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive losses are a result of qualifying hedging activity. Transfers of these gains  or  losses  to  earnings  are  offset  by  the  corresponding  gains  or  losses  on  the  underlying  hedged  item.  Hedging  activity  affected accumulated other comprehensive losses, net of income taxes, as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "PM's shipments in Turkey increased to 55.7 billion units in 2021 from 47.5 billion in 2020, contributing to a rise in its market share from 41.3% to 44.8%. This growth was partly offset by a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade in Turkey, which negatively impacts legitimate sales and tax revenues. Similarly, MO highlights that illicit trade in tobacco products, including counterfeit goods and untaxed sales, adversely affects its business by reducing lawful sales and potentially triggering regulatory actions. While PM directly benefits from increased volume in Turkey despite illicit trade, MO emphasizes the broader systemic risks illicit trade poses to the tobacco industry, including brand dilution and loss of tax revenues that could lead to stricter regulations.",

Excluding  the  unfavorable  impact  of  the  Saudi  Arabia  customs  assessments, unfavorable  currency  and  acquisitions,  net  revenues  increased  by  18.3%,  reflecting:  favorable  volume/mix,  primarily  driven  by  higher cigarette volume (predominantly in PMI Duty Free and Turkey, partly offset by the GCC and North Africa), higher heated tobacco unit volume (mainly in Egypt, Jordan and PMI Duty Free) and favorable cigarette mix (mainly in the GCC, PMI Duty Free and Turkey); and a favorable pricing variance, mainly driven by combustible pricing (primarily in Egypt and Turkey); partially offset by lower fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets, shown in \"Cost/Other\".\n\nOperating  income,  excluding  currency  and  acquisitions,  increased  by  23.8%,  mainly  reflecting:  a  favorable  pricing  variance;  favorable volume/mix, driven by the same factors and geographies as for net revenues noted above; and lower manufacturing costs (primarily related to combustible products); partly offset by the unfavorable impact of the Saudi Arabia customs assessments, as noted above for net revenues; higher marketing, administration and research costs; and lower fees for certain distribution rights, as noted above for net revenues.\n\nMiddle East &amp; Africa - Total Market, PMI Shipment Volume and Market Share Commentaries\n\nThe estimated total market in the Middle East &amp; Africa increased by 2.9% to 560.5 billion units, mainly driven by:\n\n- Algeria, up by 6.2%, primarily reflecting the impact on adult smoker average daily consumption of the easing of pandemic-related measures, partly offset by the impact of price increases;\n- Egypt, up by 8.8%, mainly reflecting a favorable comparison due to pandemic-related supply chain shortages for competitors' products in 2020, as well as the favorable impact of adult smoker in-switching to cigarettes (mainly in the low-tax tier) from other combustible tobacco products;\n- South Africa, up by 13.2%, primarily reflecting a favorable comparison versus the second and third quarters of 2020, in which the total market was impacted by the pandemic-related ban on all tobacco sales from March 27th through August 17th, partly offset by a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade stemming from the ban; and\n- Turkey,  up  by  8.2%,  mainly  reflecting  the  impact  on  adult  smoker  average  daily  consumption  of  the  easing  of  pandemic-related measures,  coupled  with  increased  in-bound  tourism  (particularly  by  Turkish  expatriates),  partially  offset  by  a  higher  estimated prevalence of illicit trade;\n\n## partly offset by\n\n- International Duty Free, down by 10.6%, primarily reflecting the impact of government travel restrictions and reduced passenger traffic since the start of the pandemic in March 2020; and\n- Tunisia, down by 15.6%, mainly reflecting higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade (primarily due to market disruptions impacting product availability and the impact of price increases in July 2021).\n\nOur Regional market share increased by 1.1 points to 23.1%.",

Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our tobacco operating companies' and investees' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes; imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact Altria's consolidated results of operations and cash flows, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL, and the businesses of its tobacco operating companies and investees; or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies communicate with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities, enforce wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products and, when necessary, litigate to protect their trademarks.\n\n## Price, Availability and Quality of Tobacco, Other Raw Materials, Ingredients and Component Parts\n\nShifts in crops (such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns), government restrictions and mandated prices, production control programs, economic trade sanctions, import duties and tariffs, international trade disruptions, inflation, geopolitical instability, climate and environmental changes and disruptions due to man-made or natural disasters may increase the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco or other raw materials or ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our companies' and our investees' products. Any significant change in the price, availability or quality of tobacco, other raw materials, ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our products and those of our investees could restrict our tobacco operating companies' and investees' ability to continue manufacturing and marketing existing products or impact adult consumer product acceptability and adversely affect our tobacco operating companies' and investees' profitability and businesses.\n\nWith respect to tobacco, as with other agricultural commodities, crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. Additionally, the price and availability of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand. Economic conditions, including inflation and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, are unpredictable, which, among other factors, may result in changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production which could negatively impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply. In addition, as consumer demand increases for smoke-free products and decreases for combustible products, the volume of tobacco leaf required for production may decrease. The reduced demand for tobacco leaf may result in the reduced supply and availability of domestic tobacco as growers divert resources to other crops, which could result in increased costs to our tobacco operating companies.\n\nTobacco production in certain countries also is subject to a variety of controls, including government-mandated prices and production control programs.  Moreover, certain types of tobacco are only available in limited geographies, including geographies experiencing political instability or government prohibitions on the import or export of tobacco, and loss of their availability could impair our subsidiaries' ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also may limit access to and increase the cost of raw materials, component parts and personal protective equipment as United States and global suppliers may temporarily shut down facilities or use different production schedules with lower productivity in order to address exposure to the virus or as a result of a government mandate. In addition, (i) current labor market dynamics indicate labor shortages, with employers in a number of industries having difficulty employing workers and (ii) supply chain dynamics reflect failures and delays resulting from various issues including labor shortages, logistical problems and weather-related incidents. These labor shortages and supply failures and delays have led to certain increases in raw material (for example, resins used in our packaging), ingredient and component part prices and may lead to supply chain disruptions; however, to date, the impact on our operating companies and investees has been immaterial. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, labor market dynamics and supply chain disruptions outlined above may continue, which could adversely affect our subsidiaries' and investees' profitability and businesses. Recent economic conditions reflect an increased rate of inflation. To date, higher inflation has not had a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability. Although Altria anticipates inflation will continue at elevated levels in 2022, it is not expected to have a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability.\n\nIn addition, government taxes, restrictions and prohibitions on the sale and use of certain products may limit access to, and increase the costs of, raw materials and component parts and, potentially, impede our ability to sell certain of our products.

          "chunk_text": "and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  our  Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&amp;A is organized in the following sections:\n\n- Overview\n- Summary of 2022 Results\n- Economic Conditions and Uncertainties\n- Results of Operations\n- Segment Results\n- Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity\n- Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates\n- Other Information\n\nThroughout the MD&amp;A  we  refer  to measures used  by management to evaluate  performance,  including  unit  volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per share and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures  that  are  not  defined  under  accounting  principles generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core earnings per share  (Core  EPS),  adjusted  free  cash  flow  and  adjusted  free cash  flow  productivity.  Organic  sales  growth  is  net  sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is  diluted  net  earnings  per  share  from  continuing  operations excluding  certain  items  that  are  not  judged  to  be  part  of  the Company's  sustainable  results  or  trends.  Adjusted  free  cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and transitional tax payments related to the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio  of  adjusted  free  cash  flow  to  net  earnings  excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors  with  additional  information  about  our  underlying results  and  trends  as  well  as  insight  to  some  of  the  metrics used  to  evaluate  management. The  explanation  at  the  end  of the MD&amp;A provides more details on the use and the derivation of  these  measures  as  well  as  reconciliations  to  the  most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\n\nManagement  also  uses certain market share  and  market consumption  estimates  to  evaluate  performance  relative  to competition  despite  some  limitations  on  the  availability  and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&amp;A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brickand-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category.  The Company  measures  quarter  and  fiscal  year-to-date  market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two  months  as  compared  to  the  end  of  the  reporting  period. Management  also  uses  unit  volume  growth  to  evaluate  and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects  year-over-year  changes  in  unit  volume  excluding  the impacts  of acquisitions, divestitures  and  certain  one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nProcter  &amp;  Gamble  is  a  global  leader  in  the  fast-moving  consumer  goods  industry,  focused  on  providing  branded  consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport dutyfree  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies,  electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell  direct  to  individual consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.\n\nOur market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments  in  which  we  sell  our  products,  we  compete  against  other  branded  products,  as  well  as  retailers'  private-label  brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.\n\n## Organizational Structure\n\nOur organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).\n\n## Sector Business Units\n\nThe Company's ten product categories are organized into five SBUs and five reportable segments (under U.S. GAAP): Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric &amp; Home Care; and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. The SBUs are responsible for global brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovation, marketing plans and supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings (referred to as Focus Markets) and are also responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). Throughout the MD&amp;A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble integrates cybersecurity risk reviews into its Third-Party Risk Management Program, requiring third parties that process high-risk business data to complete cybersecurity assessments, sign data processing agreements, and comply with specific security controls. This ensures that third-party vendors are held to a defined security standard to mitigate potential risks. In contrast, Costco maintains a more reactive incident response framework, which includes a Cybersecurity Materiality Committee composed of cross-functional executives from IT, Operations, Finance, and Legal. This committee evaluates the materiality of significant incidents based on qualitative and quantitative factors, indicating a structured escalation and decision-making process post-incident. While P&G emphasizes proactive third-party controls, Costco focuses on coordinated internal response and materiality assessment after incidents occur.",

In addition, cybersecurity risks are integrated into the Company's broader Enterprise Risk Management program and, when identified, are reported to relevant business and governance leaders within the Company for appropriate action.\n\nTo support the ongoing identification and management of cybersecurity issues, the Company provides information security employee training, conducts global and targeted phishing simulation campaigns and conducts tabletop exercises. The Company also deploys a large library of security tools and experts to help prevent, detect, contain, eradicate and recover from potential cybersecurity issues and cyber-attacks. Further, the Company engages third-party consultants and services for cyber intelligence, insights and assessments of its cybersecurity risk posture and governance.\n\nCybersecurity reviews are embedded into the Company's Third-Party Risk Management program. Generally under this program, third parties that process personal data or high-risk business data on behalf of the Company complete privacy and cybersecurity assessments on a risk basis, which may require such third parties to sign data processing agreements, comply with particular security controls or complete an additional security and privacy assessment.\n\nAs a global company, we manage a variety of cybersecurity threats and cannot wholly eliminate the risk of adverse impacts from such incidents. However, as of the date of this  Form 10-K, we have not identified any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of our operations or financial condition. For additional information on the risks from cybersecurity threats that we have faced in the past and expect to continue to face in the future, please refer to the 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors oversees cybersecurity risks consistent with its general risk oversight responsibility. The Audit Committee of the Board has specific responsibility for reviewing the status of the security of the Company's electronic data processing information systems and the general security, including cybersecurity, of the Company's people, assets and information systems. In support of this general oversight, the full Board reviews at least annually the most significant enterprise risks facing the Company, including cybersecurity risks, as identified in the Company's Enterprise Risk Management program. This review, which includes key members of senior management, covers any key risks from information security that have been identified and corresponding action plans. The Audit Committee also receives regular updates from the Company's CIO and CISO about the Company's information security and systems security programs and plans, including emerging trends and progress on overall enterprise cybersecurity programs and priorities. These updates occur at least three times a year, with interim updates as needed.\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for implementing its strategic plans, including identifying, evaluating, managing and mitigating the risks inherent in them, such as cybersecurity risks. Within management, the Company's CISO has specific responsibility for cybersecurity risk management, reporting to the CIO.\n\nThe Company's CISO has over 15 years of experience in cybersecurity, information security and information risk management, including several years each in security  engineering  and  in  operations,  as  well  as  running  incident  response  organizations.  The  CISO's  organization  includes  a  dedicated  team  of  centralized information security experts and a network of security professionals embedded in each business unit and function.\n\nThe CISO also leads the design and development of the Company's cybersecurity program, relying on functional experts within the central Information Security organization as well as on information security experts within each of the Company's Organizational Units. These embedded experts are responsible for the execution of the Company's overall information security strategy and report security risks in their area of responsibility to their Organization Unit leader and to the CISO. Experts within the Company's central Information Security organization help develop the Company's cybersecurity strategies, policies and standards and similarly report security risks within the central enterprise to the CISO.",

TCCORO presents an independent viewpoint on enterprise cybersecurity risk posture, and oversees CISO's cybersecurity risk identification, measurement and enterprise-wide governance of cybersecurity risk.\n\nInternal Audit serves as Citi's third line of defense and provides independent assurance to the Audit Committee of the Board on the effectiveness of controls operated by the first and second lines of defense to manage cybersecurity risk.\n\nCiti recognizes the risks associated with outsourcing services to, sharing data with, and/or technologically interacting with third parties. Citi has built a robust third-party information security risk management program that governs third-party engagements from selection, to the establishment of legal agreements that govern the relationship, to ongoing monitoring through the duration of the relationship. Third-party risk management includes reliance on contractual requirements around data and cybersecurity, vulnerability assessments, third-party information security assessments performed at intervals determined by risk level, governance to manage endof-life and end-of-vendor-support risks, and third-party incident response protocols.\n\n## Management Governance\n\nCiti's Head of Technology and Business Enablement, who reports directly to Citi's CEO, has overall responsibility for Citi's first line of defense cyber and information security and technology programs. Citi's Head of Technology and Business Enablement has over 30 years of experience in the financial services industry. Prior to joining Citi, he was Senior Partner at PriceWaterhouseCoopers where he oversaw the firm's strategy and execution. For additional information, see 'Corporate Information-Executive Officers' below.\n\nCiti's Head of Foundational Services and CISO, who reports directly to Citi's Head of Technology and Business Enablement, has primary responsibility to assess and manage Citi's material risks from cybersecurity threats. Citi's CISO has decades of experience in managing cybersecurity risks from prior roles as Deutsche Bank's Chief Security Officer, the Chief Information Officer for the Central Intelligence Agency and the Chief Information Officer for the U.S. Intelligence Community.

Citi's CTO has served in various technology roles at Citi since 2012, including most recently as Group Head of Engineering and Architecture. Prior to joining Citi, the CTO worked in equity linked technology at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nMultiple management committees and functions also support Citi's cyber and information security management.\n\nThe Chief Information Officer Committee (CIOC), which consists of, among others, the Head of Technology and Business Enablement, Citi's Co-Chief Information Officers (who report to the Head of Technology and Business Enablement), the CISO, and the Head of TCCORO (who reports both to Citi's Head of Operational Risk within the Risk organization and its Head of Global Functions Compliance within the Global Legal and Compliance organization), serves as an escalation forum for items requiring the attention of technology senior management, including approval of policies, and reports items requiring further escalation to the Technology Committee of the Board of Directors, as appropriate.\n\nThe Information Security Risk Operating Committee (ISROC) is chaired by the CISO and comprises senior members of the Chief Information Security Office and representatives from partner organizations. This committee sets the direction and prioritization for the implementation of the cyber and information security program across Citi. The committee reports and escalates to the CIOC, including for intermediary review and approval of policies escalated from the Information Technology Policy Council (see below). Any actions constituting risk exceptions are escalated to the ISRC.\n\nThe Security Architecture Council, which reports to the ISROC, is an oversight and decisionmaking body focused on ensuring that the target level of security architectural maturity is attained. This council is co-chaired by two representatives from the security architecture and cybersecurity services organizations.\n\nCiti's Information Technology Policy Council provides a centralized review to oversee consistency in the formation of information technology policies and standards. This counsel maintains oversight of policy document requirements to ensure that information technology policy documents meet Citi's objectives as established internally and are in line with laws and regulations as identified and communicated by ICRM.\n\nIn addition, Citi regularly engages third parties globally to assess, audit and/or ex ercise Citi's cyber and information security program, which is ISO-27001 certified. ISO-27001 is an international standard for information security management systems. Citi is regulated by bodies across the globe that also regularly ex amine and audit Citi's cyber and information security program against local laws, regulations and industry best practices.",

Our  gov ernance  policies,  including  our  Information Security Policy, outline high-lev el objectiv es designed to meet compliance and regulatory requirements.\n\nWe undertake a bi-annual NIST CSF and CIS 18 Critical Security Controls assessment, conducted by a third-party, to measure our program maturity. We have implemented a variety of technologies, lev eraging third-party security prov iders for some, and engage in multiple activ ities to seek to identify and mitigate v ulnerabilities and risks in systems. T hese include, among other activ ities, scanning for common v ulnerabilities and exposures, penetration tests on internal and external networks, code scans on applications, allowed application listing, configuration management tools, employee awareness and training, and internal and external audits. We also rev iew , with v arious frequencies, on a risk-based priority select third parties with whom we do business, in an effort to reduce the likelihood of security incidents or business interruptions. We maintain cybersecurity insurance that would apply to certain losses arising from significant security incidents.\n\nWe maintain a security operations center, supported by external prov iders and our employees, which prov ides threat detection and incident response capabilities.  We  maintain  cyber  incident  response  plans  and  related  playbooks,  for  execution  by  our  information  security  team,  in  coordination  with stakeholders (including legal counsel). Significant incidents will be escalated to a Cybersecurity Materiality Committee to assess materiality based on qualitativ e and quantitativ e factors.  T he  Committee is composed of a cross-div isional group of executiv es representing the core business functions of Information Technology and Security, Operations, Administration, Finance and Accounting, and Legal.

      "answer": "PepsiCo experienced low-single-digit beverage growth in Taiwan as part of its broader APAC performance, where net revenue increased 34%, driven by acquisitions like Be & Cheery and organic volume growth in markets such as China, Thailand, Australia, Indonesia, and Taiwan. In contrast, Coca-Cola relies on Swire Beverages, which has exclusive bottling and distribution rights in Taiwan as part of its operations covering mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and 13 western U.S. states. Swire Beverages distributes only 'Company Trademark Beverages' under strict bottler's agreements that require them to purchase concentrates exclusively from Coca-Cola, while also limiting Coca-Cola from distributing competing products in the same containers within Swire\u2019s territory. This exclusive arrangement highlights Coca-Cola's structured approach to market penetration in Taiwan, in contrast to PepsiCo's more modest organic growth in the same region.",

However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

      "question": "What percentage of PEP's U.S. plan assets in 2023 were invested in government securities, and how does this compare to COST's investment policy that limits its short-term investments to U.S. government and agency obligations?",
      "answer": "In 2023, PEP's U.S. plan assets included $1,812 million in government securities, which accounted for approximately 16.1% of the total U.S. plan assets of $11,724 million. COST's investment policy restricts its short-term investments to U.S. government and agency obligations, U.S. government and agency money market funds, and insured bank balances, emphasizing capital preservation. This indicates that while both entities prioritize government-backed instruments for capital preservation, PEP allocates a relatively modest portion of its U.S. plan assets to government securities compared to its broader portfolio diversification.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nrequires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. We included expanded footnote disclosures as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2023-07 in Note 17. Segment Reporting . We will include interim disclosure requirements in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements beginning in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n## Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. We record cash equivalents at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.\n- Depreciation, Amortization and Impairment Testing: We record property, plant and equipment at historical costs and depreciate by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate machinery and equipment over periods up to 20 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years. We amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years.\n\nWe review long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If we determine that an impairment ex ists, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. We base impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. We also review the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.\n\nWe conduct a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment as of October 1 of each year, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require us to perform an interim review. We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If necessary, we will perform a single step quantitative impairment test. Additionally, we have the option to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, goodwill is considered impaired. We measure the amount of impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a reporting unit; however, the amount of the impairment loss is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset ex ceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, we consider the intangible asset impaired and reduce the carrying value to fair value in the period identified.\n\n- Derivative Financial Instruments: From time to time, we enter into derivatives to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks, including foreign currency exchange rate risk. We use various types of derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, options and swaps.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities. We designate derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges at the inception of the contracts. For fair value hedges, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative, as well as the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item, in the consolidated statements of earnings each period. For cash flow hedges, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative each period in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) and reclassify changes to the consolidated statements of earnings in the same periods in which operating results are affected by the respective hedged item. For net investment hedges, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign currency transaction gains or losses on a nonderivative hedging instrument in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. Such amounts remain in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the underlying foreign operations occurs for investments in foreign entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We classify cash flows from hedging instruments in the same manner as the respective hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, is expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated. We formally designate and document, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective, the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction and method for assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions, if it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, we would no longer consider the hedge effective and would record all of the derivative gains and losses in the consolidated statement of earnings in the current period.\n\nFor financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments or do not qualify for hedge accounting, we record changes in fair value in the consolidated statement of earnings each period. We do not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 1.\n\n## Background and Basis of Presentation:\n\n## Background\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a holding company incorporated in V irginia, U.S.A. (also referred to herein as the U.S., the United States or the United States of America), whose subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Throughout these financial statements, the term \"PMI\" refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries.\n\nSmoke-Free Business (\"SFB') is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its smoke-free products. SFB also includes wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories, such as lighters and matches.\n\nSmoke-free products (also referred to herein as \"SFPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its products that provide nicotine without combusting tobacco, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral smokeless, and that therefore generate far lower levels of harmful chemicals. As such, these products have the potential to present less risk of harm versus continued smoking.\n\nOn September 17, 2024, PMI announced the execution of a definitive agreement pursuant to which PMI's direct, wholly-owned subsidiary, V ectura Fertin Pharma Inc., agreed to sell  V ectura  G roup  Ltd.  (formerly,  V ectura  G roup  plc,  and  hereinafter  referred  to  as  'V ectura'  or  \"V ectura  G roup\")  to  Molex  Asia  Holdings  Ltd.  The transaction was completed on December 31, 2024. For further details, see Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures.\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of America  (\"U.S.  G AAP\")  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions include, among other things: pension and benefit plan assumptions; useful lives and valuation assumptions of goodwill and other intangible assets; valuation assumptions for nonmarketable equity securities; marketing programs, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include PMI, as well as its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in which PMI exercises significant influence (generally 20%-50% ownership interest) are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at fair value, if it is readily determinable, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Investments without readily determinable fair values, non-marketable equity securities, are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that values the security at cost minus any impairment. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nFollowing the combination and the progress in 2023 toward the integration of the Swedish Match business into PMI's existing regional structure, PMI updated in January  2024  its  segment  reporting  by  including  the  former  Swedish  Match  segment  results  into  the four  ex isting  geographical  segments.  The four  ex isting geographical segments are as follows: Europe Region; South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA\"); East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU &amp; PMI DF\"); and Americas Region. The Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&amp;H\") segment remained unchanged.\n\nCertain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation as a result of the new segment structure discussed above. For further details, see Note 5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net , Note 13. Segment Reporting and Note 20. Restructuring Activities. These reclassifications did not impact PMI's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.",

      "answer": "MDLZ's Argentine operations contributed $401 million in net revenues in 2021 and were subject to significant currency risk due to Argentina's highly inflationary status, resulting in a $13 million remeasurement loss in that year. Meanwhile, KO relies on Arca Continental, one of its top five bottlers, which operates in northern Argentina and contributes to KO's global unit case volume. Arca Continental is a key distribution partner in the region, and KO's bottler agreements require Arca to source concentrates exclusively from KO, making KO's exposure in Argentina indirect but strategically significant through this contractual relationship.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nArgentina. During the second quarter of 2018, primarily based on published estimates that indicated Argentina's threeyear cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%, we concluded that Argentina became a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes. As of July 1, 2018, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our Argentinean subsidiaries and changed their functional currency from the Argentinean peso to the U.S. dollar. On July 1, 2018, both monetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Argentinean pesos were remeasured into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, with remeasurement and other transaction gains and losses recorded in net earnings. As of December 31, 2021, our Argentinean operations had $9 million of Argentinean peso denominated net monetary assets. Our Argentinean operations contributed $401 million, or 1.4% of consolidated net revenues in 2021. We recorded a remeasurement loss of $13 million in 2021, a remeasurement loss of $9 million in 2020 and a remeasurement gain of $4 million in 2019 within selling, general and administrative expenses related to the revaluation of the Argentinean peso denominated net monetary position over these periods.\n\nBrexit . Following the separation of the United Kingdom from the European Union ('Brexit') in 2020, a new trade arrangement was reached between the U.K. and E.U. that began on January 1, 2021. The main trade provisions include the continuation of no tariffs or quotas on trade between the U.K. and E.U. subject to prescribed trade terms, including but not limited to meeting product and labeling standards for both the U.K. and E.U. Cross-border trade between the U.K. and E.U. is also subject to new customs regulations, documentation and reviews. To comply with the new requirements, we increased resources in customer service and logistics, in our factories, and on our customs support teams. We adapted our processes and systems for the new and increased number of customs transactions. We continue to closely monitor and manage our inventory levels of imported raw materials, packaging and finished goods in the U.K. We have made investments in resources, systems and processes to meet the new ongoing requirements and we work to mitigate disruptions to our local supply chain and distribution, including those related to the recent transportation labor shortage in the U.K., to reduce the impact on our input and distribution costs. Despite our efforts to control costs, we have seen inflationary cost pressures rise in our U.K. business this year, as we have also experienced in other markets. If the U.K.'s separation from, or new trade arrangements with, the E.U. negatively impact the U.K. economy or result in disagreements on trade terms, delays affecting our supply chain or distribution, disruptions to sales or collections, or further increases in inflationary cost pressures, the impact to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be material. In 2021, we generated 9.3% of our net revenues in the U.K.\n\nOther Countries . Since we sell our products in over 150 countries and have operations in approximately 80 countries, we monitor economic and currency-related risks and seek to take protective measures in response to these exposures. We continue to monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts to our `business operations, currencies and net monetary exposures. Since the global onset of COVID-19 in early 2020, most countries in which we do business experienced periods of significant economic uncertainty as well as exchange rate volatility. At this time, except for Argentina which is accounted for as a highly inflationary economy, we do not anticipate any other countries in which we operate to be at risk of becoming highly inflationary economies.\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash:\n\nCash and cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. We also had restricted cash within other current assets of $7 million as of December 31, 2021 and $31 million as of December 31, 2020. Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $3,553 million as of December 31, 2021 and $3,650 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Allowances for Credit Losses:\n\nThe allowances for credit losses are recorded against our receivables. They are developed at a country and region level based on historical collection experiences, current economic condition of specific customers and the forecasted economic condition of countries using various factors such as bond default rates and consumption indexes. We write off receivables once it is determined that the receivables are no longer collectible and as allowed by local laws.",

However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets.

A judgment in a two-county trial resulted in a $0.7 billion liability over fifteen years, with additional cases pending. Meanwhile, Altria's investment in Cronos subjects it to regulatory risks under the same Controlled Substances Act, particularly in the U.S., where noncompliance could lead to criminal, civil, or tax liability, negatively affecting Altria's financial position or reputation.

          "chunk_text": "## Governmental Investigations\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters, including tax, customs, antitrust, advertising, and labor practices. We describe certain pending matters in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies .\n\nIn November 2010, a World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") panel issued its decision in a dispute between the Philippines and Thailand, concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\") into Thailand. The decision concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the Thai government and created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports.  Thailand agreed to fully comply with the decision, but the Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision and commenced challenges at the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO Appellate Body is not operational, and the appeals by Thailand are suspended indefinitely. In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues and the countries have since agreed to seek the establishment of a bilateral consultative mechanism, with the goal of reaching a comprehensive settlement of their dispute, consistent with their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreements, as well as the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families in the country. We continue commercial activities in select locations where safety allows, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and supplies the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement. Production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended. On June 20, 2023, we announced the investment of $30 million in a new production facility in the Lviv region, in Western Ukraine. Preparatory work for the facility began in July 2023. The new production facility was completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and local production commenced in April 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our Ukrainian operations had approximately $0.6 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances.\n\nIn Russia, we are continuously assessing the evolving situation in the country. This includes regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. As of December 31, 2024, our Russian operations had approximately $2.7 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $1.0 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles).\n\nAdditionally, we hold a 23% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution B.V ., which was the holding company of JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), pursuant to Dutch law, PMI's distributor in Russia. On July 18, 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Trade filed a petition before the Arbitrazh Court of Moscow seeking the forced localization of JSC TK Megapolis. On December 5, 2024, JSC TK Megapolis registered the transfer of this equity interest to PMI affiliate ZAO Philip Morris Izhora. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. Related Parties - Equity Investments and Other and Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies.\n\nThese developments above have or may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in impairment charges.\n\nFor further details, see Item 1A. Risk Factors , Item 8, Note 4. War in Ukraine and the \"Trade Policy \" section of this Item 7.\n\n## Impact of Inflation on Our Business and Mitigation E fforts\n\nLike many other global companies, we have experienced inflationary pressures in 2022, 2023 and 2024, including: growing pressures on the cost of certain direct materials, wages, energy, transportation, and logistics as well as an increased cost of capital due to interest rate increases driven by the response to increased inflation. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact on cost of sales was approximately $580 million. In 2024, the impact on cost of sales was approximately 30% of the 2023 level, benefiting from lower prices for direct materials and utilities, despite continued pressure on tobacco leaf costs. In 2025, we expect certain inflationary elements such as direct materials and utilities to stabilize, with a moderate overall increase in inflationary pressures driven by tobacco leaf costs.\n\nInflationary impacts driven by higher wages have resulted from merit increases that reflect local inflation as we continuously evaluate our compensation and benefit offerings to be competitive with the current market. Increased transportation costs resulted from increased shipping rates for all modes of transportation (air, ocean and inland) due to ocean and air capacity constraints. Increases in",

          "chunk_text": "We generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as 'structural changes,' which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company's unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's acquisitions and divestitures.\n\n'Acquired brands' refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.\n\n'Licensed brands' refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.\n\nIn January 2023, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Vietnam. The impact of this refranchising has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments. In January, February and December 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in certain territories in India, and in February 2024, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Bangladesh and the Philippines. The impact of each of these refranchisings has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments.\n\nIn May 2023, the Company acquired certain brands in Asia Pacific. The impact of acquiring these brands has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Asia Pacific operating segment.\n\n## Beverage Volume\n\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, 'unit case' means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and 'unit case volume' means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.",

PMI will indemnify Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI. Altria does not have a related liability recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 as the fair value of this indemnification is insignificant. PMI has agreed not to seek indemnification with respect to the IQOS patent litigation discussed above under IQOS Litigation, excluding the patent infringement case filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\nPM USA has issued guarantees relating to Altria's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its $3.0 billion Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program.

Meanwhile, The Coca-Cola Company relies on Coca-Cola FEMSA for distribution in the federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas of Argentina, as stated in KO's bottler agreements. Coca-Cola FEMSA is one of KO's top five independent bottling partners, which collectively accounted for 41% of KO's total worldwide unit case volume in 2021.

Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

      "answer": "Philip Morris's 15.6% shipment decline in Tunisia in 2022, attributed to higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade, directly illustrates the material impact that illicit trade can have on tobacco companies' operational performance in specific markets. This aligns with Altria's explicit risk disclosure that illicit trade in tobacco products can adversely affect businesses, including those of its investees and subsidiaries, by undermining legitimate distribution channels and reducing tax revenues, which may lead to regulatory or legislative actions. Since both companies operate in overlapping tobacco markets and face similar illicit trade dynamics, this suggests that illicit trade is not just a localized issue but a systemic risk affecting major tobacco firms globally, especially in regions like North Africa where enforcement may be weaker or where market disruptions exacerbate the problem.",

Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our tobacco operating companies' and investees' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes; imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact Altria's consolidated results of operations and cash flows, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL, and the businesses of its tobacco operating companies and investees; or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies communicate with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities, enforce wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products and, when necessary, litigate to protect their trademarks.\n\n## Price, Availability and Quality of Tobacco, Other Raw Materials, Ingredients and Component Parts\n\nShifts in crops (such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns), government restrictions and mandated prices, production control programs, economic trade sanctions, import duties and tariffs, international trade disruptions, inflation, geopolitical instability, climate and environmental changes and disruptions due to man-made or natural disasters may increase the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco or other raw materials or ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our companies' and our investees' products. Any significant change in the price, availability or quality of tobacco, other raw materials, ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our products and those of our investees could restrict our tobacco operating companies' and investees' ability to continue manufacturing and marketing existing products or impact adult consumer product acceptability and adversely affect our tobacco operating companies' and investees' profitability and businesses.\n\nWith respect to tobacco, as with other agricultural commodities, crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. Additionally, the price and availability of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand. Economic conditions, including inflation and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, are unpredictable, which, among other factors, may result in changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production which could negatively impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply. In addition, as consumer demand increases for smoke-free products and decreases for combustible products, the volume of tobacco leaf required for production may decrease. The reduced demand for tobacco leaf may result in the reduced supply and availability of domestic tobacco as growers divert resources to other crops, which could result in increased costs to our tobacco operating companies.\n\nTobacco production in certain countries also is subject to a variety of controls, including government-mandated prices and production control programs.  Moreover, certain types of tobacco are only available in limited geographies, including geographies experiencing political instability or government prohibitions on the import or export of tobacco, and loss of their availability could impair our subsidiaries' ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also may limit access to and increase the cost of raw materials, component parts and personal protective equipment as United States and global suppliers may temporarily shut down facilities or use different production schedules with lower productivity in order to address exposure to the virus or as a result of a government mandate. In addition, (i) current labor market dynamics indicate labor shortages, with employers in a number of industries having difficulty employing workers and (ii) supply chain dynamics reflect failures and delays resulting from various issues including labor shortages, logistical problems and weather-related incidents. These labor shortages and supply failures and delays have led to certain increases in raw material (for example, resins used in our packaging), ingredient and component part prices and may lead to supply chain disruptions; however, to date, the impact on our operating companies and investees has been immaterial. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, labor market dynamics and supply chain disruptions outlined above may continue, which could adversely affect our subsidiaries' and investees' profitability and businesses. Recent economic conditions reflect an increased rate of inflation. To date, higher inflation has not had a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability. Although Altria anticipates inflation will continue at elevated levels in 2022, it is not expected to have a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability.\n\nIn addition, government taxes, restrictions and prohibitions on the sale and use of certain products may limit access to, and increase the costs of, raw materials and component parts and, potentially, impede our ability to sell certain of our products.

          "chunk_text": "FDA actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments.\n\nOn  September  29,  2021,  the  International  Trade  Commission  (\"ITC\")  issued  its  Final  Determination  (\"FD\"),  Limited  Exclusion  Order (\"LEO\") and Cease and Desist Order (\"CDO\"). The ITC upheld the finding of infringement in the ID and found a subsequent violation. The ITC issued a LEO prohibiting the importation of infringing tobacco heating articles and components thereof and cease and desist orders against Philip Morris USA, Inc. and Altria Client Services, LLC, which went into effect at the end of the 60-day Presidential review period on November 28, 2021. We have appealed the patent issues. Furthermore, lawsuits based on the same patent families have been repeatedly and universally rejected in European courts and the European Patent Office. The decision has no bearing outside the United States.\n\nUntil  recently,  there  were  no  countries  with  specific  product  standards  for  heat-not-burn  products.  Currently,  national  standards  setting minimum  quality  and  safety  requirements  for  such  products  have  been  adopted  in  several  countries  with  technical  heat-not-burn specifications and/or methods for demonstrating the absence of combustion. They are mandatory in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, the UAE, Uzbekistan and Bahrain, and voluntary in Armenia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Vietnam, the  U.K.  and  Ukraine.  In  Japan,  a  voluntary  standard  sets  minimum  safety  requirements  for  tobacco  heating  devices.  We  expect  other governments to consider similar product standards and encourage making them mandatory.\n\nAll EU member states have transposed the EU Tobacco Products Directive, including the provisions on novel tobacco products, such as heated  tobacco  units,  and  e-cigarettes.  Most  of  the  EU  member  states  require  a  notification  submitted  six  months  before  the  intended placing on the market of such products, while some require pre-market authorizations for the introduction of such products. To date, we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of our Platform 1 product in over 20 member states.\n\nIn addition, in Italy, in April 2018, we submitted an application for HEETS , used with the IQOS device, requesting regulatory recognition of the  reduction  of  toxic  substances  and  potential  risk  reduction  resulting  from  switching  to  this  product  compared  to  continued  cigarette smoking. In January 2019, our application was not granted primarily on the grounds of insufficient data and questions of methodology.  Due to the constraints of the review process, we had been unable to supplement the application with all the data we subsequently filed with the FDA and to address methodological questions during the review. We plan to submit a new application where we will clarify the concerns raised by the decision and further strengthen our application by submitting additional evidence that became available since we submitted our first application, consistent with our FDA filings. We are confident that our evidence supports our application.\n\nOn October 31, 2019, our Australian subsidiary, Philip Morris Limited ('PML'), submitted an application to the Scheduling Committee of the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia ('TGA') seeking to exempt heated tobacco products from being prohibited in Australia. In August 2020, the TGA issued its decision denying the application and stating that it did not present compelling evidence to establish a public health benefit from greater access to nicotine in heated tobacco products.\n\nTo date, several governmental agencies have published their scientific findings that analyze the harm-reduction potential of certain RRPs versus continuing smoking, including:\n\nIn December 2017, at the request of the U.K. Department of Health and Public Health England, the U.K. Committee on Toxicity published its assessment of the risk of heat-not-burn products relative to cigarette smoking. This assessment included analysis of scientific data for two  heat-not-burn  products,  one  of  which  was  our  Platform  1  product.  The  assessment  concluded  that,  while  still  harmful  to  health, compared with the known risks from cigarettes, heat-not-burn products are probably less harmful. Subsequently, in February 2018, Public Health England published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heat-not-burn products may be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than e-cigarettes.\n\nIn May 2018, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment ('BfR') published a study on the Platform 1 aerosol relative to cigarette smoke using the Health Canada Intense Smoking Regimen. BfR found reductions in selected HPHCs in a range of 80-99%. This publication indicates that significant reductions in the levels of selected toxicants are likely to reduce toxicant exposure, which BfR stated might be regarded as a discrete benefit compared to combustible cigarettes.\n\nIn May 2018, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment ('RIVM') published a factsheet on novel tobacco products that heat rather than burn tobacco, focusing on our Platform 1 product. RIVM analyzed the aerosol generated by our Platform 1 product and concluded that the use of this product, while still harmful to health, is probably less harmful than continued smoking.",

While various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation, the Company's computations are based on a variance/co-variance technique, which assesses the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company's debt, interest rate and foreign exchange, and commodities derivatives, and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level.\n\nThe VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.\n\nVAR on a combined basis decreased to $255 million at September 28, 2024 from $284 million at September 30, 2023 due to reduced interest rate volatility.\n\nThe estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):\n\n",

However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets.

However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

These amounts include purchase commitments related to service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced to  third-party  suppliers.  Due  to  the  proprietary  nature  of  many  of  our  materials  and  processes,  certain  supply  contracts  contain  penalty  provisions  for  early termination. We do not expect to incur penalty payments under these provisions that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## Litigation\n\nWe are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nWe are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment  of  prior  manufacturing  and  waste  disposal  practices.  Based  on  currently  available  information,  we  do  not  believe  the  ultimate  resolution  of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## NOTE 14\n\n## SUPPLIER FINANCE PROGRAMS\n\nThe Company has an ongoing program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers consistent with market practices. The Company also supports a Supply  Chain  Finance  program  ('SCF')  with  several  global  financial  institutions.  Under  SCF ,  the  Company  maintains  an  accounts  payable  system  to  facilitate participating suppliers' ability to sell receivables from the Company to a SCF bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their sales of receivables arrangements directly  with  the  respective  SCF  bank.  The  Company  is  not  party  to  those  agreements,  but  the  SCF  banks  allow  the  suppliers  to  utilize  the  Company's creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. Under this model, this arrangement generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier's decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier chooses to participate in SCF, the supplier selects which individual Company invoices to sell to the SCF bank. The Company's obligations to its suppliers, including the amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the supplier's decisions to finance amounts under these arrangements. The Company does not provide any form of guarantee under these financing arrangements. Our payment terms for suppliers under this program generally range from 60  to 180 days. All outstanding  amounts  related  to  suppliers  participating  in  SCF  are  recorded  within Accounts  payable  in  our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets,  and  the  associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The amount due to suppliers participating in SCF and included in Accounts payable was approximately $5.6 billion as of June 30, 2024 and $5.7 billion as of June 30, 2023.\n\n## NOTE 15\n\n## SUBSEQUENT EVENT\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of its business in Argentina. The Company expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately $750 for accumulated foreign currency translation losses in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.\n\nItem 9.

MDLZ similarly observed interest rate, currency exchange, and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for VAR calculations at year-end. However, MDLZ specifically notes that the values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying assets and were valued accordingly, while PM focuses on interrelationships between movements in interest rates and currencies.

      "answer": "In 2022, Pakistan experienced a 17.3% increase in total tobacco market size, partly due to a lower prevalence of illicit trade, which PM attributed to pandemic-related supply disruptions for illicit products. Despite this improvement, PM's shipment volume in South & Southeast Asia decreased by 1.8% to 142.2 billion units, with Pakistan included in a segment that saw a 1.7-point decline in market share. Meanwhile, MO highlighted in its 2022 10-K that illicit trade in tobacco products could negatively affect its investment in JUUL and have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or earnings. Thus, while PM benefited from reduced illicit trade in Pakistan, MO remained exposed to illicit trade risks across its broader portfolio, including JUUL.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ncould adversely affect the value of Altria's investment in JUUL and have a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated financial position or earnings.\n\n## Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products\n\nIllicit trade in tobacco products can have an adverse impact on the businesses of Altria, its tobacco operating companies and investees. Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our tobacco operating companies' and investees' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes; imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact Altria's consolidated results of operations and cash flows, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL, and the businesses of its tobacco operating companies and investees; or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies communicate with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities, enforce wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products and, when necessary, litigate to protect their trademarks.\n\n## Price, Availability and Quality of Tobacco, Other Raw Materials, Ingredients and Component Parts\n\nShifts in crops (such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns), government restrictions and mandated prices, production control programs, economic trade sanctions, import duties and tariffs, international trade disruptions, inflation, geopolitical instability, climate and environmental changes and disruptions due to man-made or natural disasters may increase the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco or other raw materials or ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our companies' and our investees' products. Any significant change in the price, availability or quality of tobacco, other raw materials, ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our products and those of our investees could restrict our tobacco operating companies' and investees' ability to continue manufacturing and marketing existing products or impact adult consumer product acceptability and adversely affect our tobacco operating companies' and investees' profitability and businesses.\n\nWith respect to tobacco, as with other agricultural commodities, crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. Additionally, the price and availability of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand. Economic conditions, including inflation and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, are unpredictable, which, among other factors, may result in changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production which could negatively impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply. In addition, as consumer demand increases for smoke-free products and decreases for combustible products, the volume of tobacco leaf required for production may decrease. The reduced demand for tobacco leaf may result in the reduced supply and availability of domestic tobacco as growers divert resources to other crops, which could result in increased costs to our tobacco operating companies.\n\nTobacco production in certain countries also is subject to a variety of controls, including government-mandated prices and production control programs.  Moreover, certain types of tobacco are only available in limited geographies, including geographies experiencing political instability or government prohibitions on the import or export of tobacco, and loss of their availability could impair our subsidiaries' ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also may limit access to and increase the cost of raw materials, component parts and personal protective equipment as United States and global suppliers may temporarily shut down facilities or use different production schedules with lower productivity in order to address exposure to the virus or as a result of a government mandate. In addition, (i) current labor market dynamics indicate labor shortages, with employers in a number of industries having difficulty employing workers and (ii) supply chain dynamics reflect failures and delays resulting from various issues including labor shortages, logistical problems and weather-related incidents. These labor shortages and supply failures and delays have led to certain increases in raw material (for example, resins used in our packaging), ingredient and component part prices and may lead to supply chain disruptions; however, to date, the impact on our operating companies and investees has been immaterial. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, labor market dynamics and supply chain disruptions outlined above may continue, which could adversely affect our subsidiaries' and investees' profitability and businesses. Recent economic conditions reflect an increased rate of inflation. To date, higher inflation has not had a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability. Although Altria anticipates inflation will continue at elevated levels in 2022, it is not expected to have a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability.\n\nIn addition, government taxes, restrictions and prohibitions on the sale and use of certain products may limit access to, and increase the costs of, raw materials and component parts and, potentially, impede our ability to sell certain of our products.

      "question": "Given Altria's investment in Cronos, a cannabis-derived product company subject to FDA regulations, how does the potential financial risk from regulatory noncompliance compare to Mondelez's exposure under similar FDA food safety standards, particularly in terms of impairment charges or operational disruptions?",
      "answer": "Altria's investment in Cronos introduces regulatory risk tied to cannabis-derived products, including potential criminal, civil, or tax liabilities, capital cost impacts, and reputational harm due to FDA regulations. Altria previously recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge when Cronos's fair value dropped below carrying value. Mondelez, though subject to FDA food safety regulations, faces risks more aligned with labeling, packaging, and marketing restrictions, including front-of-pack requirements and advertising limitations. While both companies are exposed to FDA regulatory enforcement, Altria\u2019s risk is more severe due to the controlled substance status of cannabis, which could lead to operational shutdowns or asset forfeiture, whereas Mondelez\u2019s risks are primarily tied to compliance costs and potential fines. This distinction suggests that Altria\u2019s financial exposure\u2014particularly in impairment charges or divestment likelihood\u2014is significantly higher than Mondelez\u2019s under similar FDA oversight.",

          "chunk_text": "## Investment Strategy for U.S. Pension Plans\n\nThe Company utilizes the services of investment managers to actively manage the assets of our U.S. pension plans. We have established asset allocation targets and investment guidelines with each investment manager. Our asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the plans. Selection of the targeted asset allocation for U.S. pension plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes. Our target allocation is a mix of 42 percent equity investments, 30 percent fixed-income investments and 28 percent alternative investments. We believe this target allocation will enable us to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:\n\n- (1) optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk;\n- (2) maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers; and\n- (3) maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class.\n\nThe guidelines that have been established with each investment manager provide parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable. Investment managers agree to obtain written approval for deviations from stated investment style or guidelines. As of December 31, 2021, no investment manager was responsible for more than 8 percent of total U.S. pension plan assets.\n\nOur target allocation of 42 percent equity investments is composed of 60 percent global equities, 16 percent emerging market equities and 24 percent domestic small-cap and mid-cap equities. Optimal returns through our investments in global equities are achieved through security selection as well as country and sector diversification. Investments in our common stock accounted for approximately 5 percent of total global equities and approximately 3 percent of total U.S. pension plan assets. Our investments in global equities are intended to provide diversified exposure to both U.S. and non-U.S. equity markets. Our investments in both emerging market equities and domestic small-cap and mid-cap equities may experience large swings in their market value. Our investments in these asset classes are selected based on capital appreciation potential.\n\nOur target allocation of 30 percent fixed-income investments is composed of 33 percent long-duration bonds and 67 percent with multi-strategy alternative credit managers. Long-duration bonds are intended to provide a stable rate of return through investments in high-quality publicly traded debt securities. Our investments in long-duration bonds are diversified in order to mitigate duration and credit exposure. Multi-strategy alternative credit managers invest in a combination of high-yield bonds, bank loans, structured credit and emerging market debt. These investments are in lower-rated and non-rated debt securities, which generally produce higher returns compared to long-duration bonds and also help to diversify our overall fixed-income portfolio.\n\nOur target allocation for alternative investments is 28 percent. These alternative investments include hedge funds, reinsurance, private equity limited partnerships, leveraged buyout funds, international venture capital partnerships and real estate. The objective of investing in alternative investments is to provide a higher rate of return than that which is typically available from publicly traded equity securities. Alternative investments are inherently illiquid and require a long-term perspective in evaluating investment performance.\n\n## Investment Strategy for Non-U.S. Pension Plans\n\nThe long-term target allocation for 70 percent of our international subsidiaries' pension plan assets, primarily certain of our European and Canadian plans, was 66 percent equity securities, 4 percent fixed-income securities and 30 percent other investments. The actual allocation for the remaining 30 percent of the Company's international subsidiaries' pension plan assets consisted of 44 percent mutual, pooled and commingled funds; 21 percent fixed-income securities; 1 percent equity securities and 34 percent other investments. The investment strategies for our international subsidiaries' pension plans vary greatly, and in some instances are influenced by local law. None of our pension plans outside the United States is individually significant for separate disclosure.",

CCEP is contractually obligated to purchase concentrates exclusively from Coca-Cola and is authorized to distribute Coca-Cola products within its designated territory, which includes Norway. In contrast, Philip Morris reports having at least a 15% market share in Norway, indicating a significant presence in the tobacco market.

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. In the combustible product category, we predominantly sell American blend cigarette brands, such as Marlboro , L&amp;M , Parliament, Philip Morris and Chesterfield , which are the most popular across many of our markets. In the RRP product category, we predominantly sell Platform 1 devices and heated tobacco units under the IQOS brand  umbrella. We seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories, although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premium-price category.\n\nThe  competitive  environment  and  our  competitive  position  can  be  significantly  influenced  by  weak  economic  conditions,  erosion  of consumer  confidence,  competitors'  introduction  of  lower-price  products  or  innovative  products,  higher  tobacco  product  taxes,  higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products  and  restricts  adult  consumer  access  to  truthful  and  non-misleading  information  about  our  RRPs.  Competitors  in  our  industry include three large international tobacco companies, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and  local  tobacco  companies  and,  in  some  instances,  state-owned  tobacco  enterprises,  principally  in Algeria,  Egypt,  the  PRC,  Taiwan, Thailand  and  Vietnam.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative products  through  inappropriate  marketing  campaigns,  messaging  and  inferior  product  satisfaction,  while  not  relying  on  scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the  dissemination  of  inaccurate  and  misleading  information  about  our  RRPs,  all  of  which  could  have  a  mutual  adverse  effect  on  our profitability and results of operations.\n\n## Procurement and Raw Materials\n\nWe purchase tobacco leaf of various types, grades and styles throughout the world, mostly through independent tobacco suppliers. In 2021, we also contracted directly with farmers in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Pakistan and Poland. In 2021, direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 25% of PMI's global leaf requirements. The largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from Argentina, Brazil, China, Italy, Indonesia (mostly for domestic use in kretek products), Malawi, Mozambique, the Philippines, Turkey and the United States.\n\nWe  believe  that  there  is  an  adequate  supply  of  tobacco  leaf  in  the  world  markets  to  satisfy  our  current  and  anticipated  production requirements.",

      "question": "Given Altria's exposure to illicit trade risks in tobacco markets and Philip Morris's significant operations in Turkey where illicit trade has increased, what could be the potential impact on Altria's investment in JUUL if Turkey's illicit trade trends were to persist across other key markets?",
      "answer": "Altria highlights that illicit trade in tobacco products can negatively affect consumer perceptions, deprive governments of tax revenues, and potentially lead to regulatory actions that could harm its consolidated financial position or earnings, including the valuation of its investment in JUUL. In Turkey, where Philip Morris reported an 8.2% increase in cigarette volume in 2022, the company also noted a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade as a partial offset to growth. Given that Philip Morris shipped 55.7 billion units to Turkey in 2021, up from 47.5 billion in 2020, the persistence of illicit trade in this key market could signal broader issues that may ripple across other markets. If similar illicit trade trends were to emerge in other geographies, Altria's investment in JUUL could face material adverse effects due to regulatory pressures, brand reputation risks, and potential excise tax shifts, as outlined in Altria\u2019s risk factors.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ncould adversely affect the value of Altria's investment in JUUL and have a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated financial position or earnings.\n\n## Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products\n\nIllicit trade in tobacco products can have an adverse impact on the businesses of Altria, its tobacco operating companies and investees. Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our tobacco operating companies' and investees' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes; imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact Altria's consolidated results of operations and cash flows, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL, and the businesses of its tobacco operating companies and investees; or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies communicate with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities, enforce wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products and, when necessary, litigate to protect their trademarks.\n\n## Price, Availability and Quality of Tobacco, Other Raw Materials, Ingredients and Component Parts\n\nShifts in crops (such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns), government restrictions and mandated prices, production control programs, economic trade sanctions, import duties and tariffs, international trade disruptions, inflation, geopolitical instability, climate and environmental changes and disruptions due to man-made or natural disasters may increase the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco or other raw materials or ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our companies' and our investees' products. Any significant change in the price, availability or quality of tobacco, other raw materials, ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our products and those of our investees could restrict our tobacco operating companies' and investees' ability to continue manufacturing and marketing existing products or impact adult consumer product acceptability and adversely affect our tobacco operating companies' and investees' profitability and businesses.\n\nWith respect to tobacco, as with other agricultural commodities, crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. Additionally, the price and availability of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand. Economic conditions, including inflation and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, are unpredictable, which, among other factors, may result in changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production which could negatively impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply. In addition, as consumer demand increases for smoke-free products and decreases for combustible products, the volume of tobacco leaf required for production may decrease. The reduced demand for tobacco leaf may result in the reduced supply and availability of domestic tobacco as growers divert resources to other crops, which could result in increased costs to our tobacco operating companies.\n\nTobacco production in certain countries also is subject to a variety of controls, including government-mandated prices and production control programs.  Moreover, certain types of tobacco are only available in limited geographies, including geographies experiencing political instability or government prohibitions on the import or export of tobacco, and loss of their availability could impair our subsidiaries' ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also may limit access to and increase the cost of raw materials, component parts and personal protective equipment as United States and global suppliers may temporarily shut down facilities or use different production schedules with lower productivity in order to address exposure to the virus or as a result of a government mandate. In addition, (i) current labor market dynamics indicate labor shortages, with employers in a number of industries having difficulty employing workers and (ii) supply chain dynamics reflect failures and delays resulting from various issues including labor shortages, logistical problems and weather-related incidents. These labor shortages and supply failures and delays have led to certain increases in raw material (for example, resins used in our packaging), ingredient and component part prices and may lead to supply chain disruptions; however, to date, the impact on our operating companies and investees has been immaterial. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, labor market dynamics and supply chain disruptions outlined above may continue, which could adversely affect our subsidiaries' and investees' profitability and businesses. Recent economic conditions reflect an increased rate of inflation. To date, higher inflation has not had a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability. Although Altria anticipates inflation will continue at elevated levels in 2022, it is not expected to have a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability.\n\nIn addition, government taxes, restrictions and prohibitions on the sale and use of certain products may limit access to, and increase the costs of, raw materials and component parts and, potentially, impede our ability to sell certain of our products.

      "question": "How does JPMorgan Chase Bank's role as administrative agent in MDLZ's 2022 five-year revolving credit agreement compare with Bank of America's role in TGT's five-year credit agreement, particularly in terms of amendment activity over the same period?",
      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase Bank served as administrative agent for MDLZ's five-year revolving credit agreement dated February 23, 2022, and no amendments to this agreement are specifically mentioned in the evidence. In contrast, Bank of America, as administrative agent for TGT's five-year credit agreement dated October 18, 2021, oversaw two amendments: Amendment No. 1 dated October 25, 2022, and Amendment No. 2 dated September 20, 2023. This indicates that TGT's agreement under Bank of America saw more active amendment activity compared to MDLZ's agreement under JPMorgan during the overlapping period from 2022 to 2023.",

For additional information, see Note 13. Benefit Plans for disclosures related to PMI's pension and other benefits, Note 15. Financial Instruments for disclosures related to derivative financial instruments and Note 20. Deconsolidation of RBH for disclosures related to the deconsolidation of RBH.\n\n## Note 17.\n\n## Contingencies:\n\n## Tobacco-Related Litigation\n\nLegal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us, and/or our subsidiaries, and/or our indemnitees in various jurisdictions. Our indemnitees include distributors, licensees, and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend, as well as to pay costs and some or all of judgments, if any, that may be entered against them. Pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. (\"Altria\") and PMI, PMI will indemnify Altria and Philip Morris USA Inc. (\"PM USA\"), a  U.S.  tobacco  subsidiary  of Altria,  for  tobacco  product  claims  based  in  substantial  part  on  products  manufactured  by  PMI  or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI.\n\nIt  is  possible  that  there  could  be  adverse  developments  in  pending  cases  against  us  and  our  subsidiaries.  An  unfavorable  outcome  or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.\n\nDamages claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in Brazil, Canada and Nigeria, range into the billions  of  U.S.  dollars.  The  variability  in  pleadings  in  multiple  jurisdictions,  together  with  the  actual  experience  of  management  in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. Much of the tobacco-related litigation is in its early stages, and litigation is subject to uncertainty. However, as discussed below, we have to date been largely successful in defending tobacco-related litigation.",

The sensitivity of our derivatives to these m arket fluctuations is discussed below . See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statem ents for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies.

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

          "chunk_text": "## Captive Insurance Companies\n\nIn accordance with local insurance regulations, our consolidated captive insurance companies are required to meet and maintain minimum solvency capital requirements. The Company elected to invest a majority of its solvency capital in a portfolio of marketable equity and debt securities. These securities are included in the disclosures above. The Company uses one of our consolidated captive insurance companies to reinsure group annuity insurance contracts that cover the obligations of certain of our European and Canadian pension plans. This captive's solvency capital funds included total equity and debt securities of $1,883 million and $1,643 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were classified in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets because the assets were not available to satisfy our current obligations.\n\n## NOTE 5: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company's financial performance and are referred to as 'market risks.' When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\n\nThe Company uses various types of derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative returns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect ex pected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes) a call option, or alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-derivative instruments, such as our foreign currency denominated third-party debt, in hedging relationships.\n\nAll derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid ex penses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with the same counterparty.\n\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our consolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the values of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings.\n\nFor derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures.\n\nThe Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to Note 17. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency ex change rates, commodity rates or other financial indices. The Company does not view the fair",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola relies on Arca Continental for beverage distribution in northern Argentina, which accounts for a portion of its 17% worldwide unit case volume through bottling partners. Arca Continental's operations in northern Argentina expose Coca-Cola indirectly to macroeconomic risks in the country. Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble directly cites Argentina as one of the countries with significant exchange rate fluctuations that have historically impacted its financials, noting foreign exchange volatility in Argentina has significantly affected its net sales, costs, and earnings. This creates a shared exposure point where both companies face risks tied to Argentina\u2019s economic environment, with Coca-Cola exposed through its supply chain dependency and P&G through direct market operations.",

In  the  past  three  years,  a  number  of  foreign  currencies  have weakened  versus  the  U.S.  dollar,  leading  to  lower  sales  and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries  that  recently  had  and  are  currently  experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Russia. These fluctuations have significantly  impacted  our  historical  net  sales,  costs  and  net earnings  and  could  do  so  in  the  future.  Increased  pricing  in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  may  offset  portions  of  the  currency  impacts  but  could also  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  consumption  of  our products,  which  would  negatively  affect  our  net  sales,  gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nGovernment Policies. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative,  regulatory  or  enforcement  policies.  For  example, our  net  earnings  and  cash  flows  could  be  affected  by  any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under  the  current  work  being  led  by  the  OECD  for  the  G20 focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the  Economy.\"  The  breadth  of  the  OECD  project  extends beyond pure digital businesses, and if agreed and enacted by most  countries,  is  likely  to  impact  most  large  multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and broadly  establishing  a  15%  minimum  tax  on  their  foreign operations. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and  climate change  matters.  Additionally, we  attempt  to carefully  manage  our  debt,  currency  and  other  exposures  in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and  pricing  controls,  such  as  Nigeria,  Turkey, Argentina  and Egypt. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere.  Changes  in  government  policies  in  these  areas might  cause  an  increase  or  decrease  in  our  net  sales,  gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nCOVID-19  Pandemic. Because  we  sell  products  that  are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nHowever, the continued evolution of the pandemic may result in economic recessions or a slowdown of economic growth in certain countries or regions. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products (due to governmental actions or  key  material,  transportation  and  labor  shortages  impacting our  ability  to  produce  and  ship  products)  or  could  impact consumers'  movements  and  access  to  our  products.  There could also be reduced demand due to consumption decreases and consumer pantry destocking (particularly, in home cleaning,  health  and  hygiene  products)  as  economic  activity resumes  following  slowdowns  or  relaxation  of  governmental restrictions.  Net,  the  uncertainty  in  the  timing  and  extent  of demand  volatility,  the  relaxation  and  reimplementation  of movement  restrictions,  the  timing  and  impact  of  potential consumer pantry destocking, the future economic trends due to a  resurgence  of  positive  cases  and  governmental  actions  in response  to  the  pandemic  may  result  in  heightened  volatility and negative impacts to net sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the pandemic.\n\nWhile we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets due primarily to the restriction of employee movements, key material and labor shortages and transportation constraints. We intend to continue to work with our suppliers and government authorities to implement employee  safety  measures  to  minimize  disruption  to  the manufacturing and distribution of our products. The continued evolution of the pandemic and uncertainty with regards to the disruptions  caused  either  by  resurgence  of  positive  cases  or governmental actions in response to the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain and impact our operations (for example, the closure of a key manufacturing or distribution  facility  or  the  inability  of  a  key  material  or transportation supplier to source and transport materials).\n\nThe pandemic has not had a material negative impact on the Company's liquidity position. We continue to generate operating  cash  flows  to  meet  our  short-term  liquidity  needs and continue to maintain access to capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings.\n\nRussia-Ukraine  War .  The  war  between  Russia  and  Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both countries. Our Ukraine  business  includes  two  manufacturing  sites.  We  have approximately  500  employees  including  both  manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. Our operations in Ukraine accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in fiscal 2022. Additionally, net assets of our Ukraine subsidiary, along",

      "answer": "KO's transfer of $523 million in surplus international pension assets to general assets in 2024 reduced its exposure to limited partnerships, as these assets were previously part of its pension plan investments, which include vehicles like limited partnerships (as seen in NEE's pension strategy). Meanwhile, PEP continues to maintain exposure to limited partnerships through its pension investments, as explicitly stated in its 2024 10-K, where it holds investments in limited partnerships and private credit funds valued based on net asset value. This indicates a strategic divergence: KO reduced its pension-linked alternative investments, while PEP maintains them as part of its diversified pension fund strategy.",

          "chunk_text": "Intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the discount rates. If the discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions, if applicable.\n\nIn November 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in, and now owns 100% of BA Sports Nutrition, LLC ('BodyArmor'), which offers a line of sports performance and hydration beverages. During 2021, in conjunction with acquiring the remaining ownership interest, we recognized a noncash gain of $834 million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in BodyArmor to fair value. The Company allocated $4.2 billion of the $5.6 billion purchase price to the BodyArmor trademark. During the three months ended March 29, 2024, the operating results related to the trademark were lower than expected. Therefore, the Company revised its projections of the future operating results related to the trademark, which triggered the need to update its impairment analysis. As a result, the Company concluded that the fair value of the trademark was less than its carrying value and recorded an impairment charge of $760 million. The decrease in fair value was primarily driven by the revised projections of future operating results as well as higher discount rates resulting from changes in macroeconomic conditions since the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of this trademark approximates its carrying value. If the near-term operating results of this trademark do not achieve our revised financial projections, or if the macroeconomic conditions change, causing the discount rate to increase without an offsetting increase in the operating results, it is likely that we would be required to recognize an additional impairment charge. Management will continue to monitor the fair value of this trademark in future periods.\n\n## Pension Plan Valuations\n\nOur Company sponsors a qualified pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees as well as unfunded nonqualified pension plans for certain employees in the United States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans outside the United States.\n\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to the actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income. We believe the two most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, or more frequently to the extent that a settlement or curtailment occurs. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income.\n\nThe discount rate assumption used to account for pension plans reflects the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, are applied to projected benefit cash flows to determine the appropriate effective discount rate. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the respective countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost or income by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our ex pected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our investment objective for our pension assets is to ensure all funded pension plans have sufficient assets to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to seek to improve returns and manage risk.\n\nIn 2024, the Company's total net periodic pension cost was $45 million. In 2025, we expect our net periodic pension cost to be approximately $81 million. The increase in net periodic pension cost is primarily due to a lower ex pected return on assets resulting from a transfer of $523 million of surplus international plan assets from pension trusts to general assets of the Company in 2024.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the U.S. qualified pension plan represented 64% and 58% of the Company's consolidated projected benefit obligation and pension plan assets, respectively. For this plan, we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate would result in a $7 million increase in our 2025 net periodic pension cost, and we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in an $18 million increase in our 2025 net periodic pension cost.\n\nRefer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions.",

Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

This  includes  administering  a comprehensive occupational injury- and illness-prevention program and training for team members.\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we have continued to invest in the well-being, health, and safety of our team members and guests. We extended certain benefits to our team members in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, including bonuses, fully-paid  leaves  for  up  to  30  days,  free  back-up  dependent  care,  and  a  variety  of  mental,  emotional,  and  physical  wellness resources. We also enacted dozens of safety, social distancing, and cleaning measures designed to protect our team and guests during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Working Capital\n\nEffective inventory management is key to our ongoing success, and we use various techniques including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. We achieve effective inventory management by staying in-stock in core product offerings, maintaining positive vendor relationships, and carefully planning inventory levels for seasonal and apparel items to minimize markdowns.\n\nThe Liquidity and Capital Resources section in MD&amp;A provides additional details.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete with traditional and internet retailers, including department stores, off-price general merchandise retailers, wholesale clubs, category-specific retailers, drug stores, supermarkets, direct-to-consumer brands, and other forms of retail commerce. Our ability  to  positively  differentiate  ourselves  from  other  retailers  and  provide  compelling  value  to  our  guests  largely  determines  our competitive position within the retail industry.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOur brand image is a critical element of our business strategy. Our principal trademarks, including Target, our \"Expect More. Pay Less.\" brand promise, and our \"Bullseye Design,\" have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We also seek to obtain and preserve intellectual property protection for our brands.\n\n## Geographic Information\n\nNearly all of our revenues are generated within the U.S. The vast majority of our property and equipment is located within the U.S.\n\n## Available Information\n\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and amendments to  those  reports  filed  or  furnished  pursuant  to  Section  13(a)  or  15(d)  of  the  Exchange  Act  are  available  free  of  charge  at investors.target.com  as  soon  as  reasonably  practicable  after  we  file  such  material  with,  or  furnish  it  to,  the  U.S.  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (SEC).

      "answer": "KO uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards, which are expensed on a straight-line basis over a typical four-year vesting period. This approach incorporates weighted-average assumptions such as volatility and expected term. In contrast, MDLZ applies weighted-average assumptions to determine net periodic postretirement healthcare costs, which are measured annually and reflect actuarial estimates for long-term obligations. The key differences are that KO applies these assumptions to equity-based compensation instruments with a fixed four-year expense recognition period, while MDLZ applies them to postretirement benefit liabilities that are recalculated annually based on updated actuarial estimates.",

        "Hop 1: KO \u2192 Black-Scholes-Merton Model: KO uses this model to estimate the fair value of stock options, which are expensed over a four-year vesting period",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive operates manufacturing and warehousing facilities in Poland as part of its global supply chain, indicating a strategic investment in local production capabilities within Eastern Europe. Coca-Cola HBC, in which The Coca-Cola Company holds a strategic stake, manages distribution operations across Poland as part of its broader regional bottling network. While Colgate's presence emphasizes localized manufacturing for its Oral, Personal, and Home Care products, Coca-Cola HBC's role centers on distributing Coca-Cola trademark beverages under contractual agreements. The Coca-Cola Company's stake in Coca-Cola HBC enables coordinated market access and pricing strategies, while Colgate's localized facilities suggest a focus on cost-efficient production and regional supply chain resilience. This contrast reflects differing strategic priorities: Colgate emphasizes asset control in production, whereas Coca-Cola HBC leverages a bottler-partner model focused on distribution efficiency.",

However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets.

      "answer": "Coca-Cola FEMSA operates in Argentina, specifically in the federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas, and its performance is subject to economic conditions in the country, including foreign exchange fluctuations. KO depends on Coca-Cola FEMSA for a portion of its global unit case volume, which totaled 41% combined among KO's top bottlers in 2021. As a result, KO's financial position could be indirectly impacted by Coca-Cola FEMSA's challenges in Argentina due to reduced unit case volume or lower sales. Similarly, PG explicitly states that Argentina is one of the countries where it experiences significant foreign exchange fluctuations, which have historically impacted its net sales, costs, and earnings. PG notes that foreign exchange exposure affects both translation and transaction aspects of its financials, and its mitigation strategies, such as pricing adjustments, may not fully offset the impacts. While KO does not have direct operations in Argentina, its reliance on Coca-Cola FEMSA ties it to the same economic risks that PG faces directly, albeit through different financial mechanisms and levels of control.",

('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

          "chunk_text": "consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our  gross  margin,  operating  margin,  net  earnings  and  cash flows.  Net  sales  could  also  be  adversely  impacted  following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on the consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including     supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. If we  are not successful in  executing  and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our  gross  margin,  operating  margin,  net  earnings  and  cash flows.\n\nForeign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure  to  the  fluctuation  of  exchange  rates.  Translation exposures relate to exchange  rate impacts of  measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a  currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation  of  transaction-related  working  capital  balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In  the  past  three  years,  a  number  of  foreign  currencies  have weakened  versus  the  U.S.  dollar,  leading  to  lower  sales  and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries  that  recently  had  and  are  currently  experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Russia. These fluctuations have significantly  impacted  our  historical  net  sales,  costs  and  net earnings  and  could  do  so  in  the  future.  Increased  pricing  in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  may  offset  portions  of  the  currency  impacts  but  could also  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  consumption  of  our products,  which  would  negatively  affect  our  net  sales,  gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nGovernment Policies. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative,  regulatory  or  enforcement  policies.  For  example, our  net  earnings  and  cash  flows  could  be  affected  by  any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under  the  current  work  being  led  by  the  OECD  for  the  G20 focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the  Economy.\"  The  breadth  of  the  OECD  project  extends beyond pure digital businesses, and if agreed and enacted by most  countries,  is  likely  to  impact  most  large  multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and broadly  establishing  a  15%  minimum  tax  on  their  foreign operations. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and  climate change  matters.  Additionally, we  attempt  to carefully  manage  our  debt,  currency  and  other  exposures  in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and  pricing  controls,  such  as  Nigeria,  Turkey, Argentina  and Egypt. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere.  Changes  in  government  policies  in  these  areas might  cause  an  increase  or  decrease  in  our  net  sales,  gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nCOVID-19  Pandemic. Because  we  sell  products  that  are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nHowever, the continued evolution of the pandemic may result in economic recessions or a slowdown of economic growth in certain countries or regions. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products (due to governmental actions or  key  material,  transportation  and  labor  shortages  impacting our  ability  to  produce  and  ship  products)  or  could  impact consumers'  movements  and  access  to  our  products.  There could also be reduced demand due to consumption decreases and consumer pantry destocking (particularly, in home cleaning,  health  and  hygiene  products)  as  economic  activity resumes  following  slowdowns  or  relaxation  of  governmental restrictions.  Net,  the  uncertainty  in  the  timing  and  extent  of demand  volatility,  the  relaxation  and  reimplementation  of movement  restrictions,  the  timing  and  impact  of  potential consumer pantry destocking, the future economic trends due to a  resurgence  of  positive  cases  and  governmental  actions  in response  to  the  pandemic  may  result  in  heightened  volatility and negative impacts to net sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the pandemic.\n\nWhile we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets due primarily to the restriction of employee movements, key material and labor shortages and transportation constraints. We intend to continue to work with our suppliers and government authorities to implement employee  safety  measures  to  minimize  disruption  to  the manufacturing and distribution of our products. The continued evolution of the pandemic and uncertainty with regards to the disruptions  caused  either  by  resurgence  of  positive  cases  or governmental actions in response to the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain and impact our operations (for example, the closure of a key manufacturing or distribution  facility  or  the  inability  of  a  key  material  or transportation supplier to source and transport materials).\n\nThe pandemic has not had a material negative impact on the Company's liquidity position. We continue to generate operating  cash  flows  to  meet  our  short-term  liquidity  needs and continue to maintain access to capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings.\n\nRussia-Ukraine  War .  The  war  between  Russia  and  Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both countries. Our Ukraine  business  includes  two  manufacturing  sites.  We  have approximately  500  employees  including  both  manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. Our operations in Ukraine accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in fiscal 2022. Additionally, net assets of our Ukraine subsidiary, along",

The MD&amp;A is organized in the following sections:\n\n- Overview\n- Summary of 2022 Results\n- Economic Conditions and Uncertainties\n- Results of Operations\n- Segment Results\n- Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity\n- Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates\n- Other Information\n\nThroughout the MD&amp;A  we  refer  to measures used  by management to evaluate  performance,  including  unit  volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per share and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures  that  are  not  defined  under  accounting  principles generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core earnings per share  (Core  EPS),  adjusted  free  cash  flow  and  adjusted  free cash  flow  productivity.  Organic  sales  growth  is  net  sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is  diluted  net  earnings  per  share  from  continuing  operations excluding  certain  items  that  are  not  judged  to  be  part  of  the Company's  sustainable  results  or  trends.  Adjusted  free  cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and transitional tax payments related to the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio  of  adjusted  free  cash  flow  to  net  earnings  excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors  with  additional  information  about  our  underlying results  and  trends  as  well  as  insight  to  some  of  the  metrics used  to  evaluate  management. The  explanation  at  the  end  of the MD&amp;A provides more details on the use and the derivation of  these  measures  as  well  as  reconciliations  to  the  most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\n\nManagement  also  uses certain market share  and  market consumption  estimates  to  evaluate  performance  relative  to competition  despite  some  limitations  on  the  availability  and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&amp;A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brickand-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category.  The Company  measures  quarter  and  fiscal  year-to-date  market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two  months  as  compared  to  the  end  of  the  reporting  period. Management  also  uses  unit  volume  growth  to  evaluate  and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects  year-over-year  changes  in  unit  volume  excluding  the impacts  of acquisitions, divestitures  and  certain  one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nProcter  &amp;  Gamble  is  a  global  leader  in  the  fast-moving  consumer  goods  industry,  focused  on  providing  branded  consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport dutyfree  stores),  high-frequency  stores,  pharmacies,  electronics  stores  and  professional  channels.  We  also  sell  direct  to  individual consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.\n\nOur market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments  in  which  we  sell  our  products,  we  compete  against  other  branded  products,  as  well  as  retailers'  private-label  brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.\n\n## Organizational Structure\n\nOur organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).\n\n## Sector Business Units\n\nThe Company's ten product categories are organized into five SBUs and five reportable segments (under U.S. GAAP): Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric &amp; Home Care; and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. The SBUs are responsible for global brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovation, marketing plans and supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings (referred to as Focus Markets) and are also responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). Throughout the MD&amp;A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).",

Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

Organic sales in Asia Pacific increased 3.0% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by India and the Greater China region.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was primarily due to an increase in Oral Care organic sales.

This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due primarily to an increase in Gross profit (50 bps) and a decrease in Other (income) expense, net (40 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was primarily due to cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (230 bps), mix (20 bps) and other, partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs (230 bps). The decrease in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to a gain on an investment.",

      "answer": "PM reported an 8.2% increase in Turkey's cigarette market, primarily attributed to increased in-bound tourism, particularly by Turkish expatriates, which boosted adult smoker average daily consumption. This tourism-driven growth was partially offset by a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade. In contrast, PEP identified Turkey as one of the international markets with volatile economic, political, and social conditions that create challenging operating environments. PEP actively manages foreign exchange risks through a $2.8 billion portfolio of foreign currency derivatives as of December 25, 2021, designed to offset exposure from operations in markets like Turkey, where currency fluctuations and controls pose material risks.

See 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' for further discussion.\n\n## Commodity Prices\n\nOur  commodity  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $1.6  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $1.1 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  At  the  end  of  2021,  the  potential  change  in  fair  value  of  commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $177 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nOur operations outside of the United States generated 44% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa, collectively, comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks  in  the  international  markets  in  which  our  products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2021,  favorable  foreign  exchange  contributed  1  percentage  point  to  net  revenue  growth,  primarily  due  to appreciation  in  the  Mexican  peso,  Canadian  dollar  and  South African  rand.  Currency  declines  against  the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.\n\nIn addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold,  including  in Argentina,  Brazil,  China,  Mexico,  the Middle  East,  Russia  and  Turkey,  and  currency  controls  or  fluctuations  in  certain  of  these  international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments.\n\nOur foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $1.9 billion  as  of  December 26, 2020. At the end of 2021, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $278 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.\n\nThe total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nOur interest  rate  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $2.1  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $3.0 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  Assuming  year-end  2021  investment  levels  and  variable  rate  debt,  a  1percentage-point  increase  in  interest  rates  would  have  decreased  our  net  interest  expense  in  2021  by  $47 million  due  to  higher  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  levels,  as  compared  with  our variable rate debt.\n\n## OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\n## Results of Operations - Consolidated Review\n\n## Volume\n\nPhysical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions,  including  the  preparation  of  our  annual  operating  plan  and  the  evaluation  of  our  business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level.",

This illicit trade, which negatively impacts legitimate tobacco companies, is a known challenge for Philip Morris International (PMI), as stated in their 10-K. Despite this challenge, PMI reported a 23.8% increase in operating income in the Middle East & Africa region, driven by favorable pricing, volume/mix improvements, and lower manufacturing costs.

The  FCTC  has  as  its  main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others.  The  FCTC  governing  body,  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  ('CoP'),  has  also  adopted  non-binding  guidelines  and  policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty.

See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

      "question": "How does the adoption of ASU 2022-02, which eliminates troubled debt restructuring accounting and enhances disclosure requirements, impact both COST's global reporting obligations and CL's financial statement disclosures, particularly in light of COST\u2019s mention of increasing global reporting complexity and CL's specific assessment that the standard would not have a material impact?",
      "answer": "ASU 2022-02 eliminates accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and enhances disclosure requirements for loan refinancings and restructurings made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. COST, which operates 276 warehouses internationally, noted that new global reporting obligations are increasing the cost and complexity of doing business. This indicates that standards like ASU 2022-02, which mandate enhanced disclosures, contribute to COST's growing compliance burden across its international markets. Meanwhile, CL adopted ASU 2022-02 beginning January 1, 2023, and specifically assessed that the standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Therefore, while both companies are subject to ASU 2022-02, COST experiences increased reporting complexity globally, whereas CL determined the standard had minimal financial impact, highlighting differing operational responses to the same accounting requirement.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COST \u2192 Disclosure Requirements: COST explicitly states that new global reporting obligations are increasing the cost and complexity of doing business, indicating sensitivity to evolving accounting standards like ASU 2022-02.",
        "Hop 2: Disclosure Requirements \u2192 ASU 2022-02: ASU 2022-02 enhances disclosure requirements for loan modifications made to borrowers in financial difficulty, replacing the previous TDR framework and increasing transparency and reporting burden.",
        "Hop 3: ASU 2022-02 \u2190 CL: CL adopted ASU 2022-02 effective January 1, 2023, and specifically assessed that the standard would not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements, showing a direct but low-impact application of the standard."

      "question": "How might MO's inflation-adjusted settlement obligations under the State Settlement Agreements be impacted if regulatory restrictions on flavorings, such as the EU's ban on menthol cigarettes, reduce product differentiation and lead to greater price sensitivity among adult smokers?",
      "answer": "MO's settlement obligations under the State Settlement Agreements are tied to inflation, with a minimum 3% increase or the CPI-U rate, whichever is higher. In 2022, inflation was projected to be around 7%, yet MO did not expect a material financial impact due to its ability to manage costs and maintain pricing power. However, if regulatory restrictions like the EU's menthol ban\u2014cited in PM's filing\u2014limit product differentiation, adult smokers may become more price-sensitive, shifting toward lower-priced brands. This down-trading effect would reduce overall market value and could lower MO's settlement payments tied to inflation and market share. The reduction in product differentiation and brand loyalty, as seen in PM\u2019s concerns, would thus indirectly affect MO\u2019s financial obligations by altering market dynamics and pricing structures.",

        "Hop 1: MO \u2192 Regulation: MO faces inflation-adjusted settlement obligations under the State Settlement Agreements, with payments tied to the higher of 3% or the CPI-U, which was approximately 7% in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Regulation \u2192 Product Differentiation: Regulatory restrictions on branding, flavorings (e.g., menthol bans), and packaging reduce the ability to differentiate products, increasing price sensitivity among adult consumers, as noted in PM's 10-K.",
        "Hop 3: Product Differentiation \u2190 PM: PM specifically cites the EU ban on menthol cigarettes and other flavor restrictions that have already limited product differentiation and could lead to broader market shifts toward lower-priced alternatives."

These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2021, the inflation calculation was approximately 7% based on the latest CPI-U data; however, the increase in the annual payments did not have a material impact on Altria's financial position. Altria believes that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022, but does not expect the corresponding increase in annual payments to result in a material financial impact. However, we will continue to monitor conditions related to the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment.\n\nFor a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below and Note 18. The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers' business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). The State Settlement Agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters. In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; limit the industry's ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.\n\nIn November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the 'STMSA') with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC. The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions. USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.\n\n## Other International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity\n\n- International, Federal, State and Local Regulation: Various states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches), such as legislation that (i) prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories, such as e-vapor, (ii) prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors, such as menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, (iii) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings and (iv) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products. The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products. As of February 22, 2022, multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products, and six states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Utah, New York and Illinois) and the District of Columbia have passed such legislation. Some of these states, such as New York, Utah and Illinois, exempt certain products that have received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway.\n\nThe legislation in California bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors, including menthol, mint and wintergreen. Following enactment of the flavor ban in August 2020, several registered California voters filed a referendum against the legislation. In January 2021 the requisite number of registered California voters signed a petition to place the question of whether the legislation should be affirmed or overturned on the next statewide general election ballot, which will likely take place in November 2022, unless a special statewide election is called earlier. As a result, the implementation of the legislation is delayed until after a vote on the referendum occurs.\n\nMassachusetts passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in e-vapor products. Similar legislation is pending in one other state.\n\nRestrictions on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products also have been instituted or proposed internationally.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal, state and local legislation and other governmental action, including through litigation. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL. Such action also could negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.",

          "chunk_text": "Some countries have adopted, or are considering adopting, packaging restrictions that could have an impact similar to plain packaging. Examples  of  such  restrictions  include  standardizing  the  shape  and  size  of  packages,  prohibiting  certain  colors  or  the  use  of  certain descriptive phrases on packaging, and requiring very large graphic health warnings that leave little space for branding.\n\nRestrictions and Bans on the Use of Ingredients: The WHO and others in the public health community have recommended restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in tobacco products, including menthol. Broad restrictions and ingredient bans would require us to reformulate our American blend tobacco products and could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term. In many countries, menthol bans would eliminate the entire category of mentholated tobacco products. The European Union banned cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco products with characterizing flavors. Other tobacco products, including heated tobacco products, are exempted from this flavor ban. The EU Commission is required to withdraw this exemption for a particular product category if it determines that there is a substantial change of circumstances, such as a significant increase of EU-wide sales volumes in such product category. Other countries may follow the EU's approach. Turkey banned menthol as of May 2020. Broader ingredient bans have been adopted by Brazil and Canada.\n\nBans  on  Display  of  Tobacco  Products  at  Retail: In  a  number  of  our  markets,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  Australia  and  Russia, governments have banned the display of tobacco products at the point of sale. Other countries are considering similar bans.\n\nBans and Restrictions on Advertising, Marketing, Promotions and Sponsorships: For many years, the FCTC has called for, and countries have  imposed,  partial  or  total  bans  on  tobacco  advertising,  marketing,  promotions  and  sponsorships,  including  bans  and  restrictions  on advertising on radio and television, in print and on the Internet. The FCTC's non-binding guidelines recommend that governments prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers.\n\nRestrictions  on  Product  Design: Some  members  of  the  public  health  community  are  calling  for  the  further  standardization  of  tobacco products by requiring, for example, that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter, which would amount to a ban on slim cigarettes, or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs. In addition, at its meeting in November 2016, the CoP adopted nonbinding guidelines recommending that countries regulate product design features that increase the attractiveness of tobacco products, such as the diameter of cigarettes and the use of flavor capsules.\n\nRestrictions on Public Smoking and Use of Nicotine-Containing Products in Public: The pace and scope of restrictions on the use of our products  have  increased  significantly  in  most  of  our  markets.  Many  countries  around  the  world  have  adopted,  or  are  likely  to  adopt, regulations  that  restrict  or  ban  smoking  and  use  of  nicotine-containing  products  in  public  and/or  work  places,  restaurants,  bars  and nightclubs.  Some  public  health  groups  have  called  for,  and  some  countries,  regional  governments  and  municipalities  have  adopted  or proposed, bans on smoking in outdoor places, as well as bans on smoking in cars (typically, when minors are present) and private homes.\n\nOther Regulatory Issues: Some  regulators  are  considering,  or  in  some  cases  have  adopted,  regulatory  measures  designed  to  reduce  the supply of tobacco products. These include regulations intended to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco products by, for example, reducing the overall number of tobacco retail licenses available or banning the sale of tobacco products within specified distances of certain public facilities. In addition, South Africa banned the sale of tobacco products, e-cigarettes, and electronic devices that heat tobacco for several months during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ban, which was lifted on August 17, 2020, resulted in a significant increase of illicit trade of tobacco products.\n\nIn a limited number of markets, most notably Japan, we are dependent on governmental approvals that may limit our pricing flexibility.\n\nThe  EU  Single-Use  Plastics  Directive,  which  will  require  tobacco  manufacturers  and  importers  to  cover  the  costs  of  public  collection systems for tobacco product filters, under Extended Producer Responsibility (\"EPR\") schemes, entered into force on July 2, 2019. To date, some member states transposed the Directive into national legislation. We expect remaining member states to transpose the EU Single-Use Plastics Directive into national legislation including EPR schemes by January 2023. While we cannot predict the impact of this initiative on our business at this time, we are monitoring developments in this area.\n\nIllicit  Trade: Illicit  tobacco  trade  creates  a  cheap  and  unregulated  supply  of  tobacco  products,  undermines  efforts  to  reduce  smoking prevalence, especially among youth, damages legitimate businesses and intellectual property rights, stimulates organized crime, increases corruption and reduces government tax revenue. We generally estimate that, excluding China and the U.S., illicit trade may account for as much as 12% of global cigarette consumption; this includes counterfeit, contraband and the persistent problem of 'illicit whites,' which are cigarettes legally produced in one jurisdiction for the sole purpose of being exported and illegally sold in another jurisdiction where they have no legitimate market. Currently, we estimate that illicit trade in the European Union accounted for approximately 8% of total cigarette consumption in 2021.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive utilizes option contracts as part of its foreign exchange risk management strategy to hedge portions of its foreign currency purchases, assets, and liabilities, with contract durations generally not exceeding 12 months. These contracts are used alongside other instruments like forwards and swaps to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on earnings. Similarly, PepsiCo is exposed to foreign exchange risk from foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business, particularly in markets like Mexico, Russia, and China, where it generated 25% of its consolidated net revenue in 2024. PepsiCo also uses derivatives, including foreign exchange forwards and options, to hedge forecasted transactions and firm commitments, with the objective of reducing earnings and cash flow volatility due to exchange rate fluctuations. Both companies rely on option contracts to manage foreign currency liabilities, aligning their strategies to mitigate exposure and stabilize financial outcomes.",

Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material, as it is the Company's policy to contract only with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, sourcing strategies, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company's treasury and risk management policies, which prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose. It is the Company's policy to enter into derivative instrument contracts with terms that match the underlying exposure being hedged. Provided below are details of the Company's exposures by type of risk and derivative instruments by type of hedge designation.\n\n## Valuation Considerations\n\nThe Company's derivative instruments include foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts. The fair value of these instruments are classified as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements.\n\nThe Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates (Level 2 valuation).\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company utilizes forward-starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rates for future debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates (Level 2 valuation).",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

      "answer": "PM USA experienced a 9.9% decline in cigarette shipment volume in the U.S. in 2023, while PM reported a 6.7% increase in international cigarette and HTU shipment volume in the same period. Given that PM USA fully and unconditionally guarantees Altria Group's obligations under its debt instruments, the domestic decline in cigarette volume could place pressure on PM USA's financial performance, potentially impacting its ability to support Altria\u2019s debt guarantees.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MO \u2192 PM USA: Altria Group's subsidiary PM USA guarantees all of Altria's debt obligations, making its financial health critical to Altria\u2019s capital structure.",
        "Hop 2: PM USA \u2192 Cigarettes: PM USA's cigarette shipments, which represent the majority of its business, declined by 9.9% in the U.S. in 2023, signaling potential revenue pressure.",
        "Hop 3: Cigarettes \u2190 PM: Internationally, PM saw cigarette and HTU shipment volume grow by 6.7%, with strong performance in Japan and Duty Free markets, offsetting some global declines."

However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets.

In the fourth quarter  of  2021,  we  exercised  our  option  to  accelerate  all  remaining  payments.

In contrast, COST explicitly states that as of August 28, 2022, it held no Level 1 or Level 3 financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, indicating a different risk management approach with no direct use of such derivatives. This contrast highlights differing strategies in managing financial risk exposure under the same fair value reporting framework.",

Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities.\n\n(b) Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability.\n\n(c) Based primarily on the price of our common stock.\n\n(d) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees' investment elections.\n\n(e) In connection with our acquisition of Rockstar, we recorded a liability for tax-related contingent consideration payable over up to 15 years, with an option to accelerate all remaining payments, with estimated maximum payments of approximately $1.1 billion, using current tax rates. The fair value of the liability is estimated using probability-weighted, discounted future cash flows at current tax rates. In the fourth quarter  of  2021,  we  exercised  our  option  to  accelerate  all  remaining  payments.  The  change  in  the  contingent  consideration  in  2021  is comprised of the fourth quarter payment of $773 million, a recognized pre-tax gain of $86 million ($66 million after-tax or $0.05 per share), recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, and a fair value decrease of $2 million, recorded in goodwill as a result of the finalization of purchase price allocation.\n\n(f) Based on London Interbank Offered Rate forward rates. As of December 25, 2021, we had no hedged fixed-rate debt. As of December 26, 2020, the carrying amount of hedged fixed-rate debt was $0.2 billion and classified on our balance sheet within short-term debt obligations. As of December 25, 2021, there were no fair value hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt. As of December 26, 2020, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt was a $2 million gain. As of December 25, 2021, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments on discontinued hedges was a $2 million net loss, which is being amortized over the remaining life of the related debt obligations.\n\n(g) Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates.\n\n(h) Primarily based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements.\n\n(i) Derivative  assets  and  liabilities  are  presented  on  a  gross  basis  on  our  balance  sheet.  Amounts  subject  to  enforceable  master  netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cashsettled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table as of December 25, 2021.",

The fair value of these instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges.\n\nLevel 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of over-the-counter ('OTC') currency exchange forwards, options and swaps; commodity forwards and options; net investment hedge contracts; and interest rate swaps. Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our bifurcated exchange options are valued, as derivative instrument liabilities, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related to the market price of the underlying note and associated credit spread combined with the share of price, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility of the JDE Peet's shares over the life of the option. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our derivative contracts do not have a legal right of set-off. We manage the credit risk in connection with these and all our derivatives by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.",

The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain events, the holder has the right to require the Company to purchase this security at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued  and  unpaid  interest  to  the  date  of  the  event.  Interest  on  all  outstanding  long-term  debt  is  payable  semiannually.

In contrast, CL analyzed the IRA\u2019s 15% minimum tax on book income and concluded it had no material impact on its consolidated financial statements in 2023. This divergence reflects different tax positions and financial structures: MO faces potential volatility due to unique book-tax timing differences, while CL\u2019s structure or income profile shielded it from immediate material effects under the new tax rule.",

      "answer": "KO reported $14,471 million in net sales to equity method investees in 2021, a group that includes Coca-Cola FEMSA, one of its largest bottling partners. Coca-Cola FEMSA operates in Colombia, covering most of the country, making it a key contributor to KO\u2019s 83% of global unit case volume outside the U.S. Meanwhile, CL reported a 7.0% net sales increase in Latin America in 2021, with Colombia cited as one of the growth drivers. While KO\u2019s dependency on Coca-Cola FEMSA in Colombia supports beverage distribution volume, CL\u2019s growth in the region reflects higher consumer demand for personal and home care products, indicating differing but regionally aligned performance dynamics.",

Total payments, primarily related to marketing, made to equity method investees were $516 million, $547 million and $897 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in net sales to equity method investees in 2021 was primarily due to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, purchases of beverage products from equity method investees were $496 million, $452 million and $426 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in purchases of beverage products in 2021 was primarily due to increased purchases of Monster products as a result of international expansion and category growth.\n\nThe following table presents the difference between calculated fair value, based on quoted closing prices of publicly traded shares, and our Company's carrying value in investments in publicly traded companies accounted for under the equity method (in millions):\n\n",

Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 42 percent of U.S. unit case volume. Unit case volume outside the United States represented 83 percent of the Company's worldwide unit case volume in 2021. The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 48 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\n\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

          "chunk_text": "\nNet sales in Latin America increased 7.0% in 2021 to $3,663, as volume growth of 1.0% and net selling price increases of 7.0% were partially offset by negative foreign exchange of 1.0%. Organic sales in Latin America increased 8.0% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in Latin America in 2021 versus 2020 was due to increases in Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the bar soap and underarm protection categories. The increase in Home Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the fabric softener and liquid cleaner categories.\n\nOperating profit in Latin America increased 4% in 2021 to $1,012, while as a percentage of Net sales it decreased 90 bps to 27.6%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to a decrease in Gross profit (150 bps), partially offset by a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses (20 bps) and a decrease in Other (income) expense, net (40 bps), all as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (740 bps), which were partially offset by cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (330 bps) and higher pricing. This decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to decreased advertising investment (70 bps), partially offset by higher overhead expenses (50 bps), primarily driven by higher logistics costs. The decrease in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to a value added tax refund.",

      "question": "How does Coca-Cola's (KO) revenue from the Asia Pacific (APAC) region compare to PepsiCo's (PEP) revenue mix from Convenient Food in the same geographic segment, given both companies operate in this region with different product focus?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola generated $4,682 million in third-party net operating revenues from the Asia Pacific (APAC) region in 2021, while PepsiCo reported that 80% of its APAC revenue in 2021 came from Convenient Food, compared to 20% from Beverages. This shows that while both companies operate in APAC, PepsiCo's revenue mix in the region is heavily tilted toward Convenient Food, whereas Coca-Cola\u2019s revenue in the region is entirely beverage-driven.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: KO \u2192 APAC: Coca-Cola generated $4,682 million in third-party net operating revenue from the Asia Pacific region in 2021, indicating its significant presence in the region.",
        "Hop 2: APAC \u2192 Convenient Food: PepsiCo's APAC segment derived 80% of its revenue from Convenient Food in 2021, showing a strong emphasis on this product category in the region.",
        "Hop 3: Convenient Food \u2190 PEP: PepsiCo categorizes its revenue by product type across regions, and in 2021, 80% of its APAC revenue was attributed to Convenient Food, contrasting with Coca-Cola's beverage-centric revenue model.",
        "Synthesis: This three-hop chain reveals that while both companies operate in the APAC region, their revenue composition differs significantly\u2014Coca-Cola is fully beverage-focused, whereas PepsiCo's APAC revenue is predominantly from Convenient Food."

Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. In the combustible product category, we predominantly sell American blend cigarette brands, such as Marlboro , L&amp;M , Parliament, Philip Morris and Chesterfield , which are the most popular across many of our markets. In the RRP product category, we predominantly sell Platform 1 devices and heated tobacco units under the IQOS brand  umbrella. We seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories, although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premium-price category.\n\nThe  competitive  environment  and  our  competitive  position  can  be  significantly  influenced  by  weak  economic  conditions,  erosion  of consumer  confidence,  competitors'  introduction  of  lower-price  products  or  innovative  products,  higher  tobacco  product  taxes,  higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products  and  restricts  adult  consumer  access  to  truthful  and  non-misleading  information  about  our  RRPs.  Competitors  in  our  industry include three large international tobacco companies, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and  local  tobacco  companies  and,  in  some  instances,  state-owned  tobacco  enterprises,  principally  in Algeria,  Egypt,  the  PRC,  Taiwan, Thailand  and  Vietnam.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative products  through  inappropriate  marketing  campaigns,  messaging  and  inferior  product  satisfaction,  while  not  relying  on  scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the  dissemination  of  inaccurate  and  misleading  information  about  our  RRPs,  all  of  which  could  have  a  mutual  adverse  effect  on  our profitability and results of operations.\n\n## Procurement and Raw Materials\n\nWe purchase tobacco leaf of various types, grades and styles throughout the world, mostly through independent tobacco suppliers. In 2021, we also contracted directly with farmers in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Pakistan and Poland. In 2021, direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 25% of PMI's global leaf requirements. The largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from Argentina, Brazil, China, Italy, Indonesia (mostly for domestic use in kretek products), Malawi, Mozambique, the Philippines, Turkey and the United States.\n\nWe  believe  that  there  is  an  adequate  supply  of  tobacco  leaf  in  the  world  markets  to  satisfy  our  current  and  anticipated  production requirements.",

          "chunk_text": "## Captive Insurance Companies\n\nIn accordance with local insurance regulations, our consolidated captive insurance companies are required to meet and maintain minimum solvency capital requirements. The Company elected to invest a majority of its solvency capital in a portfolio of marketable equity and debt securities. These securities are included in the disclosures above. The Company uses one of our consolidated captive insurance companies to reinsure group annuity insurance contracts that cover the obligations of certain of our European and Canadian pension plans. This captive's solvency capital funds included total equity and debt securities of $1,883 million and $1,643 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were classified in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets because the assets were not available to satisfy our current obligations.\n\n## NOTE 5: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company's financial performance and are referred to as 'market risks.' When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\n\nThe Company uses various types of derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative returns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect ex pected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes) a call option, or alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-derivative instruments, such as our foreign currency denominated third-party debt, in hedging relationships.\n\nAll derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid ex penses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with the same counterparty.\n\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our consolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the values of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings.\n\nFor derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures.\n\nThe Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to Note 17. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency ex change rates, commodity rates or other financial indices.

The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive entered into a Five Year Credit Agreement in 2022 with Citibank, N.A. serving as Administrative Agent and Arranger, indicating Citibank's role in structuring and overseeing a multi-lender financing facility. In contrast, Costco has maintained a co-branded credit card agreement with Citibank, N.A. since at least 2015, with twelve amendments through 2023, showing a long-term consumer financial services partnership. While Citibank's role with Colgate is focused on corporate lending and syndication, its relationship with Costco centers on credit card services, highlighting two distinct financial engagements over different timeframes and business functions.",

      "question": "How might the FCTC's encouragement of tobacco litigation and its influence on domestic legislation affect the financial exposure of both Philip Morris and Altria, particularly in light of proposed flavored product bans and excise tax increases in key U.S. states in 2024?",
      "answer": "The FCTC's encouragement of litigation against tobacco manufacturers increases the risk of large-scale legal claims against Philip Morris, as seen in Brazil, Canada, and Nigeria, where damages claimed run into billions of U.S. dollars. This global regulatory pressure also influences domestic legislative trends, such as the flavored tobacco bans enacted in six U.S. states and the District of Columbia, and under consideration in multiple others. These laws directly impact Altria\u2019s market access for products like menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, which could materially affect sales volume and market share. Additionally, proposed excise tax increases on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouches in 33 and 11 U.S. jurisdictions respectively, could further hinder adult smoker transition to reduced-risk alternatives, directly affecting Altria\u2019s strategic Vision. For Philip Morris, these legislative shifts\u2014partly shaped by FCTC recommendations\u2014compound litigation risks and could lead to unfavorable settlements or outcomes that materially affect financial performance, particularly in a fiscal year where new cases are anticipated to continue.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PM \u2192 FCTC: Philip Morris is subject to litigation encouraged by the FCTC, with significant damages claimed in Brazil, Canada, and Nigeria, ranging into billions of U.S. dollars.",
        "Hop 2: FCTC \u2192 Legislation: The FCTC recommends and in some cases requires signatory nations to enact legislation addressing tobacco use, which indirectly influences U.S. state-level legislation such as flavored product bans and excise tax increases.",
        "Hop 3: Legislation \u2190 MO: Altria faces financial and operational impacts from state-level legislation including bans on flavored tobacco products in six U.S. states and the District of Columbia, and excise taxes on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouches in 33 and 11 U.S. jurisdictions, respectively."

      "question": "Given Philip Morris's ongoing regulatory challenges in Thailand stemming from the WTO panel decision on customs valuation of cigarette imports, and Colgate-Palmolive's manufacturing presence in Thailand, how might the unresolved customs and tax compliance issues in Thailand impact Colgate-Palmolive's operational costs or regulatory risk exposure in the country?",
      "answer": "The WTO panel decision found that Thailand lacked grounds to challenge the customs valuation of Philip Morris's cigarette imports and obligated Thailand to revise its customs and tax practices. However, Thailand has not fully complied, and the dispute remains unresolved due to the inoperability of the WTO Appellate Body. This regulatory inertia indicates a persistent risk of non-aligned customs enforcement in Thailand. Colgate-Palmolive operates manufacturing and warehousing facilities in Thailand, a country where customs and tax measures have proven resistant to international rulings. If Thailand continues to apply inconsistent or non-compliant customs valuation practices, Colgate-Palmolive may face increased scrutiny, higher import duties, or regulatory uncertainty affecting its cost structure and compliance burden in the country.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PM \u2192 WTO Panel Decision: Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited was directly affected by Thai customs and tax measures on imported cigarettes, which were ruled non-compliant by a WTO panel in 2010. Thailand was obligated to revise its practices, but the Philippines claims non-compliance, indicating ongoing regulatory uncertainty.",
        "Hop 2: WTO Panel Decision \u2192 Thailand: The WTO decision created legal obligations for Thailand to reform customs valuation and tax treatment of cigarette imports, but Thailand has not fully complied, leaving customs enforcement in this area in a state of regulatory limbo.",
        "Hop 3: Thailand \u2190 CL: Colgate-Palmolive operates manufacturing and warehousing facilities in Thailand, meaning its operations are subject to the country\u2019s customs and tax regime. If Thailand continues to apply non-compliant or inconsistent customs valuation practices, CL may face increased regulatory risk or operational costs."

We describe certain pending matters in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies .\n\nIn November 2010, a World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") panel issued its decision in a dispute between the Philippines and Thailand, concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\") into Thailand. The decision concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the Thai government and created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports.  Thailand agreed to fully comply with the decision, but the Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision and commenced challenges at the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO Appellate Body is not operational, and the appeals by Thailand are suspended indefinitely. In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues and the countries have since agreed to seek the establishment of a bilateral consultative mechanism, with the goal of reaching a comprehensive settlement of their dispute, consistent with their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreements, as well as the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families in the country. We continue commercial activities in select locations where safety allows, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and supplies the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement. Production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended. On June 20, 2023, we announced the investment of $30 million in a new production facility in the Lviv region, in Western Ukraine. Preparatory work for the facility began in July 2023. The new production facility was completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and local production commenced in April 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our Ukrainian operations had approximately $0.6 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances.\n\nIn Russia, we are continuously assessing the evolving situation in the country. This includes regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. As of December 31, 2024, our Russian operations had approximately $2.7 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $1.0 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles).\n\nAdditionally, we hold a 23% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution B.V ., which was the holding company of JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), pursuant to Dutch law, PMI's distributor in Russia. On July 18, 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Trade filed a petition before the Arbitrazh Court of Moscow seeking the forced localization of JSC TK Megapolis. On December 5, 2024, JSC TK Megapolis registered the transfer of this equity interest to PMI affiliate ZAO Philip Morris Izhora. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. Related Parties - Equity Investments and Other and Item 8, Note 18.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact on cost of sales was approximately $580 million. In 2024, the impact on cost of sales was approximately 30% of the 2023 level, benefiting from lower prices for direct materials and utilities, despite continued pressure on tobacco leaf costs. In 2025, we expect certain inflationary elements such as direct materials and utilities to stabilize, with a moderate overall increase in inflationary pressures driven by tobacco leaf costs.\n\nInflationary impacts driven by higher wages have resulted from merit increases that reflect local inflation as we continuously evaluate our compensation and benefit offerings to be competitive with the current market. Increased transportation costs resulted from increased shipping rates for all modes of transportation (air, ocean and inland) due to ocean and air capacity constraints. Increases in",

      "answer": "PEP reported exposure to foreign exchange risk in Argentina due to its operations there, with foreign exchange derivatives totaling $2.8 billion in 2021, and a 10% unfavorable exchange rate change potentially decreasing net unrealized gains by $278 million. KO, through its bottler Coca-Cola FEMSA, operates in Argentina (specifically in Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and relies on this bottler as one of its top five globally, which collectively represented 41% of KO\u2019s worldwide unit case volume in 2021. KO also had net sales to equity method investees, including Coca-Cola FEMSA, totaling $14,471 million in 2021, showing a significant financial dependency on these bottlers. Therefore, both companies are exposed to Argentina, with PEP directly through FX risk and KO through operational and financial dependencies on Coca-Cola FEMSA.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nInflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' for further discussion.\n\n## Commodity Prices\n\nOur  commodity  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $1.6  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $1.1 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  At  the  end  of  2021,  the  potential  change  in  fair  value  of  commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $177 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nOur operations outside of the United States generated 44% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa, collectively, comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks  in  the  international  markets  in  which  our  products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2021,  favorable  foreign  exchange  contributed  1  percentage  point  to  net  revenue  growth,  primarily  due  to appreciation  in  the  Mexican  peso,  Canadian  dollar  and  South African  rand.  Currency  declines  against  the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.\n\nIn addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold,  including  in Argentina,  Brazil,  China,  Mexico,  the Middle  East,  Russia  and  Turkey,  and  currency  controls  or  fluctuations  in  certain  of  these  international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments.\n\nOur foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $1.9 billion  as  of  December 26, 2020. At the end of 2021, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $278 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.\n\nThe total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nOur interest  rate  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $2.1  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $3.0 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  Assuming  year-end  2021  investment  levels  and  variable  rate  debt,  a  1percentage-point  increase  in  interest  rates  would  have  decreased  our  net  interest  expense  in  2021  by  $47 million  due  to  higher  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  levels,  as  compared  with  our variable rate debt.\n\n## OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\n## Results of Operations - Consolidated Review\n\n## Volume\n\nPhysical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions,  including  the  preparation  of  our  annual  operating  plan  and  the  evaluation  of  our  business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level.",

Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 42 percent of U.S. unit case volume. Unit case volume outside the United States represented 83 percent of the Company's worldwide unit case volume in 2021. The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 48 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\n\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

Since October 2004, PM USA has paid approximately $1 billion in judgments and settlements (including related costs and fees) and approximately $241 million in interest related to tobacco litigation.

of business and guarantees (including third-party guarantees) outstanding at December 31, 2023. From time to time, we also issue lines of credit to affiliated entities. As further discussed in Note 19, as part of the supplier financing program, Altria guarantees the financial obligations of ALCS under the financing program agreement. In addition, as discussed below in Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information and in Note 10, PM USA guarantees our obligations under our outstanding debt securities, any borrowings under our Credit Agreement and any amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Long-Term Debt and Interest on Borrowings - In addition to maturities of long-term debt, we make interest payments based on stated coupon interest rates.

Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). At December 31, 2023, purchase obligations for inventory and production costs for the next 12 months were $0.9 billion and $2.5 billion thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At December 31, 2023, we had $0.7 billion of other purchase obligation commitments for marketing, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services, which occur through the ordinary course of business. The majority of these commitments are expected to be satisfied within 12 months. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and are excluded from the amounts above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation - As discussed previously and in Note 19, PM USA has entered into State Settlement Agreements with the states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories that call for certain payments. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. For further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision under the MSA, see Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation - NPM Adjustment Disputes in Note 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Based on current agreements, estimated market share, estimated annual industry volume decline rates and inflation rates, the estimated amounts that we may charge to cost of sales for payments related to State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are $3.4 billion on average for the next three years. The estimated amount for 2024 includes settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. We expect PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to pay these fees will terminate in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, the amount excludes the potential impact of any NPM Adjustment Items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The estimated amounts due under the State Settlement Agreements charged to cost of sales in each year are generally paid in April of the following year. The amounts charged to cost of sales for FDA user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred. We paid approximately $4.3 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees, primarily all of which was paid in the second quarter of each period. As previously stated, the payments due under the terms of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors, including volume, operating income, inflation and certain contingent events and, in general, are allocated based on each manufacturer's market share. The future payment amounts discussed above are estimates, and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results. For further discussion on the potential impact of inflation on future payments, see Operating Results by Business Segment - State Settlement Agreements . |\n| Litigation-Related Deposits and Payments - With respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal, to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals, as of December 31, 2023, PM USA had posted appeal bonds totaling $35 million, which have been collateralized with restricted cash that is included in assets on our consolidated balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation is subject to uncertainty, and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as more fully disclosed in Note 19, Item 3 and Item 1A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

      "answer": "CL issues stock options that generally vest ratably over three years, with a contractual term of eight years post-2019. In contrast, PM grants RSU awards that typically vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. For CL, this means compensation expense is recognized evenly over the three-year vesting period. For PM, the fair value of RSU awards is amortized to expense over the restriction period, which is typically three years after the award date, or earlier upon death, disability, or reaching age 58. As of December 31, 2023, PM had $160 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested RSUs, expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately seventeen months. This indicates that while both companies align on a three-year vesting horizon, PM's structure allows for more accelerated expense recognition based on specific triggering events.",

      "answer": "Regulatory restrictions on product differentiation, such as flavor bans and standardized packaging, significantly impair both PM and MO's ability to maintain brand equity and pricing power. PM faces specific risks from the EU's ban on characterizing flavors in cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco, menthol bans in Turkey and Brazil, and potential future restrictions on slim cigarettes and flavor capsules. These limitations reduce PM\u2019s ability to differentiate products, especially in international markets where they estimate illicit trade accounts for 8% of EU cigarette consumption, further eroding legitimate brand value and pricing control. Similarly, MO faces flavor bans in six U.S. states and the District of Columbia, including California\u2019s broad restriction on menthol, mint, and wintergreen, which is currently delayed due to a referendum. These bans, along with proposed nicotine caps in Massachusetts, constrain MO\u2019s ability to market differentiated products and maintain premium pricing. Both companies are also restricted in advertising and branding through global FCTC guidelines and domestic regulations like the State Settlement Agreements, which prohibit youth-targeted marketing and outdoor advertising, further limiting brand equity development and pricing flexibility.",

        "Hop 1: PM \u2192 Product Differentiation: PM faces regulatory restrictions such as flavor bans (e.g., menthol in EU, Turkey, Brazil), standardized packaging, and advertising limitations that reduce its ability to differentiate products and maintain brand equity, especially in international markets where illicit trade already accounts for 8% of EU cigarette consumption.",
        "Hop 2: Product Differentiation \u2192 Regulation: Regulatory requirements, including FCTC guidelines and national laws, limit branding, advertising, and product design changes, directly constraining the ability of tobacco companies to differentiate their products and maintain premium pricing.",

          "chunk_text": "Some countries have adopted, or are considering adopting, packaging restrictions that could have an impact similar to plain packaging. Examples  of  such  restrictions  include  standardizing  the  shape  and  size  of  packages,  prohibiting  certain  colors  or  the  use  of  certain descriptive phrases on packaging, and requiring very large graphic health warnings that leave little space for branding.\n\nRestrictions and Bans on the Use of Ingredients: The WHO and others in the public health community have recommended restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in tobacco products, including menthol. Broad restrictions and ingredient bans would require us to reformulate our American blend tobacco products and could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term. In many countries, menthol bans would eliminate the entire category of mentholated tobacco products. The European Union banned cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco products with characterizing flavors. Other tobacco products, including heated tobacco products, are exempted from this flavor ban. The EU Commission is required to withdraw this exemption for a particular product category if it determines that there is a substantial change of circumstances, such as a significant increase of EU-wide sales volumes in such product category. Other countries may follow the EU's approach. Turkey banned menthol as of May 2020. Broader ingredient bans have been adopted by Brazil and Canada.\n\nBans  on  Display  of  Tobacco  Products  at  Retail: In  a  number  of  our  markets,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  Australia  and  Russia, governments have banned the display of tobacco products at the point of sale. Other countries are considering similar bans.\n\nBans and Restrictions on Advertising, Marketing, Promotions and Sponsorships: For many years, the FCTC has called for, and countries have  imposed,  partial  or  total  bans  on  tobacco  advertising,  marketing,  promotions  and  sponsorships,  including  bans  and  restrictions  on advertising on radio and television, in print and on the Internet. The FCTC's non-binding guidelines recommend that governments prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers.\n\nRestrictions  on  Product  Design: Some  members  of  the  public  health  community  are  calling  for  the  further  standardization  of  tobacco products by requiring, for example, that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter, which would amount to a ban on slim cigarettes, or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs. In addition, at its meeting in November 2016, the CoP adopted nonbinding guidelines recommending that countries regulate product design features that increase the attractiveness of tobacco products, such as the diameter of cigarettes and the use of flavor capsules.\n\nRestrictions on Public Smoking and Use of Nicotine-Containing Products in Public: The pace and scope of restrictions on the use of our products  have  increased  significantly  in  most  of  our  markets.  Many  countries  around  the  world  have  adopted,  or  are  likely  to  adopt, regulations  that  restrict  or  ban  smoking  and  use  of  nicotine-containing  products  in  public  and/or  work  places,  restaurants,  bars  and nightclubs.  Some  public  health  groups  have  called  for,  and  some  countries,  regional  governments  and  municipalities  have  adopted  or proposed, bans on smoking in outdoor places, as well as bans on smoking in cars (typically, when minors are present) and private homes.\n\nOther Regulatory Issues: Some  regulators  are  considering,  or  in  some  cases  have  adopted,  regulatory  measures  designed  to  reduce  the supply of tobacco products. These include regulations intended to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco products by, for example, reducing the overall number of tobacco retail licenses available or banning the sale of tobacco products within specified distances of certain public facilities. In addition, South Africa banned the sale of tobacco products, e-cigarettes, and electronic devices that heat tobacco for several months during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ban, which was lifted on August 17, 2020, resulted in a significant increase of illicit trade of tobacco products.\n\nIn a limited number of markets, most notably Japan, we are dependent on governmental approvals that may limit our pricing flexibility.\n\nThe  EU  Single-Use  Plastics  Directive,  which  will  require  tobacco  manufacturers  and  importers  to  cover  the  costs  of  public  collection systems for tobacco product filters, under Extended Producer Responsibility (\"EPR\") schemes, entered into force on July 2, 2019. To date, some member states transposed the Directive into national legislation. We expect remaining member states to transpose the EU Single-Use Plastics Directive into national legislation including EPR schemes by January 2023. While we cannot predict the impact of this initiative on our business at this time, we are monitoring developments in this area.\n\nIllicit  Trade: Illicit  tobacco  trade  creates  a  cheap  and  unregulated  supply  of  tobacco  products,  undermines  efforts  to  reduce  smoking prevalence, especially among youth, damages legitimate businesses and intellectual property rights, stimulates organized crime, increases corruption and reduces government tax revenue. We generally estimate that, excluding China and the U.S., illicit trade may account for as much as 12% of global cigarette consumption; this includes counterfeit, contraband and the persistent problem of 'illicit whites,' which are cigarettes legally produced in one jurisdiction for the sole purpose of being exported and illegally sold in another jurisdiction where they have no legitimate market. Currently, we estimate that illicit trade in the European Union accounted for approximately 8% of total cigarette consumption in 2021.",

These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2021, the inflation calculation was approximately 7% based on the latest CPI-U data; however, the increase in the annual payments did not have a material impact on Altria's financial position. Altria believes that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022, but does not expect the corresponding increase in annual payments to result in a material financial impact. However, we will continue to monitor conditions related to the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment.\n\nFor a discussion of the impact of the State Settlement Agreements on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below and Note 18. The State Settlement Agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers' business operations, including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising, payments for product placement and free sampling (except in adult-only facilities). The State Settlement Agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non-tobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters. In addition, the State Settlement Agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes; impose requirements regarding lobbying activities; limit the industry's ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws; and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco-related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations.\n\nIn November 1998, USSTC entered into the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (the 'STMSA') with the attorneys general of various states and United States territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against USSTC. The STMSA required USSTC to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions. USSTC is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the STMSA.\n\n## Other International, Federal, State and Local Regulation and Governmental and Private Activity\n\n- International, Federal, State and Local Regulation: Various states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products (including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches), such as legislation that (i) prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories, such as e-vapor, (ii) prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors, such as menthol cigarettes and flavored e-vapor products, (iii) requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings and (iv) restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products. The legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products, the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited, and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions. For example, a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint- or wintergreen-flavored products. As of February 22, 2022, multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products, and six states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Utah, New York and Illinois) and the District of Columbia have passed such legislation. Some of these states, such as New York, Utah and Illinois, exempt certain products that have received FDA market authorization through the PMTA pathway.\n\nThe legislation in California bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors, including menthol, mint and wintergreen. Following enactment of the flavor ban in August 2020, several registered California voters filed a referendum against the legislation. In January 2021 the requisite number of registered California voters signed a petition to place the question of whether the legislation should be affirmed or overturned on the next statewide general election ballot, which will likely take place in November 2022, unless a special statewide election is called earlier. As a result, the implementation of the legislation is delayed until after a vote on the referendum occurs.\n\nMassachusetts passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in e-vapor products. Similar legislation is pending in one other state.\n\nRestrictions on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products also have been instituted or proposed internationally.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal, state and local legislation and other governmental action, including through litigation. It is possible, however, that legislation, regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL. Such action also could negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.",

Meanwhile, CL reported a 7.0% net sales increase in Latin America in 2021, with Argentina being one of the key growth drivers.

Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

Organic sales in Latin America increased 8.0% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in Latin America in 2021 versus 2020 was due to increases in Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories. The increase in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the bar soap and underarm protection categories.

In contrast, The Coca-Cola Company (KO) invests in private equity funds that are valued using NAV derived from valuation models incorporating unobservable inputs, as these funds are typically closed-end and not eligible for redemption. According to the evidence, KO's private equity fund investments are subject to liquidity constraints, with distributions only occurring as underlying assets are liquidated or distributed, unlike PMI's derivatives which are marked-to-market using readily available data. This reflects a key distinction in how both companies apply valuation models\u2014PMI with high liquidity and observable inputs, and KO with illiquid, model-dependent valuations.",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\n\nAs we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our ov erall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adv erse effects that the v olatility of these markets may hav e on our operating results.\n\nWe principally utilize deriv ativ e instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from v olatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our deriv ativ e activ ity and the types of deriv ativ e instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 10, Financial Instruments .\n\nMany of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create v olatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the  U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated  reporting  generally  results  in  a  cumulativ e  translation  adjustment  to  other  comprehensiv e  income  within  equity. A  stronger  U.S.  dollar relativ e to other functional currencies adv ersely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate v olatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Operations by Operating Segment under Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results for  currency  exchange  effects  on  our  financial  results.  T hroughout  our  discussion  and  analysis  of  results,  we  isolate  currency  impacts  and supplementally prov ide net rev enues, operating income and diluted earnings per share on a constant currency basis. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, recent currency dev aluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting .\n\nWe also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather  conditions,  gov ernment  policy  and  regulation  and  the  macroeconomic  env ironment.  Refer  to Recent  Developments  and  Significant  Items Affecting Comparability and Financial Outlook above for updates on recent supply chain, labor and other disruptions that are increasing operating costs and  impacting  our  results.  T o  manage  input  cost  v olatility  and  inflation,  we  enter  into  forward  purchase  agreements  and  other  deriv ativ e  financial instruments. We also pursue productiv ity and cost sav ing measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings.\n\nWe regularly ev aluate our v ariable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures  include  mov ements  in  U.S.  T reasury  rates,  corporate  credit  spreads,  commercial  paper  rates  as  well  as  limited  debt  tied  to  Secured Overnight  Financing  Rates  ('SOFR').  We  periodically  use  interest  rate  swaps  and  forward  interest  rate  contracts  to  achiev e  a  desired  proportion  of variable  v ersus  fixed-rate  debt  based  on  current  and  projected  market  conditions.  For  more  information  on  our  debt  activ ity,  see  Note  9, Debt  and Borrowing Arrangements .\n\nSee Note 10, Financial Instruments , for more information on our deriv ativ e activ ity.\n\n## Value at Risk\n\nWe use a value at risk ('VAR') computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair v alue of our interest rate-sensitiv e financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity price-sensitiv e deriv ativ e financial instruments. T he VAR analysis was done separately as of each quarter end for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios using historical market mov ements. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receiv ables, and net inv estments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the abov e-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.",

      "answer": "The 13.2% increase in South Africa's tobacco market volume (as reported by PMI) was partly due to a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade following the pandemic-related sales ban. For Altria, illicit trade in tobacco products is explicitly cited as a risk factor that could materially adversely affect its investment in JUUL by undermining brand integrity and consumer trust. Meanwhile, PepsiCo has acknowledged socioeconomic program liabilities in South Africa, which include obligations tied to market dynamics and regulatory conditions in the region.

Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our tobacco operating companies' and investees' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes; imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact Altria's consolidated results of operations and cash flows, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL, and the businesses of its tobacco operating companies and investees; or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies communicate with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities, enforce wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products and, when necessary, litigate to protect their trademarks.\n\n## Price, Availability and Quality of Tobacco, Other Raw Materials, Ingredients and Component Parts\n\nShifts in crops (such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns), government restrictions and mandated prices, production control programs, economic trade sanctions, import duties and tariffs, international trade disruptions, inflation, geopolitical instability, climate and environmental changes and disruptions due to man-made or natural disasters may increase the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco or other raw materials or ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our companies' and our investees' products. Any significant change in the price, availability or quality of tobacco, other raw materials, ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our products and those of our investees could restrict our tobacco operating companies' and investees' ability to continue manufacturing and marketing existing products or impact adult consumer product acceptability and adversely affect our tobacco operating companies' and investees' profitability and businesses.\n\nWith respect to tobacco, as with other agricultural commodities, crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. Additionally, the price and availability of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand. Economic conditions, including inflation and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, are unpredictable, which, among other factors, may result in changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production which could negatively impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply. In addition, as consumer demand increases for smoke-free products and decreases for combustible products, the volume of tobacco leaf required for production may decrease. The reduced demand for tobacco leaf may result in the reduced supply and availability of domestic tobacco as growers divert resources to other crops, which could result in increased costs to our tobacco operating companies.\n\nTobacco production in certain countries also is subject to a variety of controls, including government-mandated prices and production control programs.  Moreover, certain types of tobacco are only available in limited geographies, including geographies experiencing political instability or government prohibitions on the import or export of tobacco, and loss of their availability could impair our subsidiaries' ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also may limit access to and increase the cost of raw materials, component parts and personal protective equipment as United States and global suppliers may temporarily shut down facilities or use different production schedules with lower productivity in order to address exposure to the virus or as a result of a government mandate. In addition, (i) current labor market dynamics indicate labor shortages, with employers in a number of industries having difficulty employing workers and (ii) supply chain dynamics reflect failures and delays resulting from various issues including labor shortages, logistical problems and weather-related incidents. These labor shortages and supply failures and delays have led to certain increases in raw material (for example, resins used in our packaging), ingredient and component part prices and may lead to supply chain disruptions; however, to date, the impact on our operating companies and investees has been immaterial. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, labor market dynamics and supply chain disruptions outlined above may continue, which could adversely affect our subsidiaries' and investees' profitability and businesses. Recent economic conditions reflect an increased rate of inflation. To date, higher inflation has not had a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability. Although Altria anticipates inflation will continue at elevated levels in 2022, it is not expected to have a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability.\n\nIn addition, government taxes, restrictions and prohibitions on the sale and use of certain products may limit access to, and increase the costs of, raw materials and component parts and, potentially, impede our ability to sell certain of our products.

      "answer": "The 2010 WTO panel decision ruled that Thailand had no basis to challenge Philip Morris Thailand's declared customs values, creating obligations for Thailand to revise its import-related laws and practices. However, the Philippines claims Thailand has not fully complied, leaving the dispute unresolved and customs valuation risks persistent for PM Thailand. Meanwhile, PepsiCo reported mid-single-digit growth in Thailand in both convenient foods and beverage unit volumes in 2024, suggesting it has managed to grow despite the same regulatory environment. This contrast indicates that while Philip Morris faces unresolved trade disputes that could affect its cost structure and market access, PepsiCo has achieved volume growth in Thailand, potentially benefiting from more stable import and tax treatment under the current regulatory framework.",

We describe certain pending matters in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies .\n\nIn November 2010, a World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") panel issued its decision in a dispute between the Philippines and Thailand, concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\") into Thailand. The decision concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the Thai government and created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports.  Thailand agreed to fully comply with the decision, but the Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision and commenced challenges at the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO Appellate Body is not operational, and the appeals by Thailand are suspended indefinitely. In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues and the countries have since agreed to seek the establishment of a bilateral consultative mechanism, with the goal of reaching a comprehensive settlement of their dispute, consistent with their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreements, as well as the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nIn Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families in the country. We continue commercial activities in select locations where safety allows, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and supplies the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement. Production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended. On June 20, 2023, we announced the investment of $30 million in a new production facility in the Lviv region, in Western Ukraine. Preparatory work for the facility began in July 2023. The new production facility was completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and local production commenced in April 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our Ukrainian operations had approximately $0.6 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances.\n\nIn Russia, we are continuously assessing the evolving situation in the country. This includes regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, our ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. As of December 31, 2024, our Russian operations had approximately $2.7 billion in total assets, ex cluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $1.0 billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles).\n\nAdditionally, we hold a 23% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution B.V ., which was the holding company of JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), pursuant to Dutch law, PMI's distributor in Russia. On July 18, 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Trade filed a petition before the Arbitrazh Court of Moscow seeking the forced localization of JSC TK Megapolis. On December 5, 2024, JSC TK Megapolis registered the transfer of this equity interest to PMI affiliate ZAO Philip Morris Izhora. For further details, see Item 8, Note 6.

These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and affect KO's foreign currency liabilities by deferring gains and losses in AOCI until the hedged transactions occur. Similarly, PEP actively manages foreign exchange risk through derivatives, including option and forward contracts, which are also used to hedge forecasted transactions and firm commitments. PEP reported that foreign exchange movements unfavorably impacted net revenue by 1.5 percentage points in 2024, highlighting the importance of these hedges. Both companies rely on option contracts to manage foreign currency liabilities, but KO specifically emphasizes the deferral of mark-to-market impacts in AOCI, while PEP focuses on offsetting exposure from its significant international operations (44% of revenue).",

          "chunk_text": "## Captive Insurance Companies\n\nIn accordance with local insurance regulations, our consolidated captive insurance companies are required to meet and maintain minimum solvency capital requirements. The Company elected to invest a majority of its solvency capital in a portfolio of marketable equity and debt securities. These securities are included in the disclosures above. The Company uses one of our consolidated captive insurance companies to reinsure group annuity insurance contracts that cover the obligations of certain of our European and Canadian pension plans. This captive's solvency capital funds included total equity and debt securities of $1,883 million and $1,643 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were classified in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets because the assets were not available to satisfy our current obligations.\n\n## NOTE 5: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company's financial performance and are referred to as 'market risks.' When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\n\nThe Company uses various types of derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative returns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect ex pected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes) a call option, or alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-derivative instruments, such as our foreign currency denominated third-party debt, in hedging relationships.\n\nAll derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid ex penses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with the same counterparty.\n\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our consolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the values of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings.\n\nFor derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures.\n\nThe Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to Note 17. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency ex change rates, commodity rates or other financial indices. The Company does not view the fair",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our tobacco operating companies' and investees' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes; imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact Altria's consolidated results of operations and cash flows, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL, and the businesses of its tobacco operating companies and investees; or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies communicate with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities, enforce wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products and, when necessary, litigate to protect their trademarks.\n\n## Price, Availability and Quality of Tobacco, Other Raw Materials, Ingredients and Component Parts\n\nShifts in crops (such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns), government restrictions and mandated prices, production control programs, economic trade sanctions, import duties and tariffs, international trade disruptions, inflation, geopolitical instability, climate and environmental changes and disruptions due to man-made or natural disasters may increase the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco or other raw materials or ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our companies' and our investees' products. Any significant change in the price, availability or quality of tobacco, other raw materials, ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our products and those of our investees could restrict our tobacco operating companies' and investees' ability to continue manufacturing and marketing existing products or impact adult consumer product acceptability and adversely affect our tobacco operating companies' and investees' profitability and businesses.\n\nWith respect to tobacco, as with other agricultural commodities, crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. Additionally, the price and availability of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand. Economic conditions, including inflation and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, are unpredictable, which, among other factors, may result in changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production which could negatively impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply. In addition, as consumer demand increases for smoke-free products and decreases for combustible products, the volume of tobacco leaf required for production may decrease. The reduced demand for tobacco leaf may result in the reduced supply and availability of domestic tobacco as growers divert resources to other crops, which could result in increased costs to our tobacco operating companies.\n\nTobacco production in certain countries also is subject to a variety of controls, including government-mandated prices and production control programs.  Moreover, certain types of tobacco are only available in limited geographies, including geographies experiencing political instability or government prohibitions on the import or export of tobacco, and loss of their availability could impair our subsidiaries' ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also may limit access to and increase the cost of raw materials, component parts and personal protective equipment as United States and global suppliers may temporarily shut down facilities or use different production schedules with lower productivity in order to address exposure to the virus or as a result of a government mandate. In addition, (i) current labor market dynamics indicate labor shortages, with employers in a number of industries having difficulty employing workers and (ii) supply chain dynamics reflect failures and delays resulting from various issues including labor shortages, logistical problems and weather-related incidents. These labor shortages and supply failures and delays have led to certain increases in raw material (for example, resins used in our packaging), ingredient and component part prices and may lead to supply chain disruptions; however, to date, the impact on our operating companies and investees has been immaterial.

      "answer": "The 8.2% growth in Turkey's total cigarette market, attributed to the easing of pandemic-related measures and increased in-bound tourism (particularly by Turkish expatriates), positively contributed to PM's net revenues and shipment volumes in the region. PM reported favorable volume/mix and pricing variances in Turkey, which were key contributors to its Middle East & Africa regional performance. Meanwhile, CL operates manufacturing and warehousing facilities in Turkey as part of its global Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment, indicating a significant operational presence in the country. Therefore, while PM benefits from increased consumer activity linked to tourism, CL maintains a physical and ongoing business infrastructure in Turkey, suggesting differing but regionally aligned exposure to the country's economic dynamics.",

      "question": "How does the implementation of advertising bans under the FCTC influence Philip Morris's marketing strategies, and how might this regulatory pressure compare to the challenges faced by Altria in markets subject to similar FCTC guidelines?",
      "answer": "The implementation of advertising bans under the FCTC has significantly constrained Philip Morris\u2019s ability to market its products, with restrictions on advertising across radio, television, print, and the internet, as well as limitations on branding and communication with adult smokers. These bans have forced Philip Morris to adapt by reducing reliance on traditional marketing and shifting toward alternative strategies, such as product reformulation and exploring new product categories like heated tobacco products, which remain exempt from flavor bans in the EU. Meanwhile, Altria operates in markets subject to similar FCTC guidelines and faces parallel regulatory pressures, including the potential for increased excise taxes and the impact of international treaty-driven policies on domestic regulatory trends. Both companies are affected by the FCTC\u2019s global push for stricter tobacco control, but Altria\u2019s exposure to U.S. federal regulation\u2014such as FDA oversight and potential excise tax increases\u2014adds a unique layer of complexity compared to Philip Morris\u2019s more internationally diversified regulatory landscape.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PM \u2192 Advertising Bans: Philip Morris is directly impacted by advertising bans recommended by the FCTC, including restrictions on radio, TV, print, and internet advertising, which limit its ability to communicate with adult smokers and reduce brand visibility.",
        "Hop 2: Advertising Bans \u2192 FCTC: The FCTC has long advocated for comprehensive advertising bans, recommending that governments prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers, which has led to the adoption of such bans in multiple countries.",
        "Hop 3: FCTC \u2190 MO: Altria is subject to the influence of the FCTC through its impact on U.S. regulatory policy, even though the U.S. is not a party to the treaty. The FCTC\u2019s global agenda influences domestic policy trends, such as increased excise taxes and FDA regulation, which directly affect Altria\u2019s operating environment."

Examples  of  such  restrictions  include  standardizing  the  shape  and  size  of  packages,  prohibiting  certain  colors  or  the  use  of  certain descriptive phrases on packaging, and requiring very large graphic health warnings that leave little space for branding.\n\nRestrictions and Bans on the Use of Ingredients: The WHO and others in the public health community have recommended restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in tobacco products, including menthol. Broad restrictions and ingredient bans would require us to reformulate our American blend tobacco products and could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term. In many countries, menthol bans would eliminate the entire category of mentholated tobacco products. The European Union banned cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco products with characterizing flavors. Other tobacco products, including heated tobacco products, are exempted from this flavor ban. The EU Commission is required to withdraw this exemption for a particular product category if it determines that there is a substantial change of circumstances, such as a significant increase of EU-wide sales volumes in such product category. Other countries may follow the EU's approach. Turkey banned menthol as of May 2020. Broader ingredient bans have been adopted by Brazil and Canada.\n\nBans  on  Display  of  Tobacco  Products  at  Retail: In  a  number  of  our  markets,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  Australia  and  Russia, governments have banned the display of tobacco products at the point of sale.

The FCTC's non-binding guidelines recommend that governments prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers.\n\nRestrictions  on  Product  Design: Some  members  of  the  public  health  community  are  calling  for  the  further  standardization  of  tobacco products by requiring, for example, that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter, which would amount to a ban on slim cigarettes, or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs. In addition, at its meeting in November 2016, the CoP adopted nonbinding guidelines recommending that countries regulate product design features that increase the attractiveness of tobacco products, such as the diameter of cigarettes and the use of flavor capsules.\n\nRestrictions on Public Smoking and Use of Nicotine-Containing Products in Public: The pace and scope of restrictions on the use of our products  have  increased  significantly  in  most  of  our  markets.  Many  countries  around  the  world  have  adopted,  or  are  likely  to  adopt, regulations  that  restrict  or  ban  smoking  and  use  of  nicotine-containing  products  in  public  and/or  work  places,  restaurants,  bars  and nightclubs.  Some  public  health  groups  have  called  for,  and  some  countries,  regional  governments  and  municipalities  have  adopted  or proposed, bans on smoking in outdoor places, as well as bans on smoking in cars (typically, when minors are present) and private homes.\n\nOther Regulatory Issues: Some  regulators  are  considering,  or  in  some  cases  have  adopted,  regulatory  measures  designed  to  reduce  the supply of tobacco products. These include regulations intended to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco products by, for example, reducing the overall number of tobacco retail licenses available or banning the sale of tobacco products within specified distances of certain public facilities. In addition, South Africa banned the sale of tobacco products, e-cigarettes, and electronic devices that heat tobacco for several months during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ban, which was lifted on August 17, 2020, resulted in a significant increase of illicit trade of tobacco products.\n\nIn a limited number of markets, most notably Japan, we are dependent on governmental approvals that may limit our pricing flexibility.\n\nThe  EU  Single-Use  Plastics  Directive,  which  will  require  tobacco  manufacturers  and  importers  to  cover  the  costs  of  public  collection systems for tobacco product filters, under Extended Producer Responsibility (\"EPR\") schemes, entered into force on July 2, 2019. To date, some member states transposed the Directive into national legislation. We expect remaining member states to transpose the EU Single-Use Plastics Directive into national legislation including EPR schemes by January 2023. While we cannot predict the impact of this initiative on our business at this time, we are monitoring developments in this area.\n\nIllicit  Trade: Illicit  tobacco  trade  creates  a  cheap  and  unregulated  supply  of  tobacco  products,  undermines  efforts  to  reduce  smoking prevalence, especially among youth, damages legitimate businesses and intellectual property rights, stimulates organized crime, increases corruption and reduces government tax revenue. We generally estimate that, excluding China and the U.S., illicit trade may account for as much as 12% of global cigarette consumption; this includes counterfeit, contraband and the persistent problem of 'illicit whites,' which are cigarettes legally produced in one jurisdiction for the sole purpose of being exported and illegally sold in another jurisdiction where they have no legitimate market. Currently, we estimate that illicit trade in the European Union accounted for approximately 8% of total cigarette consumption in 2021.",

The cost of the FDA user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to FDA user fees and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares, all as prescribed by the FSPTCA and FDA regulations. Payments for user fees are adjusted for several factors, including market share and industry volume. For a discussion of the impact of the FDA user fee payments on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below. In addition, compliance with the FSPTCA's regulatory requirements has resulted, and will continue to result, in additional costs for Altria's tobacco operating companies. The amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year to date period but could become material, either individually or in the aggregate, to one or more of Altria's tobacco subsidiaries.\n\n- Investigation and Enforcement: The FDA has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it, including document requests and other required information submissions, facility inspections, examinations and investigations, injunction proceedings, monetary penalties, product withdrawal and recall orders, and product seizures. Investigations or enforcement actions could result in significant costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the business of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\n## Excise Taxes\n\nTobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the United States. Significant increases in tobacco-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted (including with respect to e-vapor products) and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal, state and local levels within the United States. The frequency and magnitude of excise tax increases can be influenced by various factors, including the composition of executive and legislative bodies.\n\nDuring 2021, Congress considered legislation that would have significantly increased the federal excise tax for all tobacco products and created a new tax for e-vapor products and other products containing nicotine that are not currently subject to a tobacco federal excise tax ('novel tobacco products'). The U.S. House of Representatives removed the proposal to increase the federal excise tax on tobacco products currently subject to the tax from the legislation it was considering, but retained the proposed nicotine tax for novel tobacco products. The U.S. Senate debated the legislation and removed the nicotine tax for novel tobacco products; however, as of February 22, 2022, the legislation is still pending before the Senate and could be subject to further tax related amendments.\n\nFederal, state and local cigarette excise taxes have increased substantially over the past two decades, far outpacing the rate of inflation. Between the end of 1998 and February 22, 2022, the weighted-average state cigarette excise tax increased from $0.36 to $1.89 per pack. As of February 22, 2022, no state has enacted new legislation increasing cigarette excise taxes in 2022, but various increases are under consideration or have been proposed.\n\nA majority of states currently tax MST using an ad valorem method, which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product, typically the wholesale price. This ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lower-priced products of equal weight. Altria supports legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on MST to a weight-based methodology because, unlike the ad valorem tax, a weight-based tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax. As of February 22, 2022, the federal government, 23 states, Puerto Rico, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Cook County, Illinois have adopted a weight-based tax methodology for MST.\n\nAn increasing number of states and localities also are imposing excise taxes on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouches. As of February 22, 2022, 30 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and a number of cities and counties have enacted legislation to tax e-vapor products. These taxes are calculated in varying ways and may differ based on the e-vapor product form. Similarly, 11 states and the District of Columbia have enacted legislation to tax oral nicotine pouches.\n\nTax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on product sales of Altria's tobacco operating companies and JUUL through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the non-premium or discount segments, to lower taxed tobacco products, or to counterfeit and contraband products. Lower sales volume and reported share performance of Altria's tobacco operating companies' and investees' products could have a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated financial position or earnings. In addition, substantial excise tax increases on e-vapor and oral nicotine products, may negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\n## International Treaty on Tobacco Control\n\nThe World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the 'FCTC') entered into force in February 2005. As of February 22, 2022, 181 countries, as well as the European Union, have become parties to the FCTC. While the United States is a signatory of the FCTC, it is not currently a party to the agreement, as the agreement has not been submitted to, or ratified by, the U.S. Senate. The FCTC is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. The treaty recommends (and in certain instances, requires) signatory nations to enact legislation that would address various tobacco-related issues.\n\nThere are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the FCTC, some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of tobacco products. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these",

Excluding a favorable currency impact of $0.12, diluted EPS increased by 10.7%.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019\n\nFor a discussion comparing our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, with the year ended December 31, 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Discussion and Analysis - Consolidated Operating Results in  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2021.\n\n## Operating Results by Business Segment\n\n## Business Environment\n\n## Taxes, Legislation, Regulation and Other Matters Regarding the Manufacture, Marketing, Sale and Use of Tobacco Products\n\nThe tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash  flows  and  financial  position.  These  challenges,  which  are  discussed  below  and  in  ' Cautionary  Factors  That  May  Affect  Future Results ,' include:\n\n- regulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other nicotinecontaining products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or even ban certain of our products;\n- fiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;\n- illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called 'illicit whites';\n- intense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;\n- pending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies ; and\n- governmental investigations.\n\nRegulatory  Restrictions: The  tobacco  industry  operates  in  a  highly  regulated  environment.  The  well-known  risks  of  smoking  have  led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.\n\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  (the  'FCTC')  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (the  \"WHO\"),  which  entered  into  force  in  2005.  The  FCTC  has  as  its  main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others.  The  FCTC  governing  body,  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  ('CoP'),  has  also  adopted  non-binding  guidelines  and  policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty. In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for  more  scientific  assessment  and  improved  reporting  to  define  policy  on  heated  tobacco  products.  Similar  to  its  previous  policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\n\nPrior to CoP 9 that took place in November 2021, the WHO and the WHO FCTC Secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products. The reports were noted by CoP 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to CoP 10, currently scheduled  for  2023.  It  is  not  possible  to  predict  whether  or  to  what  extent  measures  recommended  by  the  WHO's  reports  will  be implemented as the reports are not binding to the WHO Member States.\n\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today, but how fast, and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that recognize a significant difference on a risk continuum between combustible tobacco on the one hand and non-combustible tobacco and other nicotine-containing products on the other. Regulation should include measures that will accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such products to",

These risks could be heightened in light of increased pressure on our suppliers from supply chain challenges. In addition, if another company recalls or experiences negativ e publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their ov erall consumption of products in this category. Any of these ev ents could materially and adv ersely affect our reputation, brands, product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\n\nWe may also suffer losses when our products or operations or those of our suppliers v iolate applicable laws or regulations, or when our or our suppliers' products cause injury, illness or death.

Unresolved Staff Comments.\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 1C. Cybersecurity.\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe rely extensively on information technology, much of which is managed by third-party service providers (such as cloud data service providers), to support a variety of business processes and activities, including: complying with regulatory, legal, financial reporting and tax  requirements; engaging in marketing and ecommerce activities; managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations; researching, developing, manufacturing and distributing our products; collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information; and communicating with employees, investors, suppliers, trade customers, adult tobacco consumers and others. Recognizing the critical importance of cybersecurity in today's digital landscape, we are committed to safeguarding our information assets, protecting consumer data and maintaining the integrity and availability of our systems. Accordingly, we have implemented an extensive cybersecurity risk management framework designed to identify, assess, mitigate and prevent potential cybersecurity risks and to align with industry best practices and all applicable regulatory requirements. We leverage the National Institute of Standards and Technology ('NIST') Cybersecurity Framework and industry best practices to identify and prioritize cybersecurity risks based on their potential impacts. We also use the NIST framework and industry best practices to drive enhancements to our program that are designed to protect our assets and third-party partners. The NIST framework also helps us maintain ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements. We align our security standards for infrastructure configuration with the Center for Internet Security's Benchmarks, which are prescriptive recommendations based upon the consensus of global cybersecurity experts.\n\nOur framework is built around the following key principles: (i) risk assessment and threat intelligence; (ii) security controls; (iii) incident response; (iv) employee awareness and training; and (v) third-party risk management. We have integrated our cybersecurity framework into our broad enterprise risk management processes, which allows us to leverage our existing enterprise-wide experience in managing risk and adapting to change in the cybersecurity threat landscape.\n\n- Risk Assessment and Threat Intelligence: We conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats. Our Information Technology ('IT') Risk Management function, overseen by our Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO'), leads internal self-assessments, which involve evaluating the security posture of critical systems, networks and applications as well as the potential impact of cybersecurity threats on our business operations, financial condition and reputation. IT Risk Management also conducts ongoing threat monitoring and has implemented monitoring systems, including technologies such as intrusion detection systems, security information and event management tools and threat intelligence programs.\n\nWe regularly engage third-party consulting services to conduct audits and assessments of the effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls and processes and identify areas for improvement based on developments in industry best practices. We typically engage these services",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nmaterial non-cash impairment of our e-vapor reporting unit's goodwill or related definite-lived intangible assets (carrying value of $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2024), or both, in future periods. Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

      "answer": "Citibank serves as the administrative agent in PepsiCo's $1 billion 2023 Five-Year Credit Agreement, facilitating large-scale corporate financing for operational needs. In contrast, Citibank's co-branded credit card partnership with Costco focuses on consumer financial services, involving multiple amendments since 2015 to enhance customer engagement and loyalty.

      "answer": "In 2021, Coca-Cola's non-U.S. unit case volume was 71% attributable to sparkling soft drinks, with the Coca-Cola trademark representing 48% of that volume. This reflects a strong emphasis on carbonated beverages through bottlers like Coca-Cola HBC, which operates in the Czech Republic. In contrast, PM strategically launched the IQOS VEEV or VEEV brand in the Czech Republic in 2022, focusing on next-generation reduced-risk products (RRPs) rather than traditional beverages. While Coca-Cola\u2019s non-U.S. strategy centered on sparkling drinks, PM\u2019s Czech Republic initiative targeted nicotine delivery innovation, indicating divergent product mix priorities between the two companies in the region.",

('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

          "chunk_text": "current  and  anticipated  production  requirements.  However,  some  components  and  materials  necessary  for  the  production  of  our  RRPs, including those for the electronic devices, are obtained from single or limited sources, and can be subject to industry-wide shortages and price fluctuations. While we were successful in maintaining adequate supply of such components and materials so far, we may not be able to secure such supply going forward, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; this could negatively impact the commercialization of our RRPs.\n\nIn addition, we are also exposed to a world-wide shortage of semiconductors, which continues to put constraints on our device supplies for RRPs. We believe, however, that the overall impact of this shortage remains manageable, and we have adjusted our device assortments to limit the effect on consumer availability of our RRPs.\n\nWe discuss product warranties in more detail in Item 8, Note 5. Product Warranty . The significance of warranty claims is dependent on a number of factors, including device version mix, product failure rates, logistics and service delivery costs, and warranty policies, and may increase with the number of devices sold.\n\nProduct quality may affect consumer acceptance of our RRPs.\n\nOur near-term planned commercialization efforts for the other PMI-developed RRP platforms are as follows:\n\n- We started commercializing an improved version of our IQOS MESH product in Canada, Corsica, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Ukraine and New Zealand under the IQOS VEEV or VEEV brand names. We currently plan to launch this product in additional markets.\n- With respect to TEEPS , our Platform 2 product, we finalized our improvements to this product and conducted a consumer test in the last quarter of 2021. As a result of the feedback from this consumer test, the design of our current Platform 2 technology has been discontinued. We are assessing alternative designs for this consumer segment.\n- Following the consumer test conducted in 2020, and the results of the product use and adaptation study described above, we are incorporating our learnings into our plans to improve our Platform 3 product.\n- We launched  a  Platform  5  product  in  Sweden  in  January  2022,  that  is  a  reformulated  version  of  the  already  commercialized nicotine pouches bearing the Shiro brand by our newly acquired affiliate AG Snus.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of these commercialization efforts could be delayed.\n\nRRP Regulation and Taxation: RRPs contain nicotine and are not risk-free. As we describe in more detail above, we support science-based regulation and taxation of RRPs, and believe that regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present, are  likely  to  present,  or  have  the  potential  to  present  less  risk  of  harm  to  adult  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continued smoking and should recognize  a  continuum  of  risk  for  tobacco  and  other  nicotine-containing  products.  Regulation,  as  well  as  industry practices, should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form.\n\nSome governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotine-containing products such as our RRPs and communication of truthful and non-misleading information about such products.\n\nThese  regulations  might  foreclose  or  unreasonably  restrict  adult  consumer  access  even  to  products  that  might  be  shown  to  be  a  better consumer  choice  than  continuing  to  smoke.  During  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  some  governments  have  been  and  may  continue  to  be temporarily unable to focus on the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business.\n\nWe oppose blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking. By contrast, we support regulation that sets clear standards for all RRP categories and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke.\n\nIn the United States, an established regulatory framework for assessing 'Modified Risk Tobacco Products' and 'New Tobacco Products' exists  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  FDA.  We  submitted  to  the  FDA  a  Modified  Risk  Tobacco  Product Application  ('MRTPA')  for  our Platform 1 product in December 2016, and a Premarket Tobacco Product Application ('PMTA') for our Platform 1 product in March 2017.",

(the 'Parent'), has guaranteed the Parent's obligations under its outstanding debt securities, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program (the 'Guarantees'). Pursuant to the Guarantees, the Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor, the payment and performance of the Parent's obligations under the guaranteed debt instruments (the 'Obligations'), subject to release under certain customary circumstances as noted below.\n\nThe Guarantees provide that the Guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations. The liability of the Guarantor under the Guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of: any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto; any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations; or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Parent or the Guarantor.\n\nUnder applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law, the Guarantees could be voided, or claims in respect of the Guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the Guarantor, if, among other things, the Guarantor, at the time it incurred the Obligations evidenced by the Guarantees:\n\n- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor; and\n- either:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence;\n- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the Guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.\n\nIn addition, under such circumstances, the payment of amounts by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees could be voided and required to be returned to the Guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor, as the case may be.\n\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, the Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\n- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of its assets, all at a fair valuation;\n- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n- it could not pay its debts as they become due.\n\nTo the extent the Guarantees are voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of the guaranteed debt obligations would not have any claim against the Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Parent.\n\nThe obligations of the Guarantor under the Guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the Guarantees. For this purpose, 'Bankruptcy Law' means Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.\n\nThe Guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the Obligations upon the earliest to occur of:\n\n- the date, if any, on which the Guarantor consolidates with or merges into the Parent or any successor;\n- the date, if any, on which the Parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the Guarantor;\n- the payment in full of the Obligations pertaining to such Guarantees; and\n- the rating of the Parent's long-term senior unsecured debt by S&amp;P of A or higher.\n\nThe Parent is a holding company; therefore, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. Neither the Guarantor nor other 100% owned subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the debt ('Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries') are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.",

Through these processes, a manufacturer could receive (i) a 'not substantially equivalent' determination, (ii) a denial of a PMTA or (iii) a marketing order withdrawal by the FDA on one or more products, which would require the removal of the product or products from the market. Such actions could have a material adverse impact on the business and consolidated results of operations of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\nProvisional Products : Most cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by PM USA and USSTC are 'Provisional Products.' Altria's subsidiaries timely submitted SE reports for these Provisional Products. PM USA and USSTC have received SE determinations on certain Provisional Products. Those products that were found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent (certain smokeless tobacco products) had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the FDA's determinations; therefore, those determinations did not impact business results. PM USA and USSTC have other Provisional Products that continue to be subject to the FDA's pre-market review process. In the meantime, they can continue marketing these products unless the FDA determines that a specific Provisional Product is not substantially equivalent.\n\nIn addition, the FDA has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of Provisional Product SE reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further FDA review. PM USA and USSTC have Provisional Products included in this subset of products.\n\nWhile Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies believe their current Provisional Products meet the statutory requirements of the FSPTCA, they cannot predict how the FDA will ultimately apply law, regulation and guidance to their various SE reports. Should Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies receive unfavorable determinations on any SE reports currently pending with the FDA, they believe they can replace the vast majority of their respective product volumes with other FDA authorized products or with Grandfathered Products.\n\nNon-Provisional Products : Cigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after March 22, 2011 are 'Non-Provisional Products' and must receive a marketing order from the FDA prior to being offered for sale. Marketing orders for Non-Provisional Products may be obtained by filing an SE report, PMTA or using another pre-market pathway established by the FDA. Altria's cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies may not be able to obtain a marketing order for non-provisional products because the FDA may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval.\n\nProducts Regulated in 2016 : Manufacturers of products first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products, that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an SE report or PMTA by the filing deadline of September 9, 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market. These products can remain on the market during FDA review through court-allowed, case-by-case discretion, so long as the report or application was timely filed with the FDA. Due to the large number of applications received by September 9, 2020, the FDA did not complete its review of all submitted applications by September 9, 2021, although it represents that it has made decisions on more than 98% of the applications, with most being marketing denial orders and a few marketing granted orders for tobacco flavor e-vapor products. A number of the marketing denial orders are subject to litigation challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers. For those products still under FDA review, it is uncertain when and for how long the FDA may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its case-by-case discretion. For products (new or modified) not on the market as of August 8, 2016, manufacturers must file an SE report or PMTA and receive FDA authorization prior to marketing and selling the product.\n\nHelix submitted PMTAs for on! oral nicotine pouches in May 2020. JUUL submitted PMTAs to the FDA for its e-vapor device and the related tobacco and menthol flavors in July 2020. As of February 22, 2022, the FDA has not issued marketing order decisions for any on! or JUUL products. In addition, as of February 22, 2022, Middleton has received market orders or exemptions that cover over 99% of its cigar product volume.\n\nIn December 2013, Altria's subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with PMI, including an agreement that grants Altria an exclusive right to commercialize certain of PMI's heated tobacco products in the United States, subject to FDA authorization of the applicable products. PMI submitted a PMTA and a MRTP application with the FDA for its electronically heated tobacco products comprising the IQOS Tobacco Heating System . The IQOS devices heat, but do not burn tobacco. In April 2019, the FDA authorized the PMTA for the IQOS Tobacco Heating System and in July 2020, the FDA authorized the marketing of this system as a MRTP with a reduced exposure claim. In December 2020, the FDA authorized the PMTA for IQOS 3, an updated version of the IQOS devices. The MRTP authorization for the original IQOS device currently does not apply to the IQOS 3 device. PMI submitted an MRTP application for the IQOS 3 device in March 2021, which is currently under review by the FDA.\n\nIn September 2021, in connection with a patent dispute, the ITC issued a cease and desist order, effective as of November 29, 2021, banning (i) the importation of the IQOS devices, Marlboro HeatSticks and infringing components into the United States and (ii) the sale, marketing and distribution of such imported products in the United States.

In  the  fourth quarter of 2021, the IQOS device supply situation eased, resulting in an improved IQOS user growth versus the third quarter. We expect an improving IQOS device supply situation, with a gradual return to an unconstrained IQOS user quarterly growth progression. However, we still do not have full visibility over the full year 2022.\n\n## IQOS in the United States\n\nOn November 29, 2021, an importation ban and cease-and-desist orders imposed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") relating  to IQOS Platform  1  products  (including  consumables  and  infringing  components)  went  into  effect.  As  a  result, IQOS is  not currently available for sale in the U.S. We have appealed the patent and statutory issues related to the ITC's Final Determination, and also have contingency plans underway, including domestic production. We hope to be able to resume U.S. supply in the first half of 2023. For more details on the ITC case and related legal matters, please refer to Item 8, Note 17 . Contingencies .\n\nThe ITC decision has no bearing outside the U.S.; competitor lawsuits based on the same patent families have repeatedly and universally failed in European courts and the European Patent Office.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nDuring 2021, PMI acquired the following companies:\n\n- Vectura Group plc, an inhaled therapeutics company based in the United Kingdom;\n- Fertin  Pharma A/S,  a  Danish  company  that  is  a  leading  developer  and  manufacturer  of  innovative  pharmaceutical  and  well-being products based on oral and intra-oral delivery systems;\n- OtiTopic,  Inc.,  a  U.S.  respiratory  drug  development  company  with  a  late-stage  dry  powder  inhalation  aspirin  treatment  for  acute myocardial infarction; and\n- AG Snus Aktieselskab, a Danish company, and its Swedish subsidiary, Tobacco House of Sweden AB, fully owned by AG Snus, which operates in the oral tobacco and modern oral product categories.\n\nFor further details on these acquisitions, see Item 8, Note 6.

      "answer": "WMT has $37.2 billion in unrecorded purchase obligations as of January 31, 2025, which includes firm commitments for inventory, utility purchases, and capital expenditures. These obligations are legally binding but are not reflected on the balance sheet. However, according to DIS's 10-K filing, VAR models \u2014 like the one used by MDLZ \u2014 exclude forecasted transactions and firm commitments when estimating financial risk exposure. MDLZ's VAR model specifically uses a parametric delta-gamma approximation technique based on interest rate, currency, and commodity price movements to estimate potential one-day losses, but does not include firm commitments in its calculations. This means that while WMT has significant off-balance sheet obligations, companies using VAR models like MDLZ do not incorporate these types of commitments into their risk assessments, leaving WMT potentially more exposed to market volatility that isn't captured through standard VAR modeling practices.",

Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations. See Note 6 and Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, respectively.\n\nAs of January 31, 2025, the Company has $37.2 billion of unrecorded purchase obligations outstanding, of which $15.9 billion is due within one year. Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fix ed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fix ed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fix ed or minimum quantity, are ex cluded from the obligations quantified above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are also ex cluded as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.\n\n## Capital Resources\n\nWe believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.",

While various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation, the Company's computations are based on a variance/co-variance technique, which assesses the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company's debt, interest rate and foreign exchange, and commodities derivatives, and market sensitive equity investments.

      "question": "How does Coca-Cola's use of economic hedges for commodity price risk, with a total notional value of $908 million as of December 31, 2021, compare to Philip Morris's hedging activities for forecasted transactions, particularly in terms of accounting treatment and impact on earnings?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola uses economic hedges for commodity price risk with a notional value of $908 million as of December 31, 2021, and immediately recognizes changes in fair value in earnings within line items like cost of goods sold. In contrast, Philip Morris uses derivative contracts to hedge forecasted transactions and applies cash flow hedge accounting, where gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive losses until the hedged transactions affect earnings. This means KO\u2019s commodity hedge impact is recognized upfront in earnings, while PM delays recognition until the forecasted transactions occur, leading to different short-term earnings volatility profiles despite both managing exposure to external market fluctuations.",

The Company did not reclassify any gains or losses related to net investment hedges from AOCI into earnings during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. In addition, the Company did not have any ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The cash inflows and outflows associated with the Company's derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges are classified in the line item other investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## Economic (Non-Designated) Hedging Strategy\n\nIn addition to derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, the Company also uses certain derivatives as economic hedges of foreign currency, interest rate and commodity exposure. Although these derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in the fair values of economic hedges are immediately recognized in earnings.\n\nThe Company uses foreign currency economic hedges to offset the earnings impact that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies. The changes in the fair values of economic hedges used to offset those monetary assets and liabilities are immediately recognized in earnings in the line item other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income. In addition, we use foreign currency economic hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including those related to certain acquisition and divestiture activities. The changes in the fair values of economic hedges used to offset the variability in U.S. dollar net cash flows are immediately recognized in earnings in the line items net operating revenues, cost of goods sold or other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income, as applicable. The total notional values of derivatives related to our foreign currency economic hedges were $4,258 million and $5,727 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe Company uses interest rate contracts as economic hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. The total notional value of derivatives related to our economic hedges of this type was $200 million as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe Company also uses certain derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process and vehicle fuel. The changes in the fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized in earnings in the line items net operating revenues, cost of goods sold, or selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income, as applicable. The total notional values of derivatives related to our economic hedges of this type were $908 million and $715 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

Gains  and  losses  associated  with  qualifying  cash  flow  hedge  contracts  are  deferred  as  components  of  accumulated  other comprehensive  losses  until  the  underlying  hedged  transactions  are  reported  in  PMI's  consolidated  statements  of  earnings.  As  of December 31, 2021, PMI has hedged forecasted transactions for periods not exceeding the next twelve months, with the exception of one derivative  contract  that  expires  in  May  2024.  The  impact  of  these  hedges  is  primarily  included  in  operating  cash  flows  on  PMI's consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Fair Value Hedges\n\nPMI has entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts, designated as fair value hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate U.S. dollar-denominated debt that results from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. For derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized in current earnings. The carrying amount of the debt hedged, which includes the cumulative adjustment for fair value gains/losses, as of December 31, 2021 was $398 million, and is recorded in long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations\n\nPMI designates derivative contracts and certain foreign currency denominated debt instruments as net investment hedges, primarily of its Euro net assets. The amount of pre-tax gain/(loss) related to these debt instruments, that was reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive  losses  within  currency  translation  adjustment,  was  $278  million,  $(465)  million  and  $234  million,  for  the  years  ended December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  The  premiums  paid  for,  and  settlements  of,  net  investment  hedges  are  included  in investing cash flows on PMI's consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Other Derivatives\n\nPMI has entered  into  derivative  contracts  to  hedge  the  foreign  currency  exchange  and  interest  rate  risks  related  to  intercompany  loans between certain subsidiaries, and third-party loans. While effective as economic hedges, no hedge accounting is applied for these contracts; therefore, the gains (losses) relating to these contracts are reported in PMI's consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Qualifying Hedging Activities Reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses\n\nDerivative gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive losses are a result of qualifying hedging activity. Transfers of these gains  or  losses  to  earnings  are  offset  by  the  corresponding  gains  or  losses  on  the  underlying  hedged  item.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Discussion and Analysis - Consolidated Operating Results in  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2021.\n\n## Operating Results by Business Segment\n\n## Business Environment\n\n## Taxes, Legislation, Regulation and Other Matters Regarding the Manufacture, Marketing, Sale and Use of Tobacco Products\n\nThe tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash  flows  and  financial  position.  These  challenges,  which  are  discussed  below  and  in  ' Cautionary  Factors  That  May  Affect  Future Results ,' include:\n\n- regulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other nicotinecontaining products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or even ban certain of our products;\n- fiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;\n- illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called 'illicit whites';\n- intense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;\n- pending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies ; and\n- governmental investigations.\n\nRegulatory  Restrictions: The  tobacco  industry  operates  in  a  highly  regulated  environment.  The  well-known  risks  of  smoking  have  led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.\n\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  (the  'FCTC')  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (the  \"WHO\"),  which  entered  into  force  in  2005.  The  FCTC  has  as  its  main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others.  The  FCTC  governing  body,  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  ('CoP'),  has  also  adopted  non-binding  guidelines  and  policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty. In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for  more  scientific  assessment  and  improved  reporting  to  define  policy  on  heated  tobacco  products.  Similar  to  its  previous  policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\n\nPrior to CoP 9 that took place in November 2021, the WHO and the WHO FCTC Secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products. The reports were noted by CoP 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to CoP 10, currently scheduled  for  2023.  It  is  not  possible  to  predict  whether  or  to  what  extent  measures  recommended  by  the  WHO's  reports  will  be implemented as the reports are not binding to the WHO Member States.\n\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today, but how fast, and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that recognize a significant difference on a risk continuum between combustible tobacco on the one hand and non-combustible tobacco and other nicotine-containing products on the other. Regulation should include measures that will accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such products to",

Beverage volume also includes volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks sold by our noncontrolled affiliates. Concentrate volume sold  to  independent  bottlers  is  reported  in  concentrate  shipments  and  equivalents  (CSE),  whereas finished  beverage  product  volume  is  reported  in  bottler  case  sales  (BCS).  Both  CSE  and  BCS  convert  all beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. Typically, CSE and BCS are not equal in any given period due to seasonality, timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. While our net  revenue is  not  entirely  based  on  BCS  volume  due  to  the  independent  bottlers  in  our  supply  chain,  we believe that BCS is a better measure of the consumption of our beverage products. PBNA, LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell  ready-to-drink  tea  products  through  a  joint  venture  with  Unilever  (under  the  Lipton  brand  name),  and PBNA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells readyto-drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks. In addition, APAC licenses the Tropicana brand for use in China on co-branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance with Tingyi.\n\nConvenient food volume includes volume sold by our subsidiaries and noncontrolled affiliates of convenient food products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks. Internationally, we measure convenient food product  volume  in  kilograms,  while  in  North  America  we  measure  convenient  food  product  volume  in pounds.  FLNA  makes,  markets,  distributes  and  sells  Sabra  refrigerated  dips  and  spreads  through  a  joint venture with Strauss Group.\n\n## Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit\n\n",

      "answer": "PM values its derivative contracts using standard valuation models based on readily observable market inputs such as foreign exchange spot rates, interest rate differentials, and maturity dates. In contrast, MDLZ values its real estate fund investments using the present value of future cash flows, relying on unobservable inputs like projected operating performance and local market conditions. While PM's approach falls under Level 1 or 2 fair value measurements due to the use of observable data, MDLZ's real estate fund valuations are categorized as Level 3 due to the reliance on unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by market data.",

      "answer": "PEP estimates the fair value of brand assets using assumptions that include the impact of a high interest rate environment on future cash flows and discount rates. This approach increases sensitivity to interest rate changes, especially for intangible assets with long-duration cash flows. PG, in contrast, uses RiskMetrics\u2122 data and value-at-risk modeling to assess derivative positions, assuming normal financial returns and incorporating diversification benefits. The difference in valuation methods\u2014discounted cash flow for PEP's brand assets versus statistical modeling for PG's derivatives\u2014results in PEP being more directly sensitive to rising discount rates, while PG's exposures are moderated by correlation and diversification assumptions in their models. This distinction in how market volatility is incorporated affects how each company's balance sheet reflects interest rate risk in their respective asset valuations.",

The sensitivity of our derivatives to these m arket fluctuations is discussed below . See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statem ents for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is im pacted by changes in m arket conditions, including interest rates and inflationary , deflationary and recessionary conditions.

At the end of 2024, the potential change in fair value of com m odity derivative contracts, assum ing a 10% decrease in the underlying com m odity price, would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2024 by $140 m illion, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying com m odity purchases.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nOur operations outside of the United States generated 44% of our consolidated net revenue in 2024, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil, collectively , com prising approxim ately 25% of our consolidated net revenue in 2024.

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material, as it is the Company's policy to contract only with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, sourcing strategies, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company's treasury and risk management policies, which prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose. It is the Company's policy to enter into derivative instrument contracts with terms that match the underlying exposure being hedged. Provided below are details of the Company's exposures by type of risk and derivative instruments by type of hedge designation.\n\n## Valuation Considerations\n\nThe Company's derivative instruments include foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts. The fair value of these instruments are classified as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements.\n\nThe Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates (Level 2 valuation).\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company utilizes forward-starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rates for future debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates (Level 2 valuation).",

Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products; the sale of tobacco products in the United States that are intended for sale outside the country; the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the Internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes; and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another. Counterfeit tobacco products, for example, are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments. Counterfeit versions of our tobacco operating companies' and investees' products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands. Illicit trade in tobacco products also harms law-abiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees have made in legitimate distribution channels. Moreover, illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal, state and local governments losing tax revenues. Losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions, including increasing excise taxes; imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact Altria's consolidated results of operations and cash flows, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL, and the businesses of its tobacco operating companies and investees; or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold.\n\nAltria's tobacco operating companies communicate with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities, enforce wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products and, when necessary, litigate to protect their trademarks.\n\n## Price, Availability and Quality of Tobacco, Other Raw Materials, Ingredients and Component Parts\n\nShifts in crops (such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns), government restrictions and mandated prices, production control programs, economic trade sanctions, import duties and tariffs, international trade disruptions, inflation, geopolitical instability, climate and environmental changes and disruptions due to man-made or natural disasters may increase the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco or other raw materials or ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our companies' and our investees' products. Any significant change in the price, availability or quality of tobacco, other raw materials, ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our products and those of our investees could restrict our tobacco operating companies' and investees' ability to continue manufacturing and marketing existing products or impact adult consumer product acceptability and adversely affect our tobacco operating companies' and investees' profitability and businesses.\n\nWith respect to tobacco, as with other agricultural commodities, crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. Additionally, the price and availability of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand. Economic conditions, including inflation and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, are unpredictable, which, among other factors, may result in changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production which could negatively impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply. In addition, as consumer demand increases for smoke-free products and decreases for combustible products, the volume of tobacco leaf required for production may decrease. The reduced demand for tobacco leaf may result in the reduced supply and availability of domestic tobacco as growers divert resources to other crops, which could result in increased costs to our tobacco operating companies.\n\nTobacco production in certain countries also is subject to a variety of controls, including government-mandated prices and production control programs.  Moreover, certain types of tobacco are only available in limited geographies, including geographies experiencing political instability or government prohibitions on the import or export of tobacco, and loss of their availability could impair our subsidiaries' ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also may limit access to and increase the cost of raw materials, component parts and personal protective equipment as United States and global suppliers may temporarily shut down facilities or use different production schedules with lower productivity in order to address exposure to the virus or as a result of a government mandate. In addition, (i) current labor market dynamics indicate labor shortages, with employers in a number of industries having difficulty employing workers and (ii) supply chain dynamics reflect failures and delays resulting from various issues including labor shortages, logistical problems and weather-related incidents. These labor shortages and supply failures and delays have led to certain increases in raw material (for example, resins used in our packaging), ingredient and component part prices and may lead to supply chain disruptions; however, to date, the impact on our operating companies and investees has been immaterial. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, labor market dynamics and supply chain disruptions outlined above may continue, which could adversely affect our subsidiaries' and investees' profitability and businesses. Recent economic conditions reflect an increased rate of inflation. To date, higher inflation has not had a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability. Although Altria anticipates inflation will continue at elevated levels in 2022, it is not expected to have a material impact on our or our investees' businesses, revenues or profitability.\n\nIn addition, government taxes, restrictions and prohibitions on the sale and use of certain products may limit access to, and increase the costs of, raw materials and component parts and, potentially, impede our ability to sell certain of our products.

      "question": "How does the difference in vesting timelines for RSU awards between PM and WMT affect the recognition period of compensation costs, given PM's $160 million in unrecognized RSU costs and WMT's shift from 25% annual vesting to 8% quarterly vesting?",
      "answer": "PM has $160 million in unrecognized compensation costs from non-vested RSU awards, which are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of seventeen months, typically over three years or upon specific events like death, disability, or reaching age 58. This vesting schedule aligns with PM's policy where RSU awards generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. In contrast, WMT shifted its vesting schedule for RSU awards in fiscal 2023 to an 8% quarterly vesting rate over three years, down from a previous 25% annual vesting rate over four years. This change in WMT's vesting schedule accelerates the recognition of compensation costs earlier in the vesting period compared to PM\u2019s structure. As a result, WMT\u2019s updated vesting approach leads to a more evenly distributed cost recognition over the three-year period, whereas PM's cost recognition is more back-loaded due to its cliff-vesting structure tied to specific events or the three-year anniversary.",

The distribution system  used depends on custom er needs, product characteristics and local trade practices.\n\n## Direct-Store-Delivery\n\nWe, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD system s that deliver beverages and convenient foods directly to retail stores where the products are m erchandised by our em ployees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to m erchandise with m axim um  visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store prom otion and m erchandising.\n\n## Customer Warehouse\n\nSome of our products are delivered from  our m anufacturing plants and distribution centers, both com pany and third-party operated, to custom er warehouses. These less costly system s generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover.\n\n## Distributor Networks\n\nWe distribute m any of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach  can  be  achieved  by  including  a  wide  range  of  products  on  the  delivery  vehicles.  For  exam ple,  our  foodservice  and  vending  business distri butes  beverages  and  convenient  foods  to  restaurants,  businesses,  schools  and  stadium s  through  third-party  foodservice  and  vending distri butors and operators.\n\n## E-commerce\n\nOur products are also available and sold directly to consum ers on a growing num ber of com pany-owned and third-party e-com m erce websites and mobile commerce applications.\n\n## Ingredients and Other Supplies\n\nThe principal ingredients we use in our beverage and convenient food products are acesulfam e potassium , aspartam e, corn, corn sweeteners, fl av ori n g s, f l ou r , ju i ce con cen trates, n u ts, oats, potatoes, raw m i l k, ri ce, seasoni ngs, sucral ose, sugar , vegetabl e and essenti al  oi l s, and wheat.

We included expanded footnote disclosures as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2023-07 in Note 17. Segment Reporting . We will include interim disclosure requirements in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements beginning in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n## Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. We record cash equivalents at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.\n- Depreciation, Amortization and Impairment Testing: We record property, plant and equipment at historical costs and depreciate by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate machinery and equipment over periods up to 20 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years. We amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years.\n\nWe review long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If we determine that an impairment ex ists, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. We base impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. We also review the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.\n\nWe conduct a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment as of October 1 of each year, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require us to perform an interim review. We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If necessary, we will perform a single step quantitative impairment test. Additionally, we have the option to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, goodwill is considered impaired. We measure the amount of impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a reporting unit; however, the amount of the impairment loss is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset ex ceeds its fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows, we consider the intangible asset impaired and reduce the carrying value to fair value in the period identified.\n\n- Derivative Financial Instruments: From time to time, we enter into derivatives to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks, including foreign currency exchange rate risk. We use various types of derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, options and swaps.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities. We designate derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges at the inception of the contracts. For fair value hedges, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative, as well as the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item, in the consolidated statements of earnings each period. For cash flow hedges, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative each period in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) and reclassify changes to the consolidated statements of earnings in the same periods in which operating results are affected by the respective hedged item. For net investment hedges, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign currency transaction gains or losses on a nonderivative hedging instrument in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. Such amounts remain in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the underlying foreign operations occurs for investments in foreign entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We classify cash flows from hedging instruments in the same manner as the respective hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, is expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated. We formally designate and document, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective, the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction and method for assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions, if it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, we would no longer consider the hedge effective and would record all of the derivative gains and losses in the consolidated statement of earnings in the current period.\n\nFor financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments or do not qualify for hedge accounting, we record changes in fair value in the consolidated statement of earnings each period. We do not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.",

The increase in purchases of beverage products in 2021 was primarily due to increased purchases of Monster products as a result of international expansion and category growth.\n\nThe following table presents the difference between calculated fair value, based on quoted closing prices of publicly traded shares, and our Company's carrying value in investments in publicly traded companies accounted for under the equity method (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "represented 17 percent of the Company's worldwide unit case volume. Of the U.S. unit case volume, 61 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 42 percent of U.S. unit case volume. Unit case volume outside the United States represented 83 percent of the Company's worldwide unit case volume in 2021. The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 48 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\n\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

          "chunk_text": "As of December 31, 2021, there were 3 label-related cases brought by individual plaintiffs in Italy (1) and Chile (2) pending against our subsidiaries, compared with 5 such cases on December 31, 2020, and 5 such cases on December 31, 2019.\n\nPublic Civil Actions: Claims have been filed either by an individual, or a public or private entity, seeking to protect collective or individual rights, such as the right to health, the right to information or the right to safety. Plaintiffs' allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including product defect, concealment, and misrepresentation. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief including injunctive relief such as banning cigarettes, descriptors, smoking in certain places and advertising, as well as implementing communication campaigns and reimbursement of medical expenses incurred by public or private institutions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, there was 1 public civil action pending against our subsidiary in Venezuela (1), compared with 2 such cases on December 31, 2020, and 2 such cases on December 31, 2019.\n\nIn  a  public  civil  action  in  Venezuela, Federation  of  Consumers  and  Users  Associations  ('FEVACU'),  et  al.  v.  National  Assembly  of Venezuela and the Venezuelan Ministry of Health, Constitutional Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court , filed April 29, 2008, we were not named as a defendant, but the plaintiffs published a notice pursuant to court order, notifying all interested parties to appear in the case. In January 2009, our subsidiary appeared in the case in response to this notice. The plaintiffs purport to represent the right to health of the citizens of Venezuela and claim that the government failed to protect adequately its citizens' right to health. The claim asks the court to order the government to enact stricter regulations on the manufacture and sale of tobacco products. In addition, the plaintiffs ask the court to order companies involved in the tobacco industry to allocate a percentage of their 'sales or benefits' to establish a fund to pay for the health care costs of treating smoking-related diseases. In October 2008, the court ruled that plaintiffs have standing to file the claim and that the claim  meets  the  threshold  admissibility  requirements.  In  December  2012,  the  court  admitted  our  subsidiary  and  BAT's  subsidiary  as interested third parties. In February 2013, our subsidiary answered the complaint.\n\n## Reduced-Risk Products\n\nIn  Colombia,  an  individual  filed  a  purported  class  action, Ana Ferrero Rebolledo v. Philip Morris Colombia S.A., et al. ,  in April  2019 against  our  subsidiaries  with  the  Civil  Court  of  Bogota  related  to  the  marketing  of  our  Platform  1  product.  Plaintiff  alleged  that  our subsidiaries advertise the product in contravention of law and in a manner that misleads consumers by portraying the product in a positive light, and further asserts that the Platform 1 vapor contains many toxic compounds, creates a high level of dependence, and has damaging second-hand effects. Plaintiff sought injunctive relief and damages on her behalf and on a behalf of two classes (class 1 - all Platform 1 consumers in Colombia who seek damages for the purchase price of the product and personal injuries related to the alleged addiction, and class 2 - all residents of the neighborhood where the advertising allegedly took place who seek damages for exposure to the alleged illegal advertising). Our subsidiaries answered the complaint in January 2020, and in February 2020, plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint modifies the relief sought on behalf of the named plaintiff and on behalf of a single class (all consumers of Platform 1 products in Colombia who seek damages for the product purchase price and personal injuries related to the use of an allegedly harmful product). In June 2021, our subsidiaries answered the amended complaint.\n\n## Other Litigation\n\nThe Department of Special Investigations of the government of Thailand (\"DSI\") conducted an investigation into alleged underpayment by our  subsidiary,  Philip  Morris  (Thailand)  Limited  (\"PM  Thailand\"),  of  customs  duties  and  excise  taxes  relating  to  imports  from  the Philippines  covering  the  period  2003-2007.  On  January  18,  2016,  the  Public  Prosecutor  filed  charges  against  our  subsidiary  and  seven former and current employees in the Bangkok Criminal Court alleging that PM Thailand and the individual defendants jointly and with the intention to defraud the Thai government, under-declared import prices of cigarettes to avoid full payment of taxes and duties in connection with import entries of cigarettes from the Philippines during the period of July 2003 to June 2006. The government is seeking a fine of approximately THB 80.8 billion (approximately $2.4 billion). In May 2017, Thailand enacted a new customs act. The new act, which took effect in November 2017, substantially limits the amount of fines that Thailand could seek in these proceedings. PM Thailand believes that its declared import prices are in compliance with the Customs Valuation Agreement of the World Trade Organization and Thai law and that the allegations of the Public Prosecutor are inconsistent with several decisions already taken by Thai Customs and other Thai governmental agencies.  Trial  in  the  case  began  in  November  2017  and  concluded  in  September  2019.  In  November  2019,  the  trial  court  found  our subsidiary guilty of under-declaration of the prices and imposed a fine of approximately THB 1.2 billion (approximately $36 million). The trial court dismissed all charges against the individual defendants. In December 2019, as required by the Thai law, our subsidiary paid the fine. This payment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the period of payment. Our subsidiary filed an appeal of the trial court's decision. In addition, the Public Prosecutor filed an appeal of the trial court's decision challenging the dismissal of charges against the individual defendants and the amount of the fine imposed. If our subsidiary ultimately prevails on appeal, then Thailand will be required to return this payment to our subsidiary. The appellate court is scheduled to issue its decision on the appeals on June 1, 2022.",

In contrast, COST disclosed that it held no Level 1 or Level 3 financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of August 28, 2022, indicating no direct exposure to exchange-traded commodity futures like those used by MDLZ.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe use a combination of primarily currency forward contracts, futures, options and swaps; commodity forward contracts, futures and options; and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our asset derivatives is recorded within other current assets and other assets and the fair value of our liability derivatives is recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Non-cash changes in unrealized gains and losses related to our unsettled derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items, net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated, and those that are economic hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Currency movements related to our non-U.S. debt and our net investments in non-U.S. operations, as well as the related deferred taxes, are recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.\n\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.\n\nCommodity derivatives . We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nCurrency exchange derivatives . We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.

The fair value of these instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges.\n\nLevel 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of over-the-counter ('OTC') currency exchange forwards, options and swaps; commodity forwards and options; net investment hedge contracts; and interest rate swaps. Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our bifurcated exchange options are valued, as derivative instrument liabilities, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related to the market price of the underlying note and associated credit spread combined with the share of price, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility of the JDE Peet's shares over the life of the option. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our derivative contracts do not have a legal right of set-off. We manage the credit risk in connection with these and all our derivatives by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.",

The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain events, the holder has the right to require the Company to purchase this security at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued  and  unpaid  interest  to  the  date  of  the  event.  Interest  on  all  outstanding  long-term  debt  is  payable  semiannually.

The fair value of these instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges.\n\nLevel 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of over-the-counter ('OTC') currency exchange forwards, options and swaps; commodity forwards and options; net investment hedge contracts; and interest rate swaps. Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our bifurcated exchange options are valued, as derivative instrument liabilities, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related to the market price of the underlying note and associated credit spread combined with the share of price, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility of the JDE Peet's shares over the life of the option. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our derivative contracts do not have a legal right of set-off. We manage the credit risk in connection with these and all our derivatives by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.",

In contrast, CL's stock options typically vest ratably over three years, with a contractual term of eight years for options granted since 2019.

          "chunk_text": "FDA actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments.\n\nOn  September  29,  2021,  the  International  Trade  Commission  (\"ITC\")  issued  its  Final  Determination  (\"FD\"),  Limited  Exclusion  Order (\"LEO\") and Cease and Desist Order (\"CDO\"). The ITC upheld the finding of infringement in the ID and found a subsequent violation. The ITC issued a LEO prohibiting the importation of infringing tobacco heating articles and components thereof and cease and desist orders against Philip Morris USA, Inc. and Altria Client Services, LLC, which went into effect at the end of the 60-day Presidential review period on November 28, 2021. We have appealed the patent issues. Furthermore, lawsuits based on the same patent families have been repeatedly and universally rejected in European courts and the European Patent Office. The decision has no bearing outside the United States.\n\nUntil  recently,  there  were  no  countries  with  specific  product  standards  for  heat-not-burn  products.  Currently,  national  standards  setting minimum  quality  and  safety  requirements  for  such  products  have  been  adopted  in  several  countries  with  technical  heat-not-burn specifications and/or methods for demonstrating the absence of combustion. They are mandatory in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, the UAE, Uzbekistan and Bahrain, and voluntary in Armenia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Vietnam, the  U.K.  and  Ukraine.  In  Japan,  a  voluntary  standard  sets  minimum  safety  requirements  for  tobacco  heating  devices.  We  expect  other governments to consider similar product standards and encourage making them mandatory.\n\nAll EU member states have transposed the EU Tobacco Products Directive, including the provisions on novel tobacco products, such as heated  tobacco  units,  and  e-cigarettes.  Most  of  the  EU  member  states  require  a  notification  submitted  six  months  before  the  intended placing on the market of such products, while some require pre-market authorizations for the introduction of such products. To date, we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of our Platform 1 product in over 20 member states.\n\nIn addition, in Italy, in April 2018, we submitted an application for HEETS , used with the IQOS device, requesting regulatory recognition of the  reduction  of  toxic  substances  and  potential  risk  reduction  resulting  from  switching  to  this  product  compared  to  continued  cigarette smoking. In January 2019, our application was not granted primarily on the grounds of insufficient data and questions of methodology.  Due to the constraints of the review process, we had been unable to supplement the application with all the data we subsequently filed with the FDA and to address methodological questions during the review. We plan to submit a new application where we will clarify the concerns raised by the decision and further strengthen our application by submitting additional evidence that became available since we submitted our first application, consistent with our FDA filings. We are confident that our evidence supports our application.\n\nOn October 31, 2019, our Australian subsidiary, Philip Morris Limited ('PML'), submitted an application to the Scheduling Committee of the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia ('TGA') seeking to exempt heated tobacco products from being prohibited in Australia. In August 2020, the TGA issued its decision denying the application and stating that it did not present compelling evidence to establish a public health benefit from greater access to nicotine in heated tobacco products.\n\nTo date, several governmental agencies have published their scientific findings that analyze the harm-reduction potential of certain RRPs versus continuing smoking, including:\n\nIn December 2017, at the request of the U.K. Department of Health and Public Health England, the U.K. Committee on Toxicity published its assessment of the risk of heat-not-burn products relative to cigarette smoking. This assessment included analysis of scientific data for two  heat-not-burn  products,  one  of  which  was  our  Platform  1  product.  The  assessment  concluded  that,  while  still  harmful  to  health, compared with the known risks from cigarettes, heat-not-burn products are probably less harmful. Subsequently, in February 2018, Public Health England published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heat-not-burn products may be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than e-cigarettes.\n\nIn May 2018, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment ('BfR') published a study on the Platform 1 aerosol relative to cigarette smoke using the Health Canada Intense Smoking Regimen. BfR found reductions in selected HPHCs in a range of 80-99%. This publication indicates that significant reductions in the levels of selected toxicants are likely to reduce toxicant exposure, which BfR stated might be regarded as a discrete benefit compared to combustible cigarettes.\n\nIn May 2018, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment ('RIVM') published a factsheet on novel tobacco products that heat rather than burn tobacco, focusing on our Platform 1 product. RIVM analyzed the aerosol generated by our Platform 1 product and concluded that the use of this product, while still harmful to health, is probably less harmful than continued smoking.",

      "answer": "Both MDLZ and PM use a VAR model that assumes normal market conditions and applies a 95% confidence interval with a one-day holding period. However, MDLZ observes interest rate, currency exchange, and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for point-in-time VAR calculations and over each of the four prior quarters for average VAR amounts. Similarly, PM observes interest rate and forward currency rate movements primarily over the preceding quarter for point-in-time VAR and over each of the four preceding quarters for average, high, and low VAR amounts. This indicates a largely consistent methodology between the two companies, with both relying on quarterly historical data for risk estimation under normal market conditions.",

        "Hop 1: MDLZ \u2192 VAR Model: MDLZ uses a parametric delta-gamma approximation technique to estimate VAR for interest rates, currencies, and commodities, observing movements over the prior quarter for point-in-time calculations and four prior quarters for average amounts.",

Organic sales in Asia Pacific increased 3.0% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by India and the Greater China region.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was primarily due to an increase in Oral Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was driven by organic sales growth in the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories.\n\nOperating profit in Asia Pacific increased 9% in 2021 to $844, or 80 bps to 29.4% of Net sales. This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due primarily to an increase in Gross profit (50 bps) and a decrease in Other (income) expense, net (40 bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was primarily due to cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (230 bps), mix (20 bps) and other, partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs (230 bps). The decrease in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to a gain on an investment.",

PM USA is the largest cigarette company in the U.S., producing 76.3 billion cigarette units in 2023.

In contrast, Philip Morris submitted a Premarket Tobacco Product Application (PMTA) in March 2017 for its Platform 1 Reduced-Risk Product (RRP), indicating a more proactive approach to obtaining market authorization for new products. These differing strategies reflect how each company navigates FDA regulation: Altria focuses on maintaining existing product lines with minimal regulatory friction, while Philip Morris invests in the formal approval process for innovative products aimed at reducing harm compared to traditional cigarettes.",

The FDA also may request comments on broad topics through an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ('ANPRM'). Altria's tobacco operating companies actively engage with the FDA to develop and implement the FSPTCA's regulatory framework, including submission of comments to various FDA policies and proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions.\n\nThe FDA's implementation of the FSPTCA and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by United States states, territories and localities of their laws and regulations as well as of the State Settlement Agreements discussed below (see State Settlement Agreements below).  Such enforcement efforts may adversely affect the ability of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees to market and sell regulated tobacco products in those states, territories and localities.\n\n- FDA's Comprehensive Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation: In July 2017, the FDA announced a 'Comprehensive Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation' ('Comprehensive Plan') designed to strike a balance between regulation and encouraging the development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes. Since then, the FDA has issued additional information about its Comprehensive Plan in response to concerns associated with the rise in the use of e-vapor products by youth and the potential youth appeal of flavored tobacco products (see Underage Access and Use of Certain Tobacco Products below). As part of the Comprehensive Plan, the FDA:\n- issued ANPRMs relating to potential product standards for nicotine in cigarettes, flavors in all tobacco products (including menthol in cigarettes and characterizing flavors in all cigars) and, for e-vapor products, to protect against known public health risks such as concerns about youth exposure to liquid nicotine;\n- took actions to restrict youth access to e-vapor products; and\n- reconsidered the processes used by the FDA to review certain reports and new product applications.\n- Pre-Market Review Pathways for Tobacco Products and Market Authorization Enforcement: The FSPTCA permits the sale of tobacco products on the market as of February 15, 2007 and not subsequently modified ('Grandfathered Products') and new or modified products authorized through the PMTA, Substantial Equivalence ('SE') or SE Exemption pathways. Subsequent FDA rules also provide a Supplemental PMTA pathway designed to increase the efficiency of submission and review for modified versions of previously authorized products.\n\nThe FDA pre-market authorization enforcement policy varies based on product type and date of availability in the market, specifically:\n\n- Grandfathered Products are exempt from the pre-market authorization requirement;\n- cigarette and smokeless tobacco products that were modified or first introduced into the market between February 15, 2007 and March 22, 2011 are generally considered 'Provisional Products' for which SE reports were required to be filed by March 22, 2011. These reports must demonstrate that the product has the same characteristics as a product on the market as of February 15, 2007 or to a product previously determined to be substantially equivalent, or has different characteristics but does not raise different questions of public health; and\n- tobacco products that were first regulated by the FDA in 2016, including cigars, e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches that are not Grandfathered Products, are generally products for which either an SE report or PMTA needed to be filed by September 9, 2020.",

However,  some  components  and  materials  necessary  for  the  production  of  our  RRPs, including those for the electronic devices, are obtained from single or limited sources, and can be subject to industry-wide shortages and price fluctuations. While we were successful in maintaining adequate supply of such components and materials so far, we may not be able to secure such supply going forward, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; this could negatively impact the commercialization of our RRPs.\n\nIn addition, we are also exposed to a world-wide shortage of semiconductors, which continues to put constraints on our device supplies for RRPs. We believe, however, that the overall impact of this shortage remains manageable, and we have adjusted our device assortments to limit the effect on consumer availability of our RRPs.\n\nWe discuss product warranties in more detail in Item 8, Note 5. Product Warranty . The significance of warranty claims is dependent on a number of factors, including device version mix, product failure rates, logistics and service delivery costs, and warranty policies, and may increase with the number of devices sold.\n\nProduct quality may affect consumer acceptance of our RRPs.\n\nOur near-term planned commercialization efforts for the other PMI-developed RRP platforms are as follows:\n\n- We started commercializing an improved version of our IQOS MESH product in Canada, Corsica, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Ukraine and New Zealand under the IQOS VEEV or VEEV brand names. We currently plan to launch this product in additional markets.\n- With respect to TEEPS , our Platform 2 product, we finalized our improvements to this product and conducted a consumer test in the last quarter of 2021. As a result of the feedback from this consumer test, the design of our current Platform 2 technology has been discontinued. We are assessing alternative designs for this consumer segment.\n- Following the consumer test conducted in 2020, and the results of the product use and adaptation study described above, we are incorporating our learnings into our plans to improve our Platform 3 product.\n- We launched  a  Platform  5  product  in  Sweden  in  January  2022,  that  is  a  reformulated  version  of  the  already  commercialized nicotine pouches bearing the Shiro brand by our newly acquired affiliate AG Snus.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of these commercialization efforts could be delayed.\n\nRRP Regulation and Taxation: RRPs contain nicotine and are not risk-free. As we describe in more detail above, we support science-based regulation and taxation of RRPs, and believe that regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present, are  likely  to  present,  or  have  the  potential  to  present  less  risk  of  harm  to  adult  smokers  who  switch  to  these  products  versus  continued smoking and should recognize  a  continuum  of  risk  for  tobacco  and  other  nicotine-containing  products.  Regulation,  as  well  as  industry practices, should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form.\n\nSome governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotine-containing products such as our RRPs and communication of truthful and non-misleading information about such products.\n\nThese  regulations  might  foreclose  or  unreasonably  restrict  adult  consumer  access  even  to  products  that  might  be  shown  to  be  a  better consumer  choice  than  continuing  to  smoke.  During  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  some  governments  have  been  and  may  continue  to  be temporarily unable to focus on the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business.\n\nWe oppose blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking. By contrast, we support regulation that sets clear standards for all RRP categories and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke.\n\nIn the United States, an established regulatory framework for assessing 'Modified Risk Tobacco Products' and 'New Tobacco Products' exists  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  FDA.  We  submitted  to  the  FDA  a  Modified  Risk  Tobacco  Product Application  ('MRTPA')  for  our Platform 1 product in December 2016, and a Premarket Tobacco Product Application ('PMTA') for our Platform 1 product in March 2017.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive utilizes option contracts as part of its foreign exchange risk management strategy, hedging portions of its foreign currency purchases and firm commitments with contracts valued using observable market rates, aiming to minimize earnings volatility from currency fluctuations. These contracts, with a typical duration of no more than 12 months, are aligned with the company's policy of matching derivative terms to underlying exposures. In contrast, Walmart reports $37.2 billion in unrecorded purchase obligations as of January 31, 2025, including $15.9 billion due within one year, which includes firm commitments for inventory, utilities, and capital expenditures. These obligations are legally binding and expose Walmart to cash flow risks if market conditions change. The impact of Colgate's use of option contracts is to stabilize the U.S. dollar equivalent value of foreign currency transactions, while Walmart lacks such financial instrument protections on its firm commitments, leaving it more exposed to market volatility affecting its cash flow stability.",

Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material, as it is the Company's policy to contract only with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, sourcing strategies, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company's treasury and risk management policies, which prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose. It is the Company's policy to enter into derivative instrument contracts with terms that match the underlying exposure being hedged. Provided below are details of the Company's exposures by type of risk and derivative instruments by type of hedge designation.\n\n## Valuation Considerations\n\nThe Company's derivative instruments include foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts. The fair value of these instruments are classified as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements.\n\nThe Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates (Level 2 valuation).\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company utilizes forward-starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rates for future debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates (Level 2 valuation).",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions.

See Note 6 and Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, respectively.\n\nAs of January 31, 2025, the Company has $37.2 billion of unrecorded purchase obligations outstanding, of which $15.9 billion is due within one year. Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fix ed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fix ed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fix ed or minimum quantity, are ex cluded from the obligations quantified above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are also ex cluded as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.

      "answer": "Altria acknowledges in its 2022 10-K that while the U.S. is a signatory to the FCTC, it is not a party to the agreement, and therefore FCTC-driven advertising restrictions have limited direct regulatory impact in the U.S. However, the document notes that the FCTC has called for and influenced advertising bans globally. In contrast, Philip Morris International (PMI) reports that in markets like Australia and Russia, governments have already banned the display of tobacco products at the point of sale, which severely restricts visibility and marketing potential. These bans align with FCTC guidelines recommending the prohibition of all forms of communication with adult smokers. Given that Altria's primary market remains the U.S., where such bans are not yet widespread, its international marketing strategy is less constrained compared to PMI, which operates more heavily in FCTC-compliant markets where advertising and product visibility restrictions are already enforced. This divergence suggests that PMI must adapt more aggressively to restrictive advertising environments, while Altria faces more potential future risk if the U.S. adopts similar FCTC-aligned policies.",

The cost of the FDA user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to FDA user fees and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares, all as prescribed by the FSPTCA and FDA regulations. Payments for user fees are adjusted for several factors, including market share and industry volume. For a discussion of the impact of the FDA user fee payments on Altria, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Payments Under State Settlement Agreements and FDA Regulation below. In addition, compliance with the FSPTCA's regulatory requirements has resulted, and will continue to result, in additional costs for Altria's tobacco operating companies. The amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year to date period but could become material, either individually or in the aggregate, to one or more of Altria's tobacco subsidiaries.\n\n- Investigation and Enforcement: The FDA has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it, including document requests and other required information submissions, facility inspections, examinations and investigations, injunction proceedings, monetary penalties, product withdrawal and recall orders, and product seizures. Investigations or enforcement actions could result in significant costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the business of Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees, and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco operating companies, including adversely affecting the value of Altria's investment in JUUL.\n\n## Excise Taxes\n\nTobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the United States. Significant increases in tobacco-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted (including with respect to e-vapor products) and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal, state and local levels within the United States. The frequency and magnitude of excise tax increases can be influenced by various factors, including the composition of executive and legislative bodies.\n\nDuring 2021, Congress considered legislation that would have significantly increased the federal excise tax for all tobacco products and created a new tax for e-vapor products and other products containing nicotine that are not currently subject to a tobacco federal excise tax ('novel tobacco products'). The U.S. House of Representatives removed the proposal to increase the federal excise tax on tobacco products currently subject to the tax from the legislation it was considering, but retained the proposed nicotine tax for novel tobacco products. The U.S. Senate debated the legislation and removed the nicotine tax for novel tobacco products; however, as of February 22, 2022, the legislation is still pending before the Senate and could be subject to further tax related amendments.\n\nFederal, state and local cigarette excise taxes have increased substantially over the past two decades, far outpacing the rate of inflation. Between the end of 1998 and February 22, 2022, the weighted-average state cigarette excise tax increased from $0.36 to $1.89 per pack. As of February 22, 2022, no state has enacted new legislation increasing cigarette excise taxes in 2022, but various increases are under consideration or have been proposed.\n\nA majority of states currently tax MST using an ad valorem method, which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product, typically the wholesale price. This ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lower-priced products of equal weight. Altria supports legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on MST to a weight-based methodology because, unlike the ad valorem tax, a weight-based tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax. As of February 22, 2022, the federal government, 23 states, Puerto Rico, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Cook County, Illinois have adopted a weight-based tax methodology for MST.\n\nAn increasing number of states and localities also are imposing excise taxes on e-vapor and oral nicotine pouches. As of February 22, 2022, 30 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and a number of cities and counties have enacted legislation to tax e-vapor products. These taxes are calculated in varying ways and may differ based on the e-vapor product form. Similarly, 11 states and the District of Columbia have enacted legislation to tax oral nicotine pouches.\n\nTax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on product sales of Altria's tobacco operating companies and JUUL through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the non-premium or discount segments, to lower taxed tobacco products, or to counterfeit and contraband products. Lower sales volume and reported share performance of Altria's tobacco operating companies' and investees' products could have a material adverse effect on Altria's consolidated financial position or earnings. In addition, substantial excise tax increases on e-vapor and oral nicotine products, may negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\n## International Treaty on Tobacco Control\n\nThe World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the 'FCTC') entered into force in February 2005. As of February 22, 2022, 181 countries, as well as the European Union, have become parties to the FCTC. While the United States is a signatory of the FCTC, it is not currently a party to the agreement, as the agreement has not been submitted to, or ratified by, the U.S. Senate. The FCTC is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. The treaty recommends (and in certain instances, requires) signatory nations to enact legislation that would address various tobacco-related issues.\n\nThere are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the FCTC, some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of tobacco products. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these",

          "chunk_text": "Some countries have adopted, or are considering adopting, packaging restrictions that could have an impact similar to plain packaging. Examples  of  such  restrictions  include  standardizing  the  shape  and  size  of  packages,  prohibiting  certain  colors  or  the  use  of  certain descriptive phrases on packaging, and requiring very large graphic health warnings that leave little space for branding.\n\nRestrictions and Bans on the Use of Ingredients: The WHO and others in the public health community have recommended restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in tobacco products, including menthol. Broad restrictions and ingredient bans would require us to reformulate our American blend tobacco products and could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term. In many countries, menthol bans would eliminate the entire category of mentholated tobacco products. The European Union banned cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco products with characterizing flavors. Other tobacco products, including heated tobacco products, are exempted from this flavor ban. The EU Commission is required to withdraw this exemption for a particular product category if it determines that there is a substantial change of circumstances, such as a significant increase of EU-wide sales volumes in such product category. Other countries may follow the EU's approach. Turkey banned menthol as of May 2020. Broader ingredient bans have been adopted by Brazil and Canada.\n\nBans  on  Display  of  Tobacco  Products  at  Retail: In  a  number  of  our  markets,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  Australia  and  Russia, governments have banned the display of tobacco products at the point of sale. Other countries are considering similar bans.\n\nBans and Restrictions on Advertising, Marketing, Promotions and Sponsorships: For many years, the FCTC has called for, and countries have  imposed,  partial  or  total  bans  on  tobacco  advertising,  marketing,  promotions  and  sponsorships,  including  bans  and  restrictions  on advertising on radio and television, in print and on the Internet. The FCTC's non-binding guidelines recommend that governments prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers.\n\nRestrictions  on  Product  Design: Some  members  of  the  public  health  community  are  calling  for  the  further  standardization  of  tobacco products by requiring, for example, that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter, which would amount to a ban on slim cigarettes, or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs. In addition, at its meeting in November 2016, the CoP adopted nonbinding guidelines recommending that countries regulate product design features that increase the attractiveness of tobacco products, such as the diameter of cigarettes and the use of flavor capsules.\n\nRestrictions on Public Smoking and Use of Nicotine-Containing Products in Public: The pace and scope of restrictions on the use of our products  have  increased  significantly  in  most  of  our  markets.  Many  countries  around  the  world  have  adopted,  or  are  likely  to  adopt, regulations  that  restrict  or  ban  smoking  and  use  of  nicotine-containing  products  in  public  and/or  work  places,  restaurants,  bars  and nightclubs.  Some  public  health  groups  have  called  for,  and  some  countries,  regional  governments  and  municipalities  have  adopted  or proposed, bans on smoking in outdoor places, as well as bans on smoking in cars (typically, when minors are present) and private homes.\n\nOther Regulatory Issues: Some  regulators  are  considering,  or  in  some  cases  have  adopted,  regulatory  measures  designed  to  reduce  the supply of tobacco products. These include regulations intended to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco products by, for example, reducing the overall number of tobacco retail licenses available or banning the sale of tobacco products within specified distances of certain public facilities. In addition, South Africa banned the sale of tobacco products, e-cigarettes, and electronic devices that heat tobacco for several months during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ban, which was lifted on August 17, 2020, resulted in a significant increase of illicit trade of tobacco products.\n\nIn a limited number of markets, most notably Japan, we are dependent on governmental approvals that may limit our pricing flexibility.\n\nThe  EU  Single-Use  Plastics  Directive,  which  will  require  tobacco  manufacturers  and  importers  to  cover  the  costs  of  public  collection systems for tobacco product filters, under Extended Producer Responsibility (\"EPR\") schemes, entered into force on July 2, 2019. To date, some member states transposed the Directive into national legislation. We expect remaining member states to transpose the EU Single-Use Plastics Directive into national legislation including EPR schemes by January 2023. While we cannot predict the impact of this initiative on our business at this time, we are monitoring developments in this area.\n\nIllicit  Trade: Illicit  tobacco  trade  creates  a  cheap  and  unregulated  supply  of  tobacco  products,  undermines  efforts  to  reduce  smoking prevalence, especially among youth, damages legitimate businesses and intellectual property rights, stimulates organized crime, increases corruption and reduces government tax revenue. We generally estimate that, excluding China and the U.S., illicit trade may account for as much as 12% of global cigarette consumption; this includes counterfeit, contraband and the persistent problem of 'illicit whites,' which are cigarettes legally produced in one jurisdiction for the sole purpose of being exported and illegally sold in another jurisdiction where they have no legitimate market. Currently, we estimate that illicit trade in the European Union accounted for approximately 8% of total cigarette consumption in 2021.",

      "answer": "PM disclosed that it uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted transactions, which are excluded from the VAR model that estimates maximum one-day loss in fair value of financial instruments. The VAR model, referenced by both Disney and MDLZ, uses a variance/co-variance technique under normal market conditions with a 95% confidence level. Disney\u2019s VAR estimate for its financial instruments decreased to $255 million at the end of fiscal 2024 from $284 million in 2023 due to reduced interest rate volatility. MDLZ, using a similar VAR model, reported its estimated one-day loss from foreign exchange instruments at the end of 2023, indicating a parallel approach to quantifying exposure despite differences in hedging strategies. This shows that while both companies use VAR models to assess risk, their actual exposure and hedging focus differ, with PM actively hedging forecasted transactions outside the VAR framework.",

CCEP's performance in Belgium directly affects KO's equity income from this investment.

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. In the combustible product category, we predominantly sell American blend cigarette brands, such as Marlboro , L&amp;M , Parliament, Philip Morris and Chesterfield , which are the most popular across many of our markets. In the RRP product category, we predominantly sell Platform 1 devices and heated tobacco units under the IQOS brand  umbrella. We seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories, although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premium-price category.\n\nThe  competitive  environment  and  our  competitive  position  can  be  significantly  influenced  by  weak  economic  conditions,  erosion  of consumer  confidence,  competitors'  introduction  of  lower-price  products  or  innovative  products,  higher  tobacco  product  taxes,  higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products  and  restricts  adult  consumer  access  to  truthful  and  non-misleading  information  about  our  RRPs.  Competitors  in  our  industry include three large international tobacco companies, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and  local  tobacco  companies  and,  in  some  instances,  state-owned  tobacco  enterprises,  principally  in Algeria,  Egypt,  the  PRC,  Taiwan, Thailand  and  Vietnam.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative products  through  inappropriate  marketing  campaigns,  messaging  and  inferior  product  satisfaction,  while  not  relying  on  scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the  dissemination  of  inaccurate  and  misleading  information  about  our  RRPs,  all  of  which  could  have  a  mutual  adverse  effect  on  our profitability and results of operations.\n\n## Procurement and Raw Materials\n\nWe purchase tobacco leaf of various types, grades and styles throughout the world, mostly through independent tobacco suppliers. In 2021, we also contracted directly with farmers in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Pakistan and Poland. In 2021, direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 25% of PMI's global leaf requirements. The largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from Argentina, Brazil, China, Italy, Indonesia (mostly for domestic use in kretek products), Malawi, Mozambique, the Philippines, Turkey and the United States.\n\nWe  believe  that  there  is  an  adequate  supply  of  tobacco  leaf  in  the  world  markets  to  satisfy  our  current  and  anticipated  production requirements.",

Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

See Note 6 and Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, respectively.\n\nAs of January 31, 2025, the Company has $37.2 billion of unrecorded purchase obligations outstanding, of which $15.9 billion is due within one year. Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fix ed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fix ed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fix ed or minimum quantity, are ex cluded from the obligations quantified above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are also ex cluded as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.\n\n## Capital Resources\n\nWe believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.",

In contrast, Capital One, which has significant consumer and commercial loan portfolios, implemented the standard's requirements for financial difficulty modifications (FDMs), noting that modifications now include principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, payment delays, or term extensions without requiring concession-based assessments. Capital One specifically disclosed that FDMs in its Credit Card business receive interest rate reductions and fixed payment plans up to 60 months, while its Consumer and Commercial Banking segments offer various combinations of extensions, rate reductions, and principal reductions. These differences reflect how the same accounting standard affects disclosure practices depending on the company's core financial exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CL \u2192 ASU 2022-02: Colgate adopted ASU 2022-02 effective January 1, 2023, which eliminated troubled debt restructuring accounting and introduced new disclosure requirements, but it stated the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.",
        "Hop 2: ASU 2022-02 \u2192 Disclosure Requirements: ASU 2022-02 introduced new requirements for disclosing financial difficulty modifications (FDMs), including types of modifications offered and borrower conditions, replacing the previous troubled debt restructuring framework.",
        "Hop 3: Disclosure Requirements \u2190 COF: Capital One implemented ASU 2022-02 and disclosed specific types of FDMs across its business lines, including interest rate reductions and fixed payment plans in Credit Card, and extensions, rate reductions, and principal reductions in Consumer and Commercial Banking."

      "question": "How does Coca-Cola's reliance on Arca Continental in northern Argentina compare to PepsiCo's exposure to economic volatility in the same region, considering both companies' geographic revenue distribution and risk management strategies?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola relies on Arca Continental for bottling and distribution operations in northern Argentina, which is part of the 83% of Coca-Cola\u2019s worldwide unit case volume that comes from outside the U.S., with Argentina being one of the top non-U.S. markets contributing to that volume. Meanwhile, PepsiCo reports that Argentina is among the international markets where volatile economic, political, and social conditions create challenging operating environments, and it actively uses foreign exchange derivatives ($2.8 billion notional value in 2021) to hedge against currency risks in such regions. While Coca-Cola manages its exposure through bottler agreements and pricing models, PepsiCo directly addresses Argentina\u2019s instability as a risk factor and uses financial instruments to mitigate foreign exchange exposure, which in 2021 included a 1 percentage point revenue uplift from favorable exchange rates\u2014partly driven by the Mexican peso and other emerging market currencies.",

        "Hop 1: KO \u2192 Arca Continental: Coca-Cola depends on Arca Continental for bottling and distribution in northern Argentina, contributing to the 83% of global volume outside the U.S., with Argentina being a key non-U.S. market.",
        "Hop 2: Arca Continental \u2192 Argentina: Arca Continental operates in northern Argentina, making it a key regional bottler for Coca-Cola, subject to local economic and regulatory conditions.",

Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nInflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' for further discussion.\n\n## Commodity Prices\n\nOur  commodity  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $1.6  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $1.1 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  At  the  end  of  2021,  the  potential  change  in  fair  value  of  commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $177 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nOur operations outside of the United States generated 44% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa, collectively, comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks  in  the  international  markets  in  which  our  products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2021,  favorable  foreign  exchange  contributed  1  percentage  point  to  net  revenue  growth,  primarily  due  to appreciation  in  the  Mexican  peso,  Canadian  dollar  and  South African  rand.  Currency  declines  against  the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.\n\nIn addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold,  including  in Argentina,  Brazil,  China,  Mexico,  the Middle  East,  Russia  and  Turkey,  and  currency  controls  or  fluctuations  in  certain  of  these  international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments.\n\nOur foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $1.9 billion  as  of  December 26, 2020. At the end of 2021, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $278 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.\n\nThe total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nOur interest  rate  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $2.1  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $3.0 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  Assuming  year-end  2021  investment  levels  and  variable  rate  debt,  a  1percentage-point  increase  in  interest  rates  would  have  decreased  our  net  interest  expense  in  2021  by  $47 million  due  to  higher  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  levels,  as  compared  with  our variable rate debt.\n\n## OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\n## Results of Operations - Consolidated Review\n\n## Volume\n\nPhysical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions,  including  the  preparation  of  our  annual  operating  plan  and  the  evaluation  of  our  business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level.",

      "question": "How do PepsiCo and Mondelez differ in their approach to valuing intangible assets, particularly given the sensitivity of valuation methods to assumptions like discount rates and future cash flows?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo assigns fair value to intangible assets during acquisitions by considering factors like marketplace participants, product life cycles, and future cash flows discounted at appropriate rates. Mondelez, on the other hand, uses specific valuation methods like relief from royalty, excess earnings, and excess margin to estimate the fair value of its brand names, which include assumptions on future sales, royalty rates, and discount rates. MET\u2019s filing highlights that valuation methods can materially affect fair value estimates, emphasizing the sensitivity of these calculations to underlying assumptions. Therefore, while both companies rely on discounted cash flow techniques, PepsiCo\u2019s approach is more holistic during acquisitions, whereas Mondelez applies structured valuation models annually, with MET underscoring the broader implications of assumption variability on fair value outcomes.",

      "answer": "Under the Distribution Agreement, PMI indemnifies Altria and PM USA for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured by PM USA for PMI, while PM USA indemnifies PMI for liabilities related to products PM USA manufactures independently. However, PMI has agreed not to seek indemnification from PM USA for the IQOS patent infringement litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. This means PMI bears the full cost of that specific litigation, which could influence its financial capacity to cover other liabilities, including international tobacco litigation where PM is exposed. Therefore, PM may face greater direct financial exposure in international cases without a corresponding indemnification mechanism from PM USA, assuming PMI's resources are strained by its self-covered U.S. litigation costs.",

        "Hop 1: MO \u2192 PMI: MO (Altria) and PMI are bound by a Distribution Agreement that allocates tobacco product liabilities based on the manufacturer, with PMI indemnifying Altria and PM USA for PMI-manufactured product liabilities.",

        "Hop 3: PM USA \u2190 PM: PM faces international tobacco litigation risks where it may bear full liability, and there is no explicit indemnification from PM USA, which could increase PM's financial exposure if PMI's resources are strained by its self-covered U.S. litigation."

Deconsolidation of RBH for disclosures related to the deconsolidation of RBH.\n\n## Note 17.\n\n## Contingencies:\n\n## Tobacco-Related Litigation\n\nLegal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us, and/or our subsidiaries, and/or our indemnitees in various jurisdictions. Our indemnitees include distributors, licensees, and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend, as well as to pay costs and some or all of judgments, if any, that may be entered against them. Pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. (\"Altria\") and PMI, PMI will indemnify Altria and Philip Morris USA Inc. (\"PM USA\"), a  U.S.  tobacco  subsidiary  of Altria,  for  tobacco  product  claims  based  in  substantial  part  on  products  manufactured  by  PMI  or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI.\n\nIt  is  possible  that  there  could  be  adverse  developments  in  pending  cases  against  us  and  our  subsidiaries.  An  unfavorable  outcome  or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.\n\nDamages claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in Brazil, Canada and Nigeria, range into the billions  of  U.S.  dollars.  The  variability  in  pleadings  in  multiple  jurisdictions,  together  with  the  actual  experience  of  management  in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. Much of the tobacco-related litigation is in its early stages, and litigation is subject to uncertainty. However, as discussed below, we have to date been largely successful in defending tobacco-related litigation.",

      "question": "How does Altria's investment in Cronos expose it to regulatory risks under the Controlled Substances Act, and how does this compare to Walmart's direct legal exposure under the same act?",
      "answer": "Altria's investment in Cronos exposes it to regulatory risks under the Controlled Substances Act due to Cronos's involvement in cannabis cultivation and distribution, which are tightly regulated under U.S. federal law. A failure by Cronos to comply with these laws could result in legal and reputational consequences for Altria. In contrast, Walmart faces direct legal exposure under the Controlled Substances Act through ongoing DOJ litigation alleging unlawful dispensing and distribution of controlled substances from its pharmacies, with potential penalties and injunctive relief still pending after partial dismissal of the case.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: Altria (MO) \u2192 Cronos: Altria holds an investment in Cronos, a Canadian cannabinoid company, which subjects Altria to legal, regulatory, and reputational risks stemming from Cronos's compliance with U.S. federal laws like the Controlled Substances Act.",
        "Hop 2: Cronos \u2192 Controlled Substances Act: Cronos's operations in cannabis-derived products place it under the purview of the Controlled Substances Act, among other U.S. federal regulations, creating a direct regulatory link between Cronos and the Act.",
        "Hop 3: Controlled Substances Act \u2190 Walmart (WMT): Walmart faces direct legal action from the DOJ under the Controlled Substances Act, alleging unlawful dispensing and distribution of controlled substances, with ongoing litigation and partial dismissal of claims still pending."

      "question": "How does Walmart's exposure to anti-money laundering regulations in its international operations compare to Altria's regulatory risks stemming from its investment in Cronos, particularly given both companies' reliance on compliance with U.S. and foreign laws?",
      "answer": "Walmart faces exposure to anti-money laundering (AML) laws as part of its international operations in countries like India, Mexico, and Canada, where it must comply with local and U.S. regulatory frameworks, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.S. sanctions laws. Non-compliance by associates or agents could lead to fines, penalties, and reputational harm. Meanwhile, Altria's investment in Cronos subjects it to AML laws in the U.S., such as the Controlled Substances Act and Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act, due to Cronos's involvement in cannabis-related products. A failure by Cronos or Altria to comply with these laws could result in criminal or civil liability and reputational harm. Both companies face significant compliance burdens, but Walmart\u2019s AML risk is tied to its broad global retail footprint and supply chain, while Altria\u2019s stems from its strategic investment in a highly regulated cannabis company.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: WMT \u2192 Anti-Money Laundering Laws: Walmart operates in 7 countries and generated 18% of its consolidated net sales from international operations in fiscal 2025, exposing it to AML laws and the risk of violations by associates or agents leading to penalties.",
        "Hop 2: Anti-Money Laundering Laws \u2192 Cronos: Cronos is subject to U.S. AML laws including the Controlled Substances Act and Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act due to its cannabis-related business, and Altria's investment in Cronos exposes it to these regulatory risks.",
        "Hop 3: Cronos \u2190 MO: Altria discloses that its investment in Cronos subjects it to legal, regulatory, and reputational risks, including the potential for criminal, civil, or tax liability if Cronos fails to comply with applicable laws such as cannabis and AML regulations."

          "chunk_text": "As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency ex change rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.\n\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores, clubs and eCommerce platforms around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our results of operations.\n\n## Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks\n\nOur international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.\n\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we operate retail and eCommerce businesses in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.\n\nDuring fiscal 2025, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions; legal and regulatory constraints, such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as in India; restrictive governmental actions, such as trade protection measures or nationalization; antitrust and competition law regulatory matters, such as those underway in Canada, Mexico and India (relating to our Flipkart subsidiary); local product safety and environmental laws; tax regulations; local labor laws; anti-money laundering laws and regulations; trade policies; foreign ex change or currency regulations; laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection; and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.\n\nChanging our operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade or newly imposed sanctions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and we may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. In addition, tensions between nation-state governments and conflicts of laws may lead to challenges for our operations. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response, or consumer boycotts in certain regions, could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could also adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they recur, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also ex ist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, geopolitical tensions or events, laws and regulations.\n\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or U.S. sanctions laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries. Our global policies designed to regulate such business practices and our global compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations may not be adequate to prevent the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are appropriately regulated by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could subject us to fines and penalties and adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.",

If the carrying value of our investment in ABI exceeds its fair value and we determine that the loss in value is other than temporary, we record appropriate impairment losses. In a prior period, we concluded that the fair value of our investment in ABI declined below the carrying value of our investment in ABI and that this decline in fair value was other than temporary. As a result, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge for that period. It is possible that we may be required to record significant impairment charges in the future and, if we do so, our net earnings and carrying value of our investment in ABI could be materially adversely affected.\n\nIn the event that our ownership percentage in ABI were to decrease below certain levels, (i) we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, (ii) the number of nominees that we have the right to select for election to the ABI board of directors could be reduced and (iii) we may be unable to continue to account for our investment in ABI under the equity method of accounting.\n\n## Our investment in Cronos subjects us to certain risks associated with Cronos's business, including legal, regulatory and reputational risks.\n\nOur investment in Cronos, a Canadian cannabinoid company, subjects us to various risks relating to Cronos's business, such as legal, regulatory and reputational risks. Cronos is engaged in the cultivation, manufacture and marketing of cannabis and cannabis-derived products for the medical and adult-use markets in various international jurisdictions. Accordingly, Cronos's operations are subject to laws, regulations and guidelines promulgated by various governmental authorities. In the United States, these laws include the Controlled Substances Act, the Civil Assets Forfeiture Reform Act (as it relates to violation of the Controlled Substances Act), all related applicable anti-money laundering laws and FDA regulations. A failure by Cronos or Altria to comply with applicable laws, including cannabis laws, could result in criminal, civil or tax  liability, negative impacts on the availability and cost of capital and credit or reputational harm for Altria.\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 1C. Cybersecurity.\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe rely extensively on information technology, much of which is managed by third-party service providers (such as cloud data service providers), to support a variety of business processes and activities, including: complying with regulatory, legal, financial reporting and tax  requirements; engaging in marketing and ecommerce activities; managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations; researching, developing, manufacturing and distributing our products; collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information; and communicating with employees, investors, suppliers, trade customers, adult tobacco consumers and others. Recognizing the critical importance of cybersecurity in today's digital landscape, we are committed to safeguarding our information assets, protecting consumer data and maintaining the integrity and availability of our systems. Accordingly, we have implemented an extensive cybersecurity risk management framework designed to identify, assess, mitigate and prevent potential cybersecurity risks and to align with industry best practices and all applicable regulatory requirements. We leverage the National Institute of Standards and Technology ('NIST') Cybersecurity Framework and industry best practices to identify and prioritize cybersecurity risks based on their potential impacts. We also use the NIST framework and industry best practices to drive enhancements to our program that are designed to protect our assets and third-party partners. The NIST framework also helps us maintain ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements. We align our security standards for infrastructure configuration with the Center for Internet Security's Benchmarks, which are prescriptive recommendations based upon the consensus of global cybersecurity experts.\n\nOur framework is built around the following key principles: (i) risk assessment and threat intelligence; (ii) security controls; (iii) incident response; (iv) employee awareness and training; and (v) third-party risk management. We have integrated our cybersecurity framework into our broad enterprise risk management processes, which allows us to leverage our existing enterprise-wide experience in managing risk and adapting to change in the cybersecurity threat landscape.\n\n- Risk Assessment and Threat Intelligence: We conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats. Our Information Technology ('IT') Risk Management function, overseen by our Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO'), leads internal self-assessments, which involve evaluating the security posture of critical systems, networks and applications as well as the potential impact of cybersecurity threats on our business operations, financial condition and reputation. IT Risk Management also conducts ongoing threat monitoring and has implemented monitoring systems, including technologies such as intrusion detection systems, security information and event management tools and threat intelligence programs.\n\nWe regularly engage third-party consulting services to conduct audits and assessments of the effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls and processes and identify areas for improvement based on developments in industry best practices. We typically engage these services",

Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings.

In contrast, while PEP does not disclose specific revenue figures for AMEA, it measures beverage volume in terms of bottler case sales (BCS) and concentrate shipments (CSE), indicating a supply chain model reliant on independent bottlers and joint ventures. This suggests that although both companies operate in the AMEA region, MDLZ's beverage business is smaller and directly reported, while PEP's operations are more volume-focused and distributed through a decentralized bottling network.",

      "answer": "MDLZ's biscuit business contributed 7.8% to its AMEA segment revenue in 2021, indicating a significant but not dominant role within the 22.5% total AMEA net revenues. In contrast, PEP operates in the AMEA region through joint ventures such as the Lipton ready-to-drink tea partnership with Unilever, which is a core part of their beverage strategy. This suggests that while MDLZ leverages biscuits as a key product line in AMEA, PEP relies on strategic alliances to expand its beverage footprint in the same market.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 compared with 2020:\n\nNet revenues increased $145 million (1.8%), due to the impact of acquisitions (1.8 pp), higher net pricing (1.0 pp) and favorable currency (0.6 pp), partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix (1.6 pp). The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give &amp; Go added incremental net revenues of $106 million and the January 4, 2021 acquisition of Hu added incremental net revenues of $38 million in 2021. Higher net pricing was driven by biscuits, gum and candy, partially offset by lower net pricing in chocolate. Favorable currency impact was due to the strength of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Unfavorable volume mix reflected volume declines as the region lapped prior-year strong volume growth driven by significantly increased food purchases for in-home consumption due to the pandemic as well as impacts from labor disruptions and supply chain constraints in the second half of 2021. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in biscuits, candy, chocolate and gum.\n\nSegment operating income decreased $216 million (13.6%), primarily due to unfavorable volume/mix, higher raw material costs, higher Simplify to Grow Program costs and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including lower COVID-19 related costs), a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower manufacturing costs (lower incremental COVID-19 related costs and productivity) and favorable currency.\n\n## 2020 compared with 2019:\n\nNet revenues increased $1,049 million (14.8%), due to favorable volume/mix (6.3 pp), the impact of acquisitions (6.3 pp) and higher net pricing (2.3 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (0.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix, in part due to the positive volume impact from COVID-19 as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption, was driven by gains in biscuits, partially offset by declines in gum, chocolate and candy. The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give &amp; Go added incremental net revenues of $390 million and the July 16, 2019 acquisition of a majority interest in Perfect Snacks added net revenues of $55 million in 2020. Higher net pricing was driven by biscuits, chocolate and candy, partially offset by lower net pricing in gum. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar.\n\nSegment operating income increased $136 million (9.4%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing and the impact of acquisitions. These favorable items were partially offset by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, intangible asset impairment charges, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including incremental COVID-19 related costs), higher raw material costs, lapping the benefit from prior-year pension participation changes and higher costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program.",

      "question": "How does the use of foreign currency option contracts by Colgate-Palmolive compare to PepsiCo's exposure to foreign exchange risk, given the role of these contracts in managing liabilities denominated in currencies such as the euro, Canadian dollar, and Chinese yuan?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo reported that in 2024, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced its net revenue performance by 1.5 percentage points, and 44% of its consolidated net revenue came from operations outside the United States, exposing it to foreign currency liabilities. To manage this risk, PepsiCo uses derivatives, including foreign exchange forward and option contracts, which are also utilized by Colgate-Palmolive. Colgate-Palmolive specifically uses foreign currency contracts, including forward, swap, and option contracts, to hedge portions of its foreign currency purchases, assets, and liabilities, with contract durations generally not exceeding 12 months. The role of these option contracts, as outlined in the second evidence chunk, is to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities, and they are used by both companies to offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of foreign currency exposures. However, while PepsiCo hedges forecasted foreign currency transactions up to four years in advance, Colgate-Palmolive limits its foreign currency contracts to a maximum duration of 12 months.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PEP \u2192 Foreign Currency Liabilities: PepsiCo discloses that it is exposed to foreign exchange risk from foreign currency liabilities and that in 2024, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue performance by 1.5 percentage points, with 44% of revenue generated outside the U.S.",
        "Hop 2: Foreign Currency Liabilities \u2192 Option Contracts: Foreign exchange option contracts are used to protect the value of foreign currency assets and liabilities, and are part of both cash flow and fair value hedging strategies, with notional amounts reaching $9.9 billion for cash flow hedges as of September 28, 2024.",

PepsiCo's risk oversight processes and disclosure controls and procedures are designed to appropriately escalate key risks to the Board as well as to analyze potential risks for disclosure.\n\n## Market Risks\n\nWe are exposed to market risks arising from  adverse changes in:\n\n- commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw m aterials and energy;\n- foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and\n- i n terest rates.\n\nIn the norm al course of business, we m anage com m odity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity  initiatives,  global  purchasing  program s  and  hedging.  Ongoing  productivity  initiatives  involve  the  identification  and  effective i m pl em entati on  of   m eani ngf ul   cost-savi ng  opportuni ti es  or  ef f i ci en ci es,  i n cl u di n g   th e  u se  of   deri v ati v es.

Risk Factors' for further discussion of our m arket risks.\n\nThe fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on m arket rates and prices.  The sensitivity of our derivatives to these m arket fluctuations is discussed below . See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statem ents for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is im pacted by changes in m arket conditions, including interest rates and inflationary , deflationary and recessionary conditions. See 'Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estim ates' for a discussion of the exposure of our goodwill and other intangible assets and pension and retiree m edical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to m arket fluctuations.\n\nInflati onary , defl ati onary and recessionary conditions im pacting these m arket risks also im pact the dem and for and pricing of our products. See 'Item 1A.

At the end of 2024, the potential change in fair value of com m odity derivative contracts, assum ing a 10% decrease in the underlying com m odity price, would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2024 by $140 m illion, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying com m odity purchases.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nOur operations outside of the United States generated 44% of our consolidated net revenue in 2024, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil, collectively , com prising approxim ately 25% of our consolidated net revenue in 2024. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international m arkets in which our products are m ade, m anufactured, distributed or sold.

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material, as it is the Company's policy to contract only with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, sourcing strategies, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company's treasury and risk management policies, which prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose. It is the Company's policy to enter into derivative instrument contracts with terms that match the underlying exposure being hedged. Provided below are details of the Company's exposures by type of risk and derivative instruments by type of hedge designation.\n\n## Valuation Considerations\n\nThe Company's derivative instruments include foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts. The fair value of these instruments are classified as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements.\n\nThe Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates (Level 2 valuation).\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company utilizes forward-starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rates for future debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates (Level 2 valuation).",

      "answer": "The 2006 Order restricts Altria and PM USA from transferring their cigarette brands or business without the transferee submitting to the jurisdiction of the court and subjecting itself to the Order. The U.S. government believes the 2022 Agreement transferring Platform 1 commercialization rights to PMI falls under this restriction, requiring PMI to submit to the 2006 Order before the transaction can be finalized. This regulatory uncertainty could delay PMI\u2019s full entry into the U.S. smoke-free market. Meanwhile, PM USA guarantees Altria\u2019s $1.0 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in November 2023, meaning PM USA remains financially liable for Altria\u2019s debt obligations, even as Altria transitions Platform 1 rights to PMI.",

      "question": "How does the difference in vesting periods for restricted stock units (RSUs) between Walmart and Philip Morris impact their respective unrecognized compensation costs as of 2023?",
      "answer": "Walmart's RSUs generally vest at a rate of approximately 8% each quarter over a three-year period, while Philip Morris RSUs typically vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. As of December 31, 2023, Philip Morris had $160 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested RSU awards, expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately seventeen months. Walmart recognizes the fair value of restricted stock units ratably over the vesting period, which has varied historically from a three-year quarterly vesting schedule to four-year and five-year vesting periods. The faster vesting schedule at Walmart (quarterly over three years) compared to PM (cliff vesting at three years) likely results in a more evenly distributed compensation expense for Walmart, whereas PM carries a larger portion of unrecognized costs for a longer initial period before expense recognition is completed.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: WMT \u2192 Vesting Schedule: Walmart discloses that RSUs generally vest at 8% each quarter over a 3-year period, with historical variations (4-year and 5-year vesting schedules). The company recognizes RSU expense ratably over the vesting period.",
        "Hop 2: Vesting Schedule \u2192 RSU Awards: Vesting schedules determine the pattern of expense recognition for RSU awards, with Walmart's quarterly vesting creating a more even expense pattern versus PM's cliff vesting.",
        "Hop 3: RSU Awards \u2190 PM: Philip Morris had $160 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested RSUs as of December 31, 2023, with costs expected to be recognized over approximately seventeen months despite a typical 3-year vesting period."

      "answer": "COST reported no Level 1 or Level 3 financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in 2022, indicating it did not hold exchange-traded instruments like commodity futures. In contrast, MDLZ actively uses commodity futures\u2014classified as Level 1 financial assets\u2014to hedge price risks on raw materials such as cocoa, sugar, and vegetable oils. Since Level 1 financial assets consist of exchange-traded derivatives with observable market prices, MDLZ's use of these instruments aligns with that classification, highlighting a strategic difference between the two companies in managing commodity exposure.",

See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.\n\nWe record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our asset derivatives is recorded within other current assets and other assets and the fair value of our liability derivatives is recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. Non-cash changes in unrealized gains and losses related to our unsettled derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in other non-cash items, net, within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments that are designated, and those that are economic hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating activities. Cash flows related to the settlement of all other free-standing derivative instruments are classified within investing activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Currency movements related to our non-U.S. debt and our net investments in non-U.S. operations, as well as the related deferred taxes, are recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.\n\nWhen we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.\n\nCommodity derivatives . We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nCurrency exchange derivatives . We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.

These option contracts are specifically designed to offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of forecasted foreign currency transactions, thereby reducing earnings volatility.

The Company elected to invest a majority of its solvency capital in a portfolio of marketable equity and debt securities. These securities are included in the disclosures above. The Company uses one of our consolidated captive insurance companies to reinsure group annuity insurance contracts that cover the obligations of certain of our European and Canadian pension plans. This captive's solvency capital funds included total equity and debt securities of $1,883 million and $1,643 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were classified in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets because the assets were not available to satisfy our current obligations.\n\n## NOTE 5: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company's financial performance and are referred to as 'market risks.' When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\n\nThe Company uses various types of derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative returns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect ex pected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes) a call option, or alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-derivative instruments, such as our foreign currency denominated third-party debt, in hedging relationships.\n\nAll derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid ex penses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with the same counterparty.\n\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our consolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the values of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings.\n\nFor derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures.\n\nThe Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to Note 17. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency ex change rates, commodity rates or other financial indices.

      "answer": "KO uses option contracts as part of its hedging strategy to manage financial risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. These contracts are used to hedge both existing exposures and forecasted transactions, with unrealized gains and losses deferred in AOCI until the hedged transactions occur. In contrast, WMT has $15.9 billion in recorded firm commitments due within one year, primarily related to inventory purchases, capital expenditures, and service contracts, which are not hedged through derivative instruments. While KO actively mitigates risk using derivatives like option contracts, WMT's firm commitments represent direct financial obligations without such hedging mechanisms, indicating differing approaches to managing future cash outflows.",

          "chunk_text": "## Captive Insurance Companies\n\nIn accordance with local insurance regulations, our consolidated captive insurance companies are required to meet and maintain minimum solvency capital requirements. The Company elected to invest a majority of its solvency capital in a portfolio of marketable equity and debt securities. These securities are included in the disclosures above. The Company uses one of our consolidated captive insurance companies to reinsure group annuity insurance contracts that cover the obligations of certain of our European and Canadian pension plans. This captive's solvency capital funds included total equity and debt securities of $1,883 million and $1,643 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were classified in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets because the assets were not available to satisfy our current obligations.\n\n## NOTE 5: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company's financial performance and are referred to as 'market risks.' When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\n\nThe Company uses various types of derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative returns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect ex pected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes) a call option, or alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-derivative instruments, such as our foreign currency denominated third-party debt, in hedging relationships.\n\nAll derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid ex penses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with the same counterparty.\n\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our consolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the values of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings.\n\nFor derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures.\n\nThe Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to Note 17. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency ex change rates, commodity rates or other financial indices.

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations. See Note 6 and Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, respectively.\n\nAs of January 31, 2025, the Company has $37.2 billion of unrecorded purchase obligations outstanding, of which $15.9 billion is due within one year. Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fix ed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fix ed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fix ed or minimum quantity, are ex cluded from the obligations quantified above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are also ex cluded as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.\n\n## Capital Resources\n\nWe believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.",

These investments are diversified to mitigate duration and credit exposure, suggesting a measured approach to managing interest rate risk. On the other hand, Costco directly holds $529 million in government and agency securities as of 2022, which are typically more directly sensitive to interest rate movements due to their fixed nature and lack of diversification across credit strategies.

          "chunk_text": "## Investment Strategy for U.S. Pension Plans\n\nThe Company utilizes the services of investment managers to actively manage the assets of our U.S. pension plans. We have established asset allocation targets and investment guidelines with each investment manager. Our asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the plans. Selection of the targeted asset allocation for U.S. pension plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes. Our target allocation is a mix of 42 percent equity investments, 30 percent fixed-income investments and 28 percent alternative investments. We believe this target allocation will enable us to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:\n\n- (1) optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk;\n- (2) maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers; and\n- (3) maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class.\n\nThe guidelines that have been established with each investment manager provide parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable. Investment managers agree to obtain written approval for deviations from stated investment style or guidelines. As of December 31, 2021, no investment manager was responsible for more than 8 percent of total U.S. pension plan assets.\n\nOur target allocation of 42 percent equity investments is composed of 60 percent global equities, 16 percent emerging market equities and 24 percent domestic small-cap and mid-cap equities. Optimal returns through our investments in global equities are achieved through security selection as well as country and sector diversification. Investments in our common stock accounted for approximately 5 percent of total global equities and approximately 3 percent of total U.S. pension plan assets. Our investments in global equities are intended to provide diversified exposure to both U.S. and non-U.S. equity markets. Our investments in both emerging market equities and domestic small-cap and mid-cap equities may experience large swings in their market value. Our investments in these asset classes are selected based on capital appreciation potential.\n\nOur target allocation of 30 percent fixed-income investments is composed of 33 percent long-duration bonds and 67 percent with multi-strategy alternative credit managers. Long-duration bonds are intended to provide a stable rate of return through investments in high-quality publicly traded debt securities. Our investments in long-duration bonds are diversified in order to mitigate duration and credit exposure. Multi-strategy alternative credit managers invest in a combination of high-yield bonds, bank loans, structured credit and emerging market debt. These investments are in lower-rated and non-rated debt securities, which generally produce higher returns compared to long-duration bonds and also help to diversify our overall fixed-income portfolio.\n\nOur target allocation for alternative investments is 28 percent. These alternative investments include hedge funds, reinsurance, private equity limited partnerships, leveraged buyout funds, international venture capital partnerships and real estate. The objective of investing in alternative investments is to provide a higher rate of return than that which is typically available from publicly traded equity securities. Alternative investments are inherently illiquid and require a long-term perspective in evaluating investment performance.\n\n## Investment Strategy for Non-U.S. Pension Plans\n\nThe long-term target allocation for 70 percent of our international subsidiaries' pension plan assets, primarily certain of our European and Canadian plans, was 66 percent equity securities, 4 percent fixed-income securities and 30 percent other investments. The actual allocation for the remaining 30 percent of the Company's international subsidiaries' pension plan assets consisted of 44 percent mutual, pooled and commingled funds; 21 percent fixed-income securities; 1 percent equity securities and 34 percent other investments. The investment strategies for our international subsidiaries' pension plans vary greatly, and in some instances are influenced by local law. None of our pension plans outside the United States is individually significant for separate disclosure.",

      "answer": "Arca Continental's operations in northern Argentina allowed KO to maintain a presence in the region, contributing to KO's 83% non-U.S. unit case volume in 2021, despite the challenges in the Argentine market. In contrast, Walmart's decision to exit Argentina in fiscal 2021 suggests that the market may not have aligned with Walmart's long-term strategic goals, despite its earlier operations there. This divergence highlights the strategic importance KO placed on beverage distribution through Arca Continental, even as Walmart concluded its operations were not viable in the same region.",

Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 42 percent of U.S. unit case volume. Unit case volume outside the United States represented 83 percent of the Company's worldwide unit case volume in 2021. The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 48 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\n\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 48 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\n\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

The Company previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 for discussion of recent divestitures. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\n\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.\n\nThe Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Discussion and Analysis - Consolidated Operating Results in  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2021.\n\n## Operating Results by Business Segment\n\n## Business Environment\n\n## Taxes, Legislation, Regulation and Other Matters Regarding the Manufacture, Marketing, Sale and Use of Tobacco Products\n\nThe tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash  flows  and  financial  position.  These  challenges,  which  are  discussed  below  and  in  ' Cautionary  Factors  That  May  Affect  Future Results ,' include:\n\n- regulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other nicotinecontaining products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or even ban certain of our products;\n- fiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;\n- illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called 'illicit whites';\n- intense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;\n- pending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies ; and\n- governmental investigations.\n\nRegulatory  Restrictions: The  tobacco  industry  operates  in  a  highly  regulated  environment.  The  well-known  risks  of  smoking  have  led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.\n\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  (the  'FCTC')  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (the  \"WHO\"),  which  entered  into  force  in  2005.  The  FCTC  has  as  its  main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others.  The  FCTC  governing  body,  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  ('CoP'),  has  also  adopted  non-binding  guidelines  and  policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty. In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for  more  scientific  assessment  and  improved  reporting  to  define  policy  on  heated  tobacco  products.  Similar  to  its  previous  policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\n\nPrior to CoP 9 that took place in November 2021, the WHO and the WHO FCTC Secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products. The reports were noted by CoP 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to CoP 10, currently scheduled  for  2023.  It  is  not  possible  to  predict  whether  or  to  what  extent  measures  recommended  by  the  WHO's  reports  will  be implemented as the reports are not binding to the WHO Member States.\n\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today, but how fast, and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that recognize a significant difference on a risk continuum between combustible tobacco on the one hand and non-combustible tobacco and other nicotine-containing products on the other. Regulation should include measures that will accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such products to",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\n\nAs we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our ov erall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adv erse effects that the v olatility of these markets may hav e on our operating results.\n\nWe principally utilize deriv ativ e instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from v olatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our deriv ativ e activ ity and the types of deriv ativ e instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 10, Financial Instruments .\n\nMany of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create v olatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the  U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated  reporting  generally  results  in  a  cumulativ e  translation  adjustment  to  other  comprehensiv e  income  within  equity. A  stronger  U.S.  dollar relativ e to other functional currencies adv ersely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate v olatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Operations by Operating Segment under Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results for  currency  exchange  effects  on  our  financial  results.  T hroughout  our  discussion  and  analysis  of  results,  we  isolate  currency  impacts  and supplementally prov ide net rev enues, operating income and diluted earnings per share on a constant currency basis. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, recent currency dev aluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting .\n\nWe also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather  conditions,  gov ernment  policy  and  regulation  and  the  macroeconomic  env ironment.  Refer  to Recent  Developments  and  Significant  Items Affecting Comparability and Financial Outlook above for updates on recent supply chain, labor and other disruptions that are increasing operating costs and  impacting  our  results.  T o  manage  input  cost  v olatility  and  inflation,  we  enter  into  forward  purchase  agreements  and  other  deriv ativ e  financial instruments. We also pursue productiv ity and cost sav ing measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings.\n\nWe regularly ev aluate our v ariable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital.

T he VAR analysis was done separately as of each quarter end for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios using historical market mov ements. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receiv ables, and net inv estments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the abov e-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.",

This unfavorable impact was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the Argentine peso, Nigerian naira, Zimbabwean dollar, Turkish lira and Japanese yen, which had an unfavorable impact on our Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the British pound and euro, which had a favorable impact on our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Global Ventures operating segments. Refer to the heading 'Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position - Foreign Exchange' below for additional information about the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n'Acquisitions and divestitures' generally refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the Company considers to be structural changes. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in net operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we removed the net operating revenues associated with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. Management believes that quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the Company's net operating revenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their understanding of the Company's net operating revenue performance by improving their ability to compare our year-to-year results. Management considers the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when evaluating the Company's performance. Refer to the heading 'Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands' above for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.\n\nNet operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures. The size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period. Based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we ex pect foreign currency ex change rate fluctuations will have an unfavorable impact on our full year 2025 net operating revenues.\n\nInformation about our net operating revenues by operating segment and Corporate as a percentage of Company net operating revenues is as follows:\n\n",

Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material, as it is the Company's policy to contract only with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, sourcing strategies, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company's treasury and risk management policies, which prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose. It is the Company's policy to enter into derivative instrument contracts with terms that match the underlying exposure being hedged. Provided below are details of the Company's exposures by type of risk and derivative instruments by type of hedge designation.\n\n## Valuation Considerations\n\nThe Company's derivative instruments include foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts. The fair value of these instruments are classified as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nAs the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements.\n\nThe Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates (Level 2 valuation).\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company manages its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The Company utilizes forward-starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rates for future debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates (Level 2 valuation).",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings.

The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

      "answer": "Nebraska, along with Iowa, Kansas, and Arkansas, enacted legislation in 2023 to reduce corporate income tax rates for future years, which resulted in a $114 million reduction in deferred tax expense for companies operating in those states, including Target. This tax relief likely benefits Target's financial position as it operates 14 stores in Nebraska. In contrast, Altria faces increasing regulatory pressures in multiple states, including bans on flavored tobacco products and nicotine content restrictions, particularly in states like California, Massachusetts, and New York. These regulations could materially affect Altria's business operations and revenue streams, creating a stark contrast with the tax relief seen by Target in Nebraska.",

      "question": "How does MO's $1.8 billion e-vapor goodwill exposure compare to MDLZ's litigation and regulatory risk profile under shared FDA oversight, given MO's additional regulatory risk through its investment in Cronos and its subjectivity to cannabis-related enforcement actions?",
      "answer": "MO faces $1.8 billion in carrying value exposure for its e-vapor reporting unit, which is highly sensitive to regulatory outcomes, including FDA actions that could impact market viability and result in impairment charges. This risk is amplified by MO\u2019s equity investment in Cronos, a cannabinoid company directly subject to FDA regulations, where non-compliance could trigger legal and reputational fallout affecting MO. Meanwhile, MDLZ faces risks from FDA-regulated product safety concerns, including potential recalls, litigation (e.g., the Bryce Martinez lawsuit), and regulatory enforcement that could materially impact its financial condition and brand reputation. Both companies are exposed to FDA-driven outcomes, but MO\u2019s exposure is compounded through its direct investment in a cannabis firm facing stricter federal scrutiny, potentially leading to greater regulatory-induced volatility in its asset valuations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nmaterial non-cash impairment of our e-vapor reporting unit's goodwill or related definite-lived intangible assets (carrying value of $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2024), or both, in future periods. Based on our 2024 annual impairment test, a hypothetical 1% increase to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the e-vapor reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $125 million.\n\nWe made various judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived assets, the most significant of which were volume, revenue, income, perpetual growth rates and discount rates in performing our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our annual impairment test incorporated assumptions used in our long-term financial forecast, which is used by our management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. The assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. The perpetual growth rates and discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 0% to 2% and 10.0% to 13.5%, respectively. Additionally, in determining these significant assumptions, we made judgments regarding the: (i) timing of effective enforcement against illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products; (ii) timing and receipt of regulatory authorizations of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches and e-vapor products; (iii) long-term growth of innovative tobacco products, including oral nicotine pouches, and the related impact on the MST category; (iv) long-term growth of the e-vapor category; (v) conversion rates of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor consumers to pod-based systems and specifically, NJOY ACE ; and (vi) ability of NJOY ACE to remain on the market. Fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of our control.\n\nAlthough our discounted cash flow analyses are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information as of October 1, 2024, our annual impairment testing date, we used significant judgment in determining future cash flows. In addition to the judgments discussed above, the following factors also have the potential to impact our assumptions and thus the expected future cash flows and, therefore, our impairment conclusions: general macroeconomic conditions; governmental actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction; changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences; success of planned new product expansions; competitive activity; and income and excise taxes. For further discussion of these factors, see Operating Results by Business Segment - Business Environment below.\n\nWhile our management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset at December 31, 2024 are reasonable, actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.\n\nDuring 2023, our quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nFor further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the impairment charge of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024, see Note 6.\n\n- Investments in E quity Securities: At the end of each reporting period, we review our equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (ABI and Cronos) for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our investments to their carrying value. If the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, we consider the investment impaired, reduce its carrying value to its fair value and record the impairment in the period identified. We use certain factors to make this determination, including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nFor further discussion of our investments in equity securities, see Note 8.\n\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Contingencies: As discussed in Note 20 and Item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various United States and foreign jurisdictions against Altria and certain of our subsidiaries, including PM USA and NJOY, as well as certain respective indemnitees. In 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other U.S. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Tex as and Minnesota (together with the MSA, 'State Settlement Agreements').",

If the carrying value of our investment in ABI exceeds its fair value and we determine that the loss in value is other than temporary, we record appropriate impairment losses. In a prior period, we concluded that the fair value of our investment in ABI declined below the carrying value of our investment in ABI and that this decline in fair value was other than temporary. As a result, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge for that period. It is possible that we may be required to record significant impairment charges in the future and, if we do so, our net earnings and carrying value of our investment in ABI could be materially adversely affected.\n\nIn the event that our ownership percentage in ABI were to decrease below certain levels, (i) we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, (ii) the number of nominees that we have the right to select for election to the ABI board of directors could be reduced and (iii) we may be unable to continue to account for our investment in ABI under the equity method of accounting.\n\n## Our investment in Cronos subjects us to certain risks associated with Cronos's business, including legal, regulatory and reputational risks.\n\nOur investment in Cronos, a Canadian cannabinoid company, subjects us to various risks relating to Cronos's business, such as legal, regulatory and reputational risks. Cronos is engaged in the cultivation, manufacture and marketing of cannabis and cannabis-derived products for the medical and adult-use markets in various international jurisdictions. Accordingly, Cronos's operations are subject to laws, regulations and guidelines promulgated by various governmental authorities. In the United States, these laws include the Controlled Substances Act, the Civil Assets Forfeiture Reform Act (as it relates to violation of the Controlled Substances Act), all related applicable anti-money laundering laws and FDA regulations. A failure by Cronos or Altria to comply with applicable laws, including cannabis laws, could result in criminal, civil or tax  liability, negative impacts on the availability and cost of capital and credit or reputational harm for Altria.\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 1C. Cybersecurity.\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe rely extensively on information technology, much of which is managed by third-party service providers (such as cloud data service providers), to support a variety of business processes and activities, including: complying with regulatory, legal, financial reporting and tax  requirements; engaging in marketing and ecommerce activities; managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations; researching, developing, manufacturing and distributing our products; collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information; and communicating with employees, investors, suppliers, trade customers, adult tobacco consumers and others. Recognizing the critical importance of cybersecurity in today's digital landscape, we are committed to safeguarding our information assets, protecting consumer data and maintaining the integrity and availability of our systems. Accordingly, we have implemented an extensive cybersecurity risk management framework designed to identify, assess, mitigate and prevent potential cybersecurity risks and to align with industry best practices and all applicable regulatory requirements. We leverage the National Institute of Standards and Technology ('NIST') Cybersecurity Framework and industry best practices to identify and prioritize cybersecurity risks based on their potential impacts. We also use the NIST framework and industry best practices to drive enhancements to our program that are designed to protect our assets and third-party partners. The NIST framework also helps us maintain ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements. We align our security standards for infrastructure configuration with the Center for Internet Security's Benchmarks, which are prescriptive recommendations based upon the consensus of global cybersecurity experts.\n\nOur framework is built around the following key principles: (i) risk assessment and threat intelligence; (ii) security controls; (iii) incident response; (iv) employee awareness and training; and (v) third-party risk management. We have integrated our cybersecurity framework into our broad enterprise risk management processes, which allows us to leverage our existing enterprise-wide experience in managing risk and adapting to change in the cybersecurity threat landscape.\n\n- Risk Assessment and Threat Intelligence: We conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats. Our Information Technology ('IT') Risk Management function, overseen by our Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO'), leads internal self-assessments, which involve evaluating the security posture of critical systems, networks and applications as well as the potential impact of cybersecurity threats on our business operations, financial condition and reputation. IT Risk Management also conducts ongoing threat monitoring and has implemented monitoring systems, including technologies such as intrusion detection systems, security information and event management tools and threat intelligence programs.\n\nWe regularly engage third-party consulting services to conduct audits and assessments of the effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls and processes and identify areas for improvement based on developments in industry best practices. We typically engage these services",

These risks could be heightened in light of increased pressure on our suppliers from supply chain challenges. In addition, if another company recalls or experiences negativ e publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their ov erall consumption of products in this category. Any of these ev ents could materially and adv ersely affect our reputation, brands, product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\n\nWe may also suffer losses when our products or operations or those of our suppliers v iolate applicable laws or regulations, or when our or our suppliers' products cause injury, illness or death.  In addition, our marketing could face claims of false or deceptiv e adv ertising or other criticism. A significant product liability or related claim or other legal judgment against us, a regulatory enforcement action, a widespread product recall or comments relating to the safety of our products could materially and adv ersely affect our reputation and profitability. Moreov er, ev en if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim, litigation or inv estigation has no merit, is not pursued or is unsuccessful, the negativ e publicity surrounding assertions against our products or  processes or conduct could materially and adv ersely affect our reputation, brands, product sales, product inv entory, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and we could incur significant expense responding to such a claim, litigation or inv estigation. For example, a recent purported personal injury lawsuit filed against a number of food companies, including us ( Bryce Martinez vs. Kraft Heinz Co. Inc. et al. ), alleged that certain food products we and other companies make are addictiv e and cause health problems. While we believ e that this lawsuit is without merit and intend to v igorously defend ourselv es, we cannot predict the outcome or the impact of such litigation or similar lawsuits on our business or reputation. In addition, while we currently maintain insurance cov erage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of product recalls, this insurance cov erage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cov er all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident.\n\n## We face risks related to legal or tax claims, litigation, investigations or other regulatory enforcement actions.\n\nWe operate around the world in env ironments with constantly ev olv ing legal, tax and regulatory frameworks, and we are subject to risk of litigation, legal or tax claims, inv estigations, or other regulatory enforcement actions. Actions by our employees, contractors, agents or others in v iolation of our policies and procedures could lead to deficiencies in our internal or other controls or v iolations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. We could also be subject to litigation, legal claims, inv estigations or regulatory actions in connection with the continued ev olution of our sustainability and ESG-related initiativ es.  In  addition,  we  may  be  impacted  by  litigation  trends,  including  class  action,  indiv idual  or  multi-jurisdiction  lawsuits,  or  inv estigations  or enforcement actions inv olv ing consumers, employees, shareholders or other stakeholders. For example, as a global snacking company, we are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and face legal challenges in a v ariety of jurisdictions concerning the alleged health implications of certain food products and our methods in marketing those products. When litigation, legal or tax claims, inv estigations or regulatory enforcement actions arise out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or controls, we could be subject to civ il and criminal penalties, and v oluntary and inv oluntary document requests, that could materially and adv ersely affect our reputation, product sales, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows  and  stock  price.  Ev en  if  a  claim,  lawsuit,  inv estigation,  enforcement  action  or  other  action  is  unsuccessful,  without  merit  or  not  pursued  to completion, the reputational impact or cost of responding to such a claim, including expenses and management time, could adv ersely affect us.

The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 48 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\n\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 48 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\n\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ('Coca-Cola FEMSA'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (nationwide), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica (nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country), Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (a major part of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the state of Paran\u00e1, the state of Santa Catarina, part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, part of the state of Goi\u00e1s and part of the state of Rio de Janeiro), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas) and Uruguay (nationwide);\n- Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\n- Coca-Cola HBC AG ('Coca-Cola Hellenic'), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\n- Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and parts of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\n- Swire Beverages, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai Municipality in the eastern and southern areas of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and territories in 13 states in the western United States.\n\nIn 2021, these five bottling partners combined represented 41 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\n\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\n\n## Bottler's Agreements\n\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as 'bottler's agreements,' with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler's agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\n\nWhile under most of our bottler's agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company's ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\n\nAs further discussed below, our bottler's agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler's agreements for territories within the United States.",

Uncertainty about the effect of the Fertin Pharma Acquisition and the Vectura acquisition on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies of each of Fertin Pharma and Vectura, may have a material adverse effect on us and/or the businesses that we have acquired with the proposed Acquisitions. Customers, suppliers and others who do business with Fertin Pharma  or  Vectura  may  delay  or  defer  business  decisions,  decide  to  terminate,  modify  or  renegotiate  their  relationships,  or  take  other actions as a result of our acquisitions of Fertin Pharma and Vectura, respectively, which could negatively affect the revenues, earnings and cash flows of our company or the businesses that we have acquired with these Acquisitions. If we are unable to maintain the business and operational relationships of Fertin Pharma and/or Vectura, our financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon combining with these companies could be adversely affected.\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 2 . Properties.\n\nWe own or lease various manufacturing, office and research and development facilities in locations primarily outside the United States. We own properties in Switzerland where our operations center and state-of-the-art research and development facility are located.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we operated and owned a total of 39 manufacturing facilities across our six geographical segments and other category. Among them, 7 factories produced heated tobacco units.\n\nIn  2021,  certain  facilities  each  manufactured  over  30  billion  units  (cigarettes  and  heated  tobacco  units  combined).  The  largest manufacturing facilities, in terms of volume, are located in Russia (EE), Indonesia (S&amp;SA), Turkey (ME&amp;A), Poland (EU), the Philippines (S&amp;SA),  Italy  (EU),  Lithuania  (EU)  and  Portugal  (EU). As  part  of  our  global  operating  model,  products  manufactured  in  a  particular manufacturing facility are not necessarily distributed in the operating segment where the facility is located.\n\nWe  have  integrated  the  production  of  our  heated  tobacco  units  into  a  number  of  our  existing  manufacturing  facilities,  and  we  are progressing with our plans to build manufacturing capacity for our other RRP platforms. We will continue to optimize our manufacturing infrastructure.\n\nWe believe the properties owned or leased by our subsidiaries are maintained in good condition and are believed to be suitable and adequate for our present needs.\n\n## Item 3.

      "answer": "The proposed global minimum tax rate of 15% under the OECD's Pillar Two Framework could increase both Altria\u2019s and PepsiCo\u2019s effective tax rates. Altria, which earned $10,971 million in the U.S. in 2023 and paid $2,346 million in federal taxes, may face a higher U.S. tax burden if the legislation is enacted domestically. Similarly, PepsiCo, which operates globally and is subject to tax changes in multiple jurisdictions, could see its tax liabilities rise as countries implement the minimum tax, particularly in the EU where it is expected to take effect as early as 2024. Both companies would likely experience increased compliance costs and potential adjustments to their tax provisions.",
