      "question": "How does the use of valuation models incorporating broker/dealer quotes impact the fair value determination of Level 2 assets for GD compared to BA's approach for available-for-sale debt investments?",
      "answer": "GD determines the fair value of its Level 2 fixed-income securities using valuation models that incorporate observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets and broker/dealer quotes. Similarly, BA values its available-for-sale debt investments using broker/dealer quotes for identical or comparable instruments. Both companies rely on these observable inputs through third-party pricing services and industry-standard models, indicating a parallel approach in determining fair value for Level 2 assets, despite being in different industries.",

The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income-based and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate the fair value. These inputs include reported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the same or similar securities, issuer credit spreads, benchmark securities, prepayment/default projections based on historical data and other observable inputs.\n\n## Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts\n\nOur foreign currency derivative contracts have maturities of 18 months or less and all are with counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A- or equivalent by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, Inc. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by utilizing an income-based industry standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR') and swap rates. These inputs, where applicable, are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n\n## Level 3 Inputs\n\n## Contingent Consideration Liability\n\nIn connection with our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR G mbH ('MYR'), we are subject to a potential contingent consideration payment of up to \u20ac300 million, subject to customary adjustments, which is revalued each reporting period using probability-weighted scenarios for U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA') approval of Hepcludex until the related contingency is resolved.\n\nThe following table summarizes the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liability:\n\n",

      "answer": "GD reports $7 million in real estate funds as of December 31, 2023, measured using NAV as a practical expedient. Similarly, UPS relies on NAV to value its U.S. pension and postretirement medical benefit plans' investments in real estate funds, which totaled $9.9 billion as of December 31, 2023. However, UPS emphasizes the subjective nature of NAV estimation due to the lack of active trading, requiring adjustments based on audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers. This highlights that while both companies use NAV for valuing real estate funds, UPS's approach involves more complex and subjective assumptions due to the larger scale and nature of its investments.",

      "answer": "GD uses valuation models incorporating observable inputs like interest rates and bond yields to determine the fair value of its Level 2 assets, which include fixed-income securities and cash flow hedges. These models are part of a market approach and are used when quoted prices for identical assets are unavailable. In contrast, GE invests $939 million in real estate funds as of December 31, 2023, which are measured at net asset value (NAV) per share as a practical expedient, a method that does not rely on active market trading but instead on periodic appraisals and valuation models used by the funds themselves. Both approaches involve indirect valuation techniques, but GD's is more directly controlled and model-driven, while GE's depends on the fund's own valuation practices.",

      "answer": "BA invests in retail properties as part of its broader real estate and real assets portfolio, which includes global private investments often held through LPs or other fund structures. Retail properties are specifically called out as a component of Real Estate Funds, which are typically illiquid and not redeemable due to their closed-end nature, as noted in the MS_10k_2024 document. UPS also holds exposure to real estate funds as part of its pension and postretirement plan assets, valued at $10.1 billion as of December 31, 2024. These funds, like those of BA, are primarily measured using NAV due to their non-trading nature, highlighting a shared liquidity risk stemming from the illiquid structure of the Real Estate Funds that both companies depend on for real estate exposure.",

Changes in the fix ed income, foreign currency ex change and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. Further information on our accounting policies relating to fair value measurements can be found in note 1 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the majority of our financial instruments were categorized as either Level 1 or Level 2. Refer to notes 3, 9 and 17 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for further information on these instruments. A quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates is presented in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk section of this report.\n\nOur pension and postretirement plan assets include investments in hedge funds, as well as private debt, private equity and real estate funds, which are primarily measured using net asset value (\"NAV\") as a practical expedient for fair value, as appropriate. These investments were valued at $10.1 billion as of December 31, 2024. In order to estimate NAV, we evaluate audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers and make adjustments for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. These investments are not actively traded, and their values can only be estimated using these assumptions. If our estimates of activity changed, this could have a material impact on the reported value of these investments and on the return on assets that we report. Refer to note 5 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for further information on our pension and postretirement plan assets.\n\nCertain non-financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. These assets are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of an impairment or when an asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale.\n\nIn accounting for business acquisitions, we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment, especially with respect to identified intangible assets as there may be limited or no observable transactions within the market, requiring us to develop internal models to estimate fair value. For ex ample, estimating the fair value of identified intangible assets may require us to develop valuation assumptions, including but not limited to, future expected cash flows from these assets, synergies and the cost of capital. Certain inputs require us to determine assumptions that are reflective of a market participant view of fair value. Changes in any of these assumptions may materially impact the amount we recognize for identifiable assets and liabilities, in addition to the residual amount allocated to goodwill.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense within our financial statements. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction, tax  credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of deferred tax  assets and liabilities arising from timing differences in the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as tax, interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax ex pense in a subsequent period.\n\nWe assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we increase our provision for tax es by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax  assets recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely.\n\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex  tax  regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. Once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from positions filed or to be filed with the tax authorities is recorded as a liability for uncertain tax  benefits. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate uncertain tax positions quarterly based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity.

          "chunk_text": "## HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts)\n\n## CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE\n\nThe Company capitalizes costs of software developed or obtained for internal use during the application development stage of a project and amortizes those costs using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of the software, not to exceed seven years. Costs incurred during the preliminary and postimplementation  stages  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Development  costs  for  software  held  for  sale  are  capitalized  once  a  project  has  reached  the  point  of technological feasibility . Completed projects are amortized after reaching the point of general availability using the straight-line method based on the expected useful life, not to ex ceed seven years. A t each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of an impairment exists, the Company evaluates the recoverability of unamortized capitalized software costs based on estimated future undiscounted revenues net of estimated related costs over the remaining amortization period. Capitalized software held for internal use and held for sale is included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\n\nAssets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs, and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of A ccumulated other comprehensive loss. For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property , plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings.\n\n## DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nAll deriv ativ e financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair v alue of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated  as  cash  flow  hedges,  the  changes  in  fair  value  of  the  derivatives  are  recorded  in A ccumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  and  subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings.\n\nDerivative financial instruments designated as hedges must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception and over the life of the hedge contract. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. The Company elected to exclude the time value of the derivatives (i.e., the forward points) from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and to recognize the initial value of the excluded component in earnings using the amortization approach. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the gain or loss is reported as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) and recorded in A ccumulated other comprehensive loss. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.\n\n## LEASES\n\nAt the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The assessment is based on (i) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (ii) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (iii) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\nAll  significant  lease  arrangements  are  generally  recognized  at  lease  commencement.  Operating  lease  right-of-use  (ROU)  assets  and  lease  liabilities  are recognized at commencement. A n ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (short-term leases); however, lease expense for these leases is recognized as incurred over the lease term.\n\nROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.\n\nOperating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease payments may be fixed or variable, however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are included in determining the lease liability . V ariable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments related to initial direct costs and prepayments and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately.\n\n59 Honeywell International Inc.",

Similarly, GE evaluated the impact of LIBOR cessation under ASU 2020-04 and also concluded that the overall effect on its financial statements was immaterial. Both companies leveraged the optional expedients provided under the standard to ease the transition away from legacy reference rates without significant financial adjustments.",

      "answer": "FDX has not experienced a material effect from reference rate reform as of May 31, 2024, but continues to monitor contracts under ASU 2020-04, which allows optional expedients for contracts referencing LIBOR or other discontinued rates through December 31, 2024. Meanwhile, CAT actively uses interest rate contracts, including fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, to manage exposure to interest rate changes. The extension of ASU 2020-04 through 2024 provides both companies with continued flexibility in managing legacy contracts affected by the discontinuation of LIBOR, though CAT\u2019s structured hedging relationships suggest a more proactive financial risk management strategy.",

      "answer": "CAT formally documents and designates derivatives as either fair value or cash flow hedges, using foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage up to five years of anticipated foreign currency cash flow exposure. Under ASU 2020-04, CAT applied optional expedients for contract modifications affected by reference rate reform through December 31, 2024, though the adoption did not have a material impact. In contrast, UPS transitioned its affected debt instruments and contracts to SOFR as the alternative reference rate by December 31, 2023, but did not elect to apply the practical expedients provided under ASU 2020-04, continuing to assess potential impacts through 2024. Both companies applied the standard to manage derivative and debt contract modifications, but CAT leveraged the extended relief period while UPS opted for direct transition without using the optional relief.",

      "answer": "The deferral of the sunset date of ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, via ASU 2022-06, allowed both UPS and FedEx to extend their evaluation and application of reference rate reform accounting relief. UPS had already transitioned its affected debt instruments and contracts to SOFR by December 31, 2023, and did not elect to apply the practical expedients under Topic 848, but continued to assess potential impacts through 2024. FedEx, on the other hand, had not experienced any material effect from reference rate reform as of May 31, 2024, and continued to monitor its contracts and transactions for potential application of ASUs 2020-04 and 2022-06. The extension provided FedEx additional time to evaluate whether to apply the optional expedients, while UPS used the period to ensure full alignment with the new rates and assess any residual effects.",

      "answer": "RTX manages its customer financing obligations by leveraging its strong liquidity position, including $7.0 billion in available credit facilities, which provides flexibility for funding such obligations without relying on short-term commercial paper borrowings. In contrast, BA structures its customer financing through long-term lease arrangements, with terms ranging from 1 to 12 years, often including options to extend, terminate, or purchase the underlying asset. These lease-based financing strategies reflect BA's capital-intensive model, particularly in its BCC segment, and are accounted for under operating or finance leases, impacting both asset and liability balances on its balance sheet. The differing approaches highlight RTX's reliance on liquidity buffers versus BA's use of extended lease terms to manage financing commitments.",

Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect  our  overall  management  of  liquidity  include:  capital  expenditures,  customer  financing  requirements,  investments  in  and divestitures  of  businesses,  dividends,  common  stock  repurchases,  pension  funding,  access  to  the  commercial  paper  markets, adequacy of available bank lines of credit, redemptions of debt and the ability to attract long-term capital at satisfactory terms. We had $7.0 billion available under our various credit facilities at December 31, 2021.\n\nAlthough our business has been and will continue to be impacted by COVID-19, we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the potential impacts.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had Cash and cash equivalents of $7.8 billion, of which approximately 34% was held by RTC's foreign subsidiaries.  We  manage  our  worldwide  cash  requirements  by  reviewing  available  funds  among  the  many  subsidiaries  through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The Company does not intend to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the U.S. Taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings have been recorded. For the remainder of the Company's undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, RTC will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings.\n\nHistorically, our strong credit ratings and financial position have enabled us to issue long-term debt at favorable market rates.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was $5.0 billion as the commercial paper is backed by our $5.0 billion revolving credit agreement. We had no commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2021. The daily average amount of short-term commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $175 million. We use  our  commercial  paper  borrowings  for  general  corporate  purposes,  including  the  funding  of  potential  acquisitions,  pension contributions,  debt  refinancing,  dividend  payments  and  repurchases  of  our  common  stock.  The  commercial  paper  notes  have original maturities of not more than 90 days from the date of issuance.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had revolving credit agreements with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $7.0 billion, consisting of a $5.0 billion revolving credit agreement, which matures in April 2025, and a $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement,  which  we  renewed  in  May  2021  and  expires  in  May  2022. As  of  December  31,  2021,  there  were  no  borrowings outstanding under these agreements.\n\nWe have an existing universal shelf registration statement, which we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on September  27,  2019,  for  an  indeterminate  amount  of  debt  and  equity  securities  for  future  issuance,  subject  to  our  internal limitations on the amount of debt to be issued under this shelf registration statement.\n\nThe  Company  offers  a  voluntary  supply  chain  finance  (SCF)  program  with  a  global  financial  institution  which  enables  our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to the financial institution at a rate that leverages our credit rating, which might be beneficial to them. Our suppliers' participation in the SCF program does not impact or change our terms and conditions with those suppliers, and therefore, we have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the program. In addition, we provide no guarantees or otherwise pay for any of the costs of the program incurred by those suppliers that choose to participate, and have no direct financial relationship with the financial institution, as it relates to the program. As such, the SCF program does not impact our overall liquidity.\n\nWe believe our cash on hand and future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Further, we continue to have access to the commercial paper markets and our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain debt or",

The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years' digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over 5 years. Capitalized software as a service is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line  method  over  the  term  of  the  hosting  arrangement,  which  is  typically  no  greater  than  10  years.  We  periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.\n\nLong-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.\n\nLeases We determine if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at the inception date. Operating leases are included in Other  assets,  with  the  related  liabilities  included  in  Accrued  liabilities  and  Other  long-term  liabilities.  Assets  under finance leases, which primarily represent computer equipment, are included in Property, plant and equipment, net, with the  related  liabilities  included  in  Short-term  debt  and  current  portion  of  long-term  debt  and  Long-term  debt  on  the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\nOperating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. Variable components of the lease payments such as fair market value adjustments, utilities and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and not included in determining the present value. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe have real property lease agreements with lease and non-lease components which are accounted for as a single lease component.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe  record  all  known  asset  retirement  obligations  for  which  the  liability's  fair  value  can  be  reasonably  estimated, including  certain  asbestos  removal,  asset  decommissioning  and  contractual  lease  restoration  obligations.  Recorded amounts are not material.\n\nWe  also  have  known  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations,  such  as  certain  asbestos  remediation  and  asset decommissioning  activities  to  be  performed  in  the  future,  that  are  not  reasonably  estimable  due  to  insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the  liability's  fair  value.  In  addition,  there  may  be  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations  that  we  have  not  yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of",

Both companies utilized third-party insurers to offload long-term liabilities\u2014UPS for workers' compensation claims from policy years 2001\u20132006 and 2017, and LMT for defined benefit pension plans.

      "answer": "LMT faces increased operational risk due to potential fraud in fixed-price development contracts where cost overruns can significantly impact margins and profitability. This risk is compounded by government audits that may uncover improper activities, leading to penalties or reputational harm. Operational risk, which includes fraud, is explicitly recognized in financial services contexts like those outlined in MS_10k, where it is defined as risks from failed internal processes, human factors, or external events. BA's pension asset risk management framework directly incorporates operational risk oversight, with specific procedures for counterparty credit parameters, valuation controls, and asset class diversification. This shows that while LMT's operational risk stems from contract execution and regulatory exposure, BA actively structures its pension investment strategy to manage such risks through defined governance and diversification protocols.",

When this occurs, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is evident.\n\nUnder both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, if we are unable to control costs, our operating results could be adversely affected. Costs to complete a contract may increase for many reasons, including technical and manufacturing challenges, schedule delays, workforce-related issues, inaccurate initial contract cost estimates, the timeliness and availability of materials from suppliers, internal and subcontractor performance or product quality issues, inability to meet cost reduction initiatives or achieve efficiencies from digital transformation, changing laws or regulations, inflation and natural disasters. Certain contracts may impose other risks, such as forfeiting fees, paying penalties, or providing replacement systems in the event of performance failure.\n\nContracts for development programs include complex design and technical requirements and are often contracted on a cost-reimbursable basis, however, some of our  existing  development  programs  are  contracted  on  a  fix ed-price  basis.  In  addition,  we  have  certain  contracts  where  we  bid  upfront  on  cost-reimbursable development work and the follow-on fixed-price production options in one submission. We expect we also will bid on similar programs in the future. Fixed-price development work or fixed-price production options, especially on competitively bid programs, is inherently riskier than cost-reimbursable work because the revenue is  fix ed,  while  the  estim ates  of  costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant variability due to the nature of development programs. The technical complexity coupled with the fixed-price contract structure of certain of our ongoing development programs or new programs increases the risk that our costs will be greater than anticipated, resulting in reduced margins, operating profit, or reach-forward losses during the period of contract performance or upon contract award, all of which could be significant to our financial condition and operating results. Bidding upfront on fixed-price production options increases the risk that we may experience lower margins than expected, or a loss, on the production options because we must estimate the cost of producing a product before it has been  developed.  These  risks  may  cause  us  not  to  bid  on  certain  future  programs,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  future  growth  prospects  and  financial performance. See Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details about losses incurred on certain programs, including fixed-price development programs.\n\nContracts for the transition from development to production (e.g., low rate initial production (LRIP) contracts) also create performance and financial risks to our business because of the challenge of starting and stabilizing a manufacturing production and test line while concurrently validating final design and managing change in requirements or capabilities requested by the customer.\n\nMany of our contracts include multiple option years exercisable at the customer's discretion, which carries risk. The customer may decline to exercise an option, or the customer may exercise an option on a contract for which we expect to incur a loss or perform at a low margin, either of which could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nWe are routinely subject to audit by our customers on government contracts, including audits relating to our disclosed Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) rate structure or any changes to our CAS rate structure and the results of those audits could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations\n\nU.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency and various agency Inspectors G eneral, routinely  audit  and  investigate  government  contractors.  These  agencies  review  a  contractor's  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and  contract  terms, regarding, among other things, contract pricing, contract performance, cost structure and business systems. U.S. G overnment audits and investigations often take years to complete, and many result in no adverse action against us. Like many U.S. G overnment contractors, we have received audit and investigative reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices or that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts. Similarly, like other U.S. G overnment contractors, audits and investigations also occur related to cost reimbursements that are based upon our final allowable incurred costs for each year. We have unaudited or unsettled incurred cost claims related to past years, which limits our ability to issue final billings on contracts for which authorized and appropriated funds may be expiring or can result in delays in final billings and our ability to close out a contract. These audits could result in unanticipated changes to contract prices and the amount and timing of payments, which could affect profitability and cash flows for any particular reporting period. These changes could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in such period.\n\nIf  an  audit  or  investigation  uncovers  improper  or  illegal  activities,  we  may  be  subject  to  civil  or  criminal  penalties  and  administrative  sanctions,  including reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, repayments, penalties, fines or suspension or  debarment from doing business with the U.S. G overnment.  Reductions in the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, repayments, penalties, and fines could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in any particular reporting period, and suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our dependence on contracts with the U.S. G overnment. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Similar government oversight and risks to our business and reputation exist in most other countries where we conduct business.",

      "answer": "Arkansas was one of several states, including Nebraska, Iowa, and Kansas, that enacted legislation to reduce corporate income tax rates, resulting in a $114 million reduction in Union Pacific's deferred tax expense for 2023. This represents a direct, immediate financial benefit tied to tax policy in Arkansas, where Union Pacific operates a major classification yard in North Little Rock. In contrast, GE faces potential future financial exposure from possible legislation in Poland related to foreign currency-indexed mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2023, GE estimated total losses for borrower litigation at Bank BPH to be $2,669 million, with the potential for further increases depending on judicial decisions and legislative actions. While the Arkansas tax legislation provided a defined benefit, the potential Polish legislation could significantly amplify GE's liabilities, highlighting differing regulatory risk profiles shaped by legislative environments in Arkansas and Poland.",

      "question": "How did the application of ASU 2020-04 to contract modifications impact UPS's revenue recognition timing compared to FDX's exposure to reference rate reform adjustments during fiscal 2023?",
      "answer": "UPS applied contract modifications under ASC 606, recognizing revenue for package delivery contracts using the cost-to-cost measure and for logistics services based on the right to invoice, with modifications treated prospectively if they did not add distinct services. ASU 2020-04 allowed FDX to apply optional expedients for reference rate reform, particularly for contracts referencing LIBOR, reducing the burden of contract modifications related to rate transitions. FDX reported no material effect from reference rate reform as of May 31, 2024, indicating minimal disruption to its revenue or financial reporting. Therefore, while UPS's revenue recognition timing was directly influenced by how contract modifications were accounted for prospectively, FDX experienced minimal operational or financial impact from applying ASU 2020-04 to its affected contracts during fiscal 2023.",

        "Hop 1: UPS \u2192 Contract Modifications: UPS recognizes revenue using cost-to-cost or output methods and accounts for contract modifications prospectively if they don't add distinct services.",

      "answer": "FDX has not experienced a material effect from reference rate reform, including ASU 2020-04, as of May 31, 2024, and continues to monitor its contracts for potential application of the standard, which now extends through December 31, 2024. ASU 2020-04 allows entities to apply optional expedients and exceptions for contracts referencing LIBOR or other discontinued rates, reducing the complexity of contract modifications. Meanwhile, BA faces significant contract modification risks due to its reliance on U.S. government contracts, which accounted for 37% of its 2023 revenues. These contracts can be modified, curtailed, or terminated at the government\u2019s convenience or due to funding changes, potentially leading to financial exposure such as withheld payments or asset write-downs. Therefore, while FDX benefits from temporary accounting relief that simplifies LIBOR-related contract adjustments, BA\u2019s contract modifications stem from external regulatory and funding dynamics that pose more direct financial and operational risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: FDX \u2192 ASU 2020-04: FDX is subject to ASU 2020-04 and its extension through ASU 2022-06, which provides optional relief for contract modifications related to reference rate reform (e.g., LIBOR), with no material effect observed as of May 31, 2024.",
        "Hop 2: ASU 2020-04 \u2192 Contract Modifications: ASU 2020-04 facilitates contract modifications related to reference rate reform by offering optional expedients and exceptions, effective through December 31, 2024, reducing operational and accounting burdens.",
        "Hop 3: Contract Modifications \u2190 BA: BA is significantly exposed to contract modifications due to its reliance on U.S. government contracts (37% of 2023 revenues), which can be altered or terminated unilaterally and are subject to funding volatility, posing material financial risks."

      "answer": "FDX applies the NAV practical expedient to certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values, with unrealized gains and losses of $14 million, ($48 million), and $60 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively, and reports these using the measurement alternative with adjustments for observable price changes and impairments. Real estate funds, which are recorded using the NAV practical expedient, rely on valuation models and periodic appraisals, typically with terms of 8 to 10 years and redemption windows generally within 90 days. In contrast, GE holds $1,410 million (as of December 31, 2024) in real estate funds through its run-off insurance operations, which are measured at net asset value per share as a practical expedient, are generally not eligible for redemption, and are considered illiquid, with distributions dependent on the liquidation of underlying assets at the discretion of the general partner. While both entities use the NAV practical expedient, FDX\u2019s investments are more liquid and subject to periodic fair value adjustments, whereas GE\u2019s are longer-term, less liquid, and lack a standardized redemption mechanism.",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $990 million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024.

Fair value adjustments, including impairments, recorded in earnings were $159 million and $70 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and insignificant for December 31, 2022. These are primarily limited partnership investments in private equity, infrastructure and real estate funds that are measured at net asset value per share (or equivalent) as a practical expedient to estimated fair value and are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. These limited partnership investments are generally not eligible for redemption and generally cannot be sold without approval of the general partner. Distribution from each fund will be received as the underlying investments of the funds are liquidated at the discretion of the general partner. These investments are generally considered illiquid and our ability to receive the most recent net asset value in a sale would be determined by external market factors.\n\nOur run-off insurance operations have approximately $700 million of assets held by states or other regulatory bodies in statutorily required deposit accounts, and approximately $29,800 million of assets held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts and reinsurance security trust agreements in place between either Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) or Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC) as the reinsuring entity and a number of ceding insurers. Assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contracts and trust agreements. Some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of ERA C or UFLIC which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.",

      "answer": "Boeing reported equity income of $125 million from ULA in 2024, reflecting its stake in the joint venture. ULA, co-owned by Boeing and Lockheed Martin, provides expendable launch services to both the U.S. Government and commercial customers. Lockheed Martin\u2019s Space segment includes revenue from commercial satellite launches facilitated through ULA. Additionally, Lockheed Martin reported $665 million in receivables from commercial customers as of December 31, 2024, which includes payments related to ULA\u2019s commercial launch services. Therefore, Boeing\u2019s equity income from ULA is directly tied to the revenue Lockheed Martin recognizes from commercial satellite launches via ULA\u2019s dual customer base.",

Net unfav orable cumulativ e contract catch-up adjustments were $2,328 million better than in 2022.\n\nSee further discussion of fixed-price contracts in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nBDS loss from operations includes our share of income from equity method inv estments of $125 million, $44 million and $13 million primarily from our United Launch Alliance and other joint v entures in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely.\n\n## Backlog\n\nT otal backlog of $64,023 million at December 31, 2024 was $5,011 million higher than December 31, 2023, reflecting the timing of awards, partially offset by rev enue recognized on contracts awarded in prior periods.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nOur BDS business includes a variety of dev elopment programs which hav e complex design and technical challenges. Some of these programs hav e cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily reduced award or incentiv e fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\n\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Examples of significant fixed-price dev elopment programs include Commercial Crew,  KC-46A  T anker,  MQ-25,  T -7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B,  and  commercial  and  military  satellites. A  number  of  our  ongoing  fixed-price  dev elopment programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also hav e risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during dev elopment, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result  in  a  material  charge  or  otherwise  adv ersely  affect  our  financial  condition.  T hese  programs  are  ongoing,  and  while  we  believ e  the  cost  and  fee estimates  incorporated  in  the  financial  statements  are  appropriate,  the  technical  complexity  of  these  programs  creates  financial  risk  as  additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled deliv ery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination prov isions or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\n\n## Global Services\n\n## Business Environment and Trends\n\nThe aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics and other inv entory serv ices; maintenance, engineering and upgrades; training and professional  serv ices;  and  data  analytics  and  digital  serv ices.  We  expect  BGS  commercial  rev enues  to  remain  strong  in  future  quarters  as  the commercial airline industry transitions from recov ery to growth.\n\nOver  the  long-term,  as  the  size  of  the  worldwide  commercial  airline  fleet  continues  to  grow ,  so  does  demand  for  aftermarket  serv ices  designed  to increase efficiency and extend the economic liv es of aircraft. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictiv e maintenance to improve their productiv ity and efficiency. Airlines continue to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inv entory, frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties.",

      "question": "Given Lockheed Martin's exposure to U.S. government contract termination risks and potential funding shortfalls for termination costs, how might this specifically affect FedEx's revenue from USPS, considering that FedEx's domestic air transportation contract with USPS expires in September 2024 and UPS also competes for USPS logistics services?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin faces risks from U.S. government contract terminations, including scenarios where programs lack sufficient funds to cover termination costs (LMT_10k_2022.pdf). FedEx relies heavily on USPS, which is its largest customer for domestic air transportation services, with the contract set to expire in September 2024 (FDX_10k_2022.pdf). If government budget constraints are exacerbated by prior un-funded termination costs from companies like Lockheed Martin, USPS could face tighter budgets that accelerate its efforts to reduce reliance on air transportation providers like FedEx or delay contract renewals. This would directly impact FedEx's revenue. Meanwhile, UPS also competes for USPS logistics services, and any reduction in USPS spending could benefit UPS if it secures a larger share of remaining contracts (UPS_10k_2022.pdf). Thus, Lockheed Martin's contract risks could indirectly influence FedEx's future revenue from USPS and UPS's competitive positioning in the government logistics market.",

        "Hop 1: LMT \u2192 Contract Termination: Lockheed Martin explicitly states that U.S. government contracts may be terminated without sufficient funding to cover termination costs, creating financial risk for the company.",

        "Hop 3: USPS \u2190 UPS: UPS competes with FedEx for USPS logistics contracts, meaning any reduction in USPS spending or shift in service providers could alter the competitive dynamics between the two logistics giants."

We also may not be successful in making hardware and software upgrades and other modernization capabilities in a timely manner, including as a result of dependencies on suppliers, which could increase costs and create  schedule  delays.  Our  ability  to  capture  and  retain  future  F-35  growth  in  development,  production  and  sustainment  is dependent  on  the  success  of  our  efforts  to  achieve  F-35  sustainment  performance,  customer  affordability,  supply  chain improvements, continued reliability improvements and other efficiencies, some of which are outside our control.\n\n## We are subject to procurement laws and regulations, including those that enable the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience. Our business and reputation could be adversely affected if we or those we do business with fail to comply with these laws.\n\nWe  must  comply  with  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  the  award,  administration  and  performance  of  U.S.  Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and impose certain risks and costs on our business. A violation of these laws and regulations by us, our employees, others working on our behalf, a supplier or a joint venture partner could harm our reputation and result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, suspension or debarment from bidding on or being awarded contracts, loss of our ability to export products or perform services and civil  or  criminal  investigations  or  proceedings.  In  addition,  costs  to  comply  with  new  government  regulations  can  increase  our costs, reduce our margins and affect our competitiveness.\n\nGovernment contract laws and regulations  can  impose  terms  or  obligations  that  are  different  than  those  typically  found  in commercial transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts not only for  default  based  on  our  performance  but  also  at  its  convenience.  Upon  termination  for  convenience  of  a  fixed-price  type contract, typically we are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-inprocess and an allowance for profit on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost-reimbursable contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee, and allowable costs include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. Programs occasionally do not have sufficient funds appropriated to cover the termination costs if the government were to terminate them for convenience. Under such circumstances, the U.S. Government could assert that it is not required to appropriate additional funding.\n\nA termination arising out of our default may expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for  future  contracts  and  orders.  In  addition,  the  U.S.  Government  could  terminate  a  prime  contract  under  which  we  are  a subcontractor,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  our  performance  and  the  quality  of  the  products  or  services  we  delivered  were consistent with our contractual obligations as a subcontractor. In the case of termination for default, the U.S. Government could make claims to reduce the contract value or recover its procurement costs and could assess other special penalties.\n\nOur programs for the U.S. Government often operate for periods of time under Undefinitized Contract Actions (UCAs), which means that we begin performing our obligations before the terms, specifications or price are finally agreed to between the parties. The U.S. Government has (and has exercised in the past) the ability to unilaterally definitize contracts, which, absent a successful appeal,  obligates  us  to  perform  under  terms  and  conditions  imposed  by  the  U.S.  Government.  This  can  affect  our  ability  to negotiate mutually agreeable contract terms and, if a contract is unilaterally imposed upon us, it may negatively affect our expected profit and cash flows on a program or impose burdensome terms.\n\nCertain  of  our  U.S.  Government  contracts  span  one  or  more  base  years  and  include  multiple  option  years.  The  U.S. Government  may  decide  not  to  exercise  option  periods,  which  could  result  in  a  loss  of  expected  sales  or  profits.  The  U.S. Government also may decide to exercise option periods for contracts under which it is expected that our costs may exceed the contract price or ceiling, which could result in losses or unreimbursed costs.\n\n## Evolving U.S. Government procurement policies, increased emphasis on cost over performance and rapid acquisition initiatives could adversely affect our business.\n\nThe U.S. Government could implement procurement policies that negatively impact our profitability or the ability to win new business.  Changes  in  procurement  policy  favoring  more  incentive-based  fee  arrangements,  different  award  fee  criteria  or government contract negotiation offers based upon the customer's view of what our costs should be (as compared to our actual costs) may affect the predictability of our profit rates or make it more difficult to compete on certain types of programs. In addition, changes in contract financing policy for  fixed-price  contracts,  such  as  changes  in  performance  and  progress  payments  policies, including a reversal or modification of the DoD's March 2020 increase to the applicable progress payment rate from 80% to 90%, could significantly affect the timing of our cash flows. Our customers also may seek to negotiate non-traditional contract provisions or  contract  types.  The  U.S.  Government's  preference  for  fixed-price  contracting  has  resulted  in  what  we  believe  to  be  the inappropriate application of fixed-priced contracting methods to development programs.

As technology, customer behavior, and market conditions continue to evolve, it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and service offerings to our customers. If we are not able to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences, our future financial results will suffer. For additional discussion, see 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report under the caption 'Strategy.'\n\nWe may not be able to achieve our fiscal 2025 financial performance goals. In June 2022, we announced that FedEx is targeting certain financial performance goals for fiscal 2025. Our ability to achieve these goals is dependent on a number of factors, including the other risk factors described in this section. If we are not able to achieve these goals, the price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\n\nWe depend on our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand. The FedEx brand name symbolizes high-quality service, reliability, and speed. FedEx is one of the most widely recognized, trusted, and respected brands in the world, and the FedEx brand is one of our most important and valuable assets. In addition, we have a strong reputation among customers, team members, and the general public for high standards of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethics. The FedEx brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sales and marketing and recruitment tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our team members or others with whom we do business, such as customer service mishaps, accidents, catastrophes, or incidents involving aircraft, vehicles, or facilities operated by us; low service or safety levels; data breaches or technology infrastructure disruptions; noncompliance with laws; the shipment of certain items pursuant to our obligation as a common carrier operating under federal law; our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, or marketing programs; or our executive compensation practices could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. With the increase in the use of social media outlets such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly without context, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. Further, our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation with certain groups, including our customers and team members. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and/or create difficulties in retaining and recruiting employee talent, and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.\n\nChanges in the business or financial soundness of the USPS, including strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air network of FedEx Express, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The USPS is the largest customer of FedEx Express, which provides domestic air transportation services for the USPS's First Class Mail, Priority Mail Express, and Priority Mail and transportation and delivery for the USPS's international delivery service. See 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report under 'FedEx Express Segment' for more information.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the USPS. Additionally, the USPS continues to experience budgetary uncertainty as well as increased political debate regarding potential privatization or restructuring of its operations. The USPS is currently implementing strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air networks of FedEx Express and other transportation providers, which negatively impacted our results of operations in 2022. The difficulties discussed above or additional changes in the USPS's business, including its ability to access capital or any structural changes to its operations, network, volume levels, service offerings, service commitments, or pricing, could have additional negative impacts on our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, a decision by the USPS to terminate early or not renew its contract with FedEx Express for domestic services, which expires in September 2024, would negatively impact our profitability.\n\nWe face intense competition. The transportation and business services markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. Some of our competitors have more financial resources and competitive advantages than we do, appear willing to operate at little or no margin to gain market share, or they are owned, controlled, or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to raise capital more easily. We also compete with regional transportation providers that operate smaller and less capital-intensive transportation networks and startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, which could in turn reduce our revenues and market share. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. See 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report for additional information.",

          "chunk_text": "## Our industry is rapidly evolving. We expect to continue to face significant competition, which could materially adversely affect us.\n\nOur industry is rapidly evolving, including demands for faster deliveries and increased visibility into shipments. We expect to continue to face significant competition on a local, regional, national and international basis. Competitors include the U. S. and other international postal services, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers, large transportation and e-commerce companies that have made and continue to make significant investments in their own logistics capabilities, some of whom are currently our customers. We also face competition from start ups and other smaller companies that combine technologies with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. Competition may also come from other sources in the future as new technologies are developed. Competitors have cost, operational and organizational structures that differ from ours and may offer services or pricing terms that we are not willing or able to offer. Additionally, to sustain the level of service and value that we deliver to our customers, from time to time we may raise prices and our customers may not be willing to accept these higher prices. If we do not timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures, including replacing any lost volume or maintaining our profitability, we could be materially adversely affected.\n\nContinued transportation market growth may further increase competition. As a result, competitors may improve their financial capacity and strengthen their competitive positions. Business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices, which could materially adversely affect us.\n\n## Changes in our relationships with any of our significant customers, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, business from one customer, Amazon.com, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for 11.7% of our consolidated revenues. Some of our other significant customers can account for a relatively significant portion of our revenues in a particular quarter or year. Customer impact on our revenue is based on factors such as: pricing terms; product launches; e-commerce or other industry trends, including those related to the holiday season; business combinations and the overall growth of a customer's underlying business; as well as any disruptions to their businesses. Customers could choose, and have in the past chosen , to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors, demand pricing concessions for our services, require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs, or develop their own logistics capabilities. In addition, certain of our significant customer contracts include termination rights of either party upon the occurrence of certain events or without cause upon advance notice to the other party. If all or a portion of our business relationships with one or more significant customers were to terminate or significantly change, this could materially adversely affect us.\n\n## Failure to attract or retain qualified employees could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe maintain a large workforce. We necessarily depend on the skills and continued service of our employees, including our executive leadership team. We also regularly hire a large number of part-time and seasonal workers. We must attract, engage, develop and retain a large and diverse global workforce, while controlling labor costs and maintaining an environment that supports our core values. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous factors, including turnover, training costs, regulatory changes, market pressures, inflation, unemployment levels and healthcare and other benefit costs. If we are unable to hire, properly train and retain qualified employees, we could experience higher labor costs, reduced revenues, further increased workers' compensation and automobile liability claims, regulatory noncompliance, customer losses and diminution of our brand value or company culture, which could materially adversely affect us.\n\nIn addition, our strategic initiatives, including transformation, have led and are expected to continue to lead to the creation of fewer, but more impactful, jobs as we strive to lower our cost to serve. Our inability to continue to retain experienced and motivated employees may also materially adversely affect us.\n\n## Increased security requirements impose substantial costs on us and we could be the target of an attack or have a security breach, which could materially adversely affect us.\n\nAs a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security, various governments have adopted and may continue to adopt stricter security requirements resulting in increased operating costs in the transportation industry. Regulatory and legislative requirements may change periodically in response to evolving threats. We cannot determine the effect that any new requirements will have on our operations, cost structure or operating results, and new rules or other future security requirements may increase our operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies. Regardless of our compliance with security requirements or the steps we take to secure our facilities or fleet, we could also be the target of an attack or security breaches could occur, which could materially adversely affect us.",

      "question": "What percentage of LMT's total investments measured at NAV in 2024 were allocated to real estate funds, and how does this compare to BA's direct focus on retail properties as part of its real estate investment strategy?",
      "answer": "LMT allocated $3,088 million (or approximately 32.4%) of its total investments measured at NAV ($9,531 million) to real estate funds in 2024. These real estate funds, as defined in the MS_10k_2024 document, include investments in retail properties. In contrast, BA explicitly states a direct investment focus on retail properties as part of its broader real estate portfolio, indicating a strategic emphasis on this asset class. This comparison reveals that while LMT has significant indirect exposure to retail properties through real estate funds, BA takes a more targeted, direct approach to investing in such properties.",

      "question": "How did the 2022 revenue growth patterns of UPS's export business in the Americas compare with AspenTech's revenue trends in the same region, and what does this suggest about their respective market dynamics?",
      "answer": "UPS reported strong export volume growth in the Americas in 2022, contributing to overall export revenue per piece increasing 15.1%. Meanwhile, AspenTech's revenue in the Americas grew from $200 million in 2021 to $362 million in 2022, indicating a significant rise in demand for its software solutions in the region. This contrast suggests that while UPS benefited from increased cross-border logistics activity, AspenTech experienced accelerated adoption of its software offerings in the Americas, reflecting different growth drivers across logistics and industrial software sectors.",

          "chunk_text": "## UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Volume\n\nAverage daily volume increased for both domestic and export products, with growth primarily in the first half of the year. Volume declined in the fourth quarter, largely due to the year-over-year impacts of COVID-19 on consumer behavior. For the year, we experienced growth from both SMBs and large customers, primarily in the retail, manufacturing and technology sectors. Business-to-business volume increased 10.8% as commercial activity largely returned to pre-pandemic levels. Business-toconsumer volume increased 5.1%, with growth primarily in the first quarter when COVID-19 driven volume was not present in the comparative period. We expect overall volume growth to accelerate in 2022.\n\nExport volume increased for the year, led by Europe and the Americas, while Asia volume was largely unchanged. Volume growth was strongest on intra-Europe trade lanes, as well as from Europe and the Americas to the United States. Trade between Europe and the United Kingdom declined throughout the year as a result of Brexit, which became effective on January 1, 2021. Asia export volume grew significantly in the first quarter, but was then impacted in the second quarter by a reduction in shipments of personal protective equipment relative to 2020. Additionally, COVID-19 impacts within the region reduced the number of flights operated in the second half of the year.\n\nPremium products saw volume growth of 14.9%, driven by Worldwide Express and Transborder Express products. Volume for non-premium products increased 6.9%, driven by growth in our Transborder Standard product. Worldwide Standard volume increased primarily as a result of Brexit, with shipments between the United Kingdom and the European Union that are now subject to duties and taxes shifting from Transborder to Worldwide products.\n\nDomestic volume increased for the year in many markets, with the strongest growth in the United Kingdom and Western Europe, largely due to the impact of COVID-19 on business-to-consumer demand. During the fourth quarter, domestic volume declined, driven by a reduction in e-commerce resulting in fewer residential deliveries, that was slightly offset by growth in commercial volume.\n\n## Rates and Product Mix\n\nIn December 2020, we implemented an average 4.9% net increase in base and accessorial rates for international shipments originating in the United States. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market. In response to capacity constraints resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we began to apply demand-related surcharges on certain lanes in the second quarter of 2020. These surcharges are expected to remain elevated in 2022.\n\nTotal revenue per piece increased 14.4%, driven by changes in base pricing, fuel and demand-related surcharges and favorable shifts in customer and product mix. Currency movements contributed to the increase in revenue per piece for the year, but had a negative impact in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue per piece increased 12.0% for the year.\n\nExport revenue per piece increased 15.1% as a result of the factors described above. Excluding the impact of currency movements, export revenue per piece increased 13.2%.\n\nDomestic revenue per piece increased 9.9% due to changes in base pricing, fuel surcharges and customer and product mix. Although currency movements negatively impacted revenue per piece in the fourth quarter, they contributed to the increase in revenue per piece for the year. Excluding the impact of currency movements, revenue per piece increased 5.6%.\n\nWe expect revenue per piece growth to moderate in 2022.\n\n## Fuel Surcharges\n\nThe fuel surcharge for international air services originating inside or outside the U.S. is largely indexed to the DOE's Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. The fuel surcharges for ground services originating outside the U.S. are indexed to fuel prices in the region or country where the shipment originates.\n\nWhile fluctuations can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our market pricing strategy that impact our overall revenue and yield. Additional components include the mix of services sold, the base price and extra service charges and any pricing discounts offered. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $866 million, primarily due to increases in fuel surcharge indices, as well as overall volume growth and changes in customer and product mix.",

Philip Morris International\u2019s RSU awards also include dividend equivalents, despite not carrying voting rights, and these awards generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date.

          "chunk_text": "This estimate accounts for the costs associated with borrowers who we estimate will participate in the settlement program, as well as estimates for the results of litigation with other borrowers, which in either case can exceed the value of the current loan balance, and represents our best estimate of the total losses we expect to incur over time informed by experience since adopting the program. However, there are a number of factors that could affect the estimate in the future, including: future judicial decisions or binding resolutions by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) or the Polish Supreme Court that could increase the cost to banks of loans invalidated by Polish courts and encourage more borrower lawsuits; the impact of any such decisions or resolutions on how Polish courts will interpret and apply the law in particular cases; the receptivity of borrowers over time to Bank BPH's settlement program; the number of active and inactive borrowers who sue Bank BPH; the ability of Bank BPH to recover from borrowers the original principal amount of loans invalidated by Polish courts; and the impact of potential future legislation in Poland to expedite the court process for borrowers or otherwise relating to foreign currency indexed or denominated mortgage loans. While we are unable at this time to develop a meaningful estimate of reasonably possible losses beyond the amount currently recorded, future changes related to any of the foregoing or in Bank BPH's settlement approach, or other adverse developments such as actions by regulators, legislators or other governmental authorities (including consumer protection regulators), could increase our estimate of total losses and potentially require future cash contributions to Bank BPH. See Note 2 for further information.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS . Our operations involve or have involved the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws, including activities for a variety of matters related to GE businesses that have been discontinued or exited. We record reserves for obligations for ongoing and future environmental remediation activities, such as the Housatonic River cleanup, and for additional liabilities we expect to incur in connection with previously remediated sites, such as natural resource damages for the Hudson River where GE completed dredging in 2019. Additionally, like many other industrial companies, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits related to alleged exposure by workers and others to asbestos or other hazardous materials. Liabilities for environmental remediation and worker exposure claims exclude possible insurance recoveries. It is reasonably possible that our exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to indiv idual sites and lawsuits, such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Total reserves related to environmental remediation and worker exposure claims were $2,003 million and $1,819 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nExpenditures for site remediation and worker exposure claims amounted to approximately $175 million, $246 million and $195 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We presently expect that such expenditures will be approximately $225 million and $225 million in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 25. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION &amp; REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION\n\nSEGMENT INFORMATION. On April 2, 2024, and in conjunction with the GE V ernova separation, we implemented an organizational change to align our reportable segments more closely with our business structure. In connection with our segment reporting change, we have recast previously reported amounts across all reportable segments to conform to current segment presentation.\n\nWe have two reportable segments and three operating segments. Operating segments are aggregated into a reportable segment if the operating segments have similar quantitative economic characteristics and if the operating segments are similar in the following qualitative characteristics: (i) nature of products and services; (ii) nature of production processes; (iii) ty pe or class of customer for their products and services; (iv) methods used to distribute the products or provide services; and (v) if applicable, the nature of the regulatory environment. We have aggregated Defense &amp; Systems and Propulsion &amp; A dditive Technology into one reportable segment (Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies) based on similarity in economic characteristics, other qualitative factors and the objectives and principals of A SC 280, Segment Reporting. This is consistent with how our chief operating decision maker (CODM ), who is our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), allocates resources and makes decisions. Segment accounting policies are the same as described and referenced in Note 1. See About GE Aerospace for a description of our reporting segments as of December 31, 2024.\n\nSegment revenue includes sales of equipment and services by our segments. Segment profit is determined based on performance measures used by our CODM. Our CODM uses segment profit or loss to assess performance and allocate resources to each segment, primarily through periodic budgeting and segment performance reviews. In connection with that assessment, our CODM  may exclude matters, such as charges for impairments, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, costs associated with separation activities, manufacturing footprint rationalization and other similar expenses, acquisition costs and other related charges, certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions and certain litigation settlements. Segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations and the portion of earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and as such only includes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to our share of the consolidated earnings or loss of consolidated subsidiaries. Certain corporate costs, including those related to shared services, employee benefits and information technology, are allocated to our segments based on usage or their relative net cost of operations. See the Corporate &amp; Other section within M D&amp;A  for further information about costs excluded from segment profit.\n\nThe Company does not report total assets by segment for internal or external reporting purposes as the Company's CODM  does not assess performance, make strategic decisions, or allocate resources based on assets.\n\n74 2024 FORM  10-K",

      "question": "How might Arkansas's corporate income tax rate reductions announced in 2024 impact Lockheed Martin's financial position, given their significant operations in Camden, Arkansas, and how does this compare to the potential impact of environmental liabilities on GE's financial planning for 2025-2026 remediation expenditures?",
      "answer": "Arkansas's 2024 legislation reducing corporate income tax rates could provide Lockheed Martin with a more favorable tax environment at its significant Camden, Arkansas facility, potentially lowering its effective tax rate and improving after-tax profitability. This aligns with Union Pacific's experience where Arkansas tax changes contributed to a $34 million reduction in deferred tax expense in 2024. In contrast, GE faces environmental liabilities of $2,003 million at year-end 2024, with planned remediation expenditures of $225 million each in 2025 and 2026, which are not tax-advantaged and represent a growing financial burden rather than relief. The Arkansas tax benefits for LMT thus represent a positive financial development, while GE's environmental liabilities require increasing cash outflows that are not similarly offset by tax legislation.",

      "answer": "FedEx's Certificate of Incorporation restricts Class B common stockholders from voting on most matters, except for specific events such as exiting the core payments business, certain mergers, or amendments to the certificate of incorporation, where they may vote as a separate or combined class. This limited governance structure significantly constrains shareholder influence for Class B holders at FedEx. In contrast, UPS's 2023 financial statements report 726 shares of Class B common stock issued in 2023, but the disclosures do not specify any voting rights or governance provisions for these shares. Without explicit disclosure of governance terms by UPS, it is unclear whether UPS Class B stockholders have any influence at all, making a comparative assessment of shareholder governance rights between FedEx and UPS incomplete and uncertain.",

      "answer": "BA utilizes a discounted cash flow approach for certain Level 3 fixed income investments in its pension portfolio, where observable inputs are unavailable, relying on projected annuity payments and applied discount rates. GE similarly employs a discounted cash flow approach for goodwill impairment testing, using cash flow forecasts adjusted for terminal value assumptions and an appropriate discount rate. Both applications depend heavily on unobservable inputs and forward-looking projections, making them sensitive to changes in discount rate assumptions and cash flow estimates. This sensitivity means that small changes in these assumptions could materially affect both pension asset valuations at BA and impairment determinations at GE.",

        "Hop 1: BA \u2192 Fixed Income Investments: BA discloses its use of discounted cash flow methodology for valuing certain Level 3 fixed income investments when observable market data is unavailable, with significant inputs including projected annuity payments and discount rates.",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.

          "chunk_text": "REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG -TERM SERVICES AG REEMENTS. We enter into long-term services agreements with our customers, predominantly within the CES segment, that require us to maintain the customers' assets over the contract terms, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. Contract modifications that extend or revise contracts are not uncommon. We recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. This requires us to make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the current contract term as well as the costs to perform required maintenance services.\n\nOur rights to consideration for these arrangements are generally based on the utilization of the asset (e.g., per hour of usage) and contractual payment terms are based on either periodic billing schedules or upon the occurrence of a maintenance event, such as an overhaul. A s a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenue of a contract is estimating how customers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. The estimate of utilization, which can change over the contract life, impacts both the amount of customer payments we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract costs. Customers' asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhauls and other service events over the life of the contract. We generally use a combination of both historical utilization trends as well as forward-looking information such as market conditions and potential asset retirements in developing our revenue estimates.\n\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul events, including the frequency of maintenance events and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the maintenance. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.\n\nWe routinely review estimates and revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. Changes in estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis with an adjustment to revenue in the current period. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. Contract modifications that change the rights and obligations, as well as the nature, timing and extent of future cash flows, are evaluated for potential price concessions, contract asset impairments and significant financing to determine if adjustments of earnings are required before effectively accounting for a modified contract as a new contract.\n\nWe regularly assess expected billings adjustments and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and fleet management strategies through close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions may affect a long-term services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings.\n\nOn December 31, 2024, our long-term service agreements net liability balance of $6.6 billion represents approximately 4.1% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $162 billion. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 18.4% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. Revisions to our estimates of future billings or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage point would increase or decrease the long-term service agreements balance by $0.4 billion. Billings collected on these contracts were $8.6 billion and $8.1 billion during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Notes 1 and 8 for further information.\n\nNONRECURRING ENGINEERING  COSTS. We incur contract fulfillment costs for engineering and development of products directly related to existing or anticipated contracts with customers, primarily in our Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies segment. Contract fulfillment costs are capitalized to the extent recoverable from the customer contract, and subsequently amortized as the products are delivered to the customer. We periodically assess the recoverability of capitalized contract fulfillment costs, which requires significant judgement. Specifically, we estimate program volumes, contract revenue based on negotiated prices, and product costs based on input costs, inflation and productivity. See Note 8 for further information.\n\nIMPAIRMENT OF G OODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIED INTANG IBLE ASSETS . Goodwill is subject to annual, or more frequent, if necessary, impairment testing. In the impairment test, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions, or a market approach, when available and appropriate, utilizing market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, or both. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, and changes to those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analyses on key estimates and assumptions. Once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired. In the fourth quarter of each y ear, we perform our annual impairment test. See Note 7 for further information.\n\nWe review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. To determine fair value, we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate. See Notes 1 and 7 for further information.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 17",

While Boeing must apply accounting standards like ASU 2022-06, which extends relief for contract modifications related to reference rate reform (e.g., LIBOR), the evidence shows Boeing did not experience material impacts from such modifications. Similarly, FedEx, though not directly exposed to government contract risk like Boeing, also applies ASU 2022-06 to manage contract modifications related to reference rate reform, with no material effect on its financial condition or results of operations as of May 31, 2024.

      "answer": "UPS categorizes its corporate debt instruments under Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy and utilizes matrix pricing when broker quotes are not available, as seen in its 2022 disclosures. Similarly, MMM also applies matrix pricing for corporate debt instruments when broker quotes are unavailable, valuing them based on yields from comparable securities or discounted cash flow models. Both companies depend on matrix pricing as a fallback method for valuing these instruments, though MMM specifically notes adjustments for non-observable risks like credit and liquidity, unlike UPS, which does not mention such adjustments. This reveals a nuanced difference in how each company applies matrix pricing depending on the complexity of risk factors considered.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .\n\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value.\n\n- U.S. and Foreign Government Securities : U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities and municipal securities. Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Corporate Debt Instruments : Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Common Stock : Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date.\n- Collective Investment Funds : Collective investment funds consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index. They are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective collective investment funds. The underlying assets are valued based on the net asset value ('NAV'), which is provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCash Flows: Altria makes contributions to the pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax deductible and pays benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. Currently, Altria anticipates making employer contributions to its pension and postretirement plans of up to approximately $30 million for each in 2022. However, the foregoing estimates of 2022 contributions to the pension and postretirement plans are subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, changes in interest rates, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return for each respective plan.\n\nEstimated future benefit payments at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

Private placements are valued by the custodian using recognized pricing services and sources.\n\nThe private equity portfolio is a diversified mix of derivative instruments, growth equity and partnership interests. Growth equity investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.\n\nAbsolute return consists primarily of partnership interests in hedge funds, hedge fund of funds or other private fund vehicles. Corporate debt instruments are valued at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risk ratings.\n\nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include, interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased and interest payable.\n\nThere were no level 3 assets in the fair values of the U.S. pension and postretirement plans assets for the periods ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## International Pension Plans Assets\n\nOutside the U.S., pension plan assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees. The disclosure below of asset categories is presented in aggregate for over 70 defined benefit plans in 25 countries; however, there is significant variation in asset allocation policy from country to country.

The Company provides standard funding and investment guidance to all international plans with more focused guidance to the larger plans.\n\nEach plan has its own strategic asset allocation.

      "answer": "EMR's 2023 filings disclose that there are 97,567,370 securities remaining available for future issuance under its equity compensation plans, which include warrants. This data is disclosed in T_10k_2023.pdf, where EMR reports its capacity for future equity-based compensation. In contrast, Boeing's 2023 10-K filing (BA_10k_2023.pdf) only states that its equity compensation plans approved by shareholders provide for the issuance of common stock to employees and directors, but does not specify the number of shares available for future issuance. Therefore, while EMR provides a concrete figure for future issuance capacity, Boeing does not disclose a specific number, making a direct quantitative comparison impossible but highlighting differing levels of disclosure and planning transparency.",

      "answer": "ASU 2022-04 significantly enhances the visibility of 3M's supplier finance obligations, which stood at $0.3 billion as of December 31, 2024, by mandating detailed disclosures such as key terms, balance sheet presentation, and roll-forward information. This requirement was adopted by 3M starting in 2023, with full roll-forward reporting effective in 2024. Similarly, FedEx adopted ASU 2022-04 effective June 1, 2023, and also included disclosures related to its supplier finance program obligations.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## NOTE 16. Supplier Finance Program Obligations\n\nUnder supplier finance programs, 3M agrees to pay participating banks the stated amount of confirmed invoices from its designated suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices, generally within 90 days of the invoice date. 3M or the banks may terminate the agreements with advance notice. Separately, the banks may have arrangements with the suppliers that provide them the option to request early payment from the banks for invoices confirmed by 3M. 3M's outstanding balances of confirmed invoices in the programs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. These amounts are included within accounts payable on 3M's consolidated balance sheet. The activity in 2024 included approximately $1.5 billion of invoices confirmed and $1.5 billion of invoices paid and other adjustments.\n\n## NOTE 17. Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3M's financial position and performance.\n\nAdditional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:\n\n- Impact on other comprehensive income of non-derivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 9.\n- Fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 18.\n- Derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company's long-term debt are also described in Note 14.\n\nRefer to the section below titled Location on Statement of Income (Loss) and Impact of Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments for details on the location within the consolidated statements of income (loss) for amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow or fair value hedges (along with similar information relative to the hedged items) and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Additional information relative to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included below as applicable.\n\nCash Flow Hedges: For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts: The Company may enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of ex change rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The Company may de-designate a cash flow hedge if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable, if 3M determines that the hedge is no longer expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction, or in certain other circumstances. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income for de-designated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in the value of derivative instruments after de-designation are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments section below. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Interest Rate Contracts: The Company may use forward starting interest rate contracts and treasury rate lock contracts to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments on forecasted debt issuances.\n\nThe amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the gain/(loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had a balance of $15 million associated with the after-tax net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). This includes a remaining balance of $80 million (after-tax loss) related to forward starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock contracts terminated in 2019 concurrent with associated debt issuances, which is being amortized over the respective lives of the underlying notes. Based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, of the total after-tax net unrealized balance as of December 31, 2024, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $44 million after-tax  net unrealized gain over the nex t 12 months (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).",

This ASU requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability.\n\nFedEx is making progress with Network 2.0, as the company has implemented Network 2.0 optimization in more than 50 locations in the U.S. Contracted service providers will handle the pickup and delivery of packages in some locations while employee couriers will handle others.\n\nWe incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $582 million ($444 million, net of tax , or $1.77 per diluted share) in 2024 and $273 million ($209 million, net of tax , or $0.81 per diluted share) in 2023. The costs incurred in 2024 were primarily related to professional fees and severance, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. The costs incurred in 2023 were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in Russia, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express. We did not incur costs associated with our business optimization activities in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe related to the network integration of TNT Express. The plan affected approximately 5,000 employees in Europe across operational teams and back-office functions and was completed during 2023. We incurred costs of $36 million ($27 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) in 2023 and $278 million ($214 million, net of tax , or $0.80 per diluted share) in 2022 associated with our business realignment activities. These costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements. Payments under this program totaled approximately $118 million in 2023 and approximately $225 million in 2022. The cumulative pre-tax cost of our business realignment activities was approximately $430 million. We did not incur any costs related to business realignment activities in 2024.\n\nIn June 2024, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe as part of its ongoing measures to reduce structural costs. The plan will impact between 1,700 and 2,000 employees in Europe across back-office and commercial functions. The execution of the plan is subject to a consultation process that is expected to occur over an 18-month period in accordance with local country processes and regulations. We expect the pre-tax cost of the severance benefits and legal and professional fees to be provided under and related to the plan to range from $250 million to $375 million in cash ex penditures. These charges are expected to be incurred through fiscal 2026 and will be classified as business optimization ex penses.\n\nUSE OF ESTIMATES . The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include self-insurance accruals, retirement plan obligations, long-term incentive accruals, tax  liabilities, loss contingencies, litigation claims, impairment assessments on long-lived assets (including goodwill) that rely on projections of future cash flows, and purchase price allocations.\n\n## NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\n\nNew accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly affect our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements. We believe the following new accounting guidance is relevant to the readers of our financial statements.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires a buyer in a supplier finance program (e.g., reverse factoring) to disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program's nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. The amendments do not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. We adopted this standard effective June 1, 2023 (fiscal 2024). The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or internal controls. See Note 1 for further discussion about our supplier finance program obligations.",

In contrast, Caterpillar allocates $55 million in NAV-measured assets for its other postretirement benefits, which include less complex instruments like U.S. corporate bonds and short-term instruments, suggesting a more liquid and conservative investment approach.

These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed.

Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

      "answer": "GD values its Level 3 assets, including fixed-rate notes, using valuation models that incorporate observable inputs such as interest rates and quoted prices for similar assets. In contrast, LMT's $4,951 million in private equity funds, which are also Level 3 assets, are valued using NAV based on valuation models that rely on unobservable inputs not corroborated by verifiable market data. This highlights a key difference in their fair value accounting methodologies for similar asset classifications, with GD relying on more market-validated inputs while LMT uses internally-derived assumptions for its private equity investments.",

      "question": "How does Honeywell's use of pricing models for valuing fixed income investments in its pension plans compare to Lockheed Martin's approach, given the specific valuation methods and market risks each company discloses?",
      "answer": "Honeywell utilizes pricing models that incorporate observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, and credit spreads to value its fixed income investments in pension plans, with notional exposure of $4,025 million for U.S. plans and $124 million for non-U.S. plans as of December 31, 2023. Similarly, Lockheed Martin also relies on pricing models for Level 2 fixed income investments, using inputs like interest rates and credit spreads, and categorizes Level 3 investments based on discounted cash flow analyses when observable data is unavailable. Both companies face valuation risks tied to market volatility, but Honeywell's significantly higher notional exposure highlights a greater sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations compared to Lockheed Martin, which emphasizes NAV-based valuations for certain commingled funds with redemption periods typically under 90 days.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: HON \u2192 Pricing Models: Honeywell uses pricing models for fixed income investments, with specific notional exposures of $4,025 million (U.S.) and $124 million (non-U.S.) as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Pricing Models \u2192 Fixed Income Investments: Both companies use pricing models that rely on observable market data such as interest rates and credit spreads; Honeywell also uses discounted cash flows for certain investments.",
        "Hop 3: Fixed Income Investments \u2190 LMT: Lockheed Martin categorizes fixed income investments using Level 2 and Level 3 valuations, with Level 3 relying on discounted cash flows and indicative quotes, and also uses NAV-based valuations for certain commingled funds redeemable within 90 days."

      "question": "What is the significance of Citibank, N.A.'s dual role as administrative agent in Boeing's Five-Year Credit Agreement and as agent in Caterpillar's credit facilities, and how does this shared financial relationship potentially influence their respective borrowing terms and liquidity strategies?",
      "answer": "Citibank, N.A. serves as the administrative agent in Boeing's Five-Year Credit Agreement dated October 30, 2019, and also acts as the agent in Caterpillar's Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreements (both 3-Year and 5-Year Facilities) dated September 1, 2022. This dual role positions Citibank as a central coordinator in both companies' syndicated loan structures, which could influence how each company negotiates terms, manages covenant compliance, and accesses liquidity. Given Citibank's oversight in structuring and administering these credit facilities, its involvement may lead to comparable borrowing mechanisms and risk management practices, despite the companies operating in different sectors\u2014aircraft manufacturing and heavy machinery.",

      "answer": "RTX recognizes revenue in excess of billings on U.S. government fixed-price contracts due to performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments, where the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion. This practice is guided by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which outlines allowable cost structures and payment mechanisms. Similarly, GD operates under the FAR and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which regulate cost allowability and allocation across contracts. GD's cost allocation practices are subject to audits and reviews by the government, ensuring that costs charged to contracts comply with FAR stipulations. Both companies must manage contract modifications and revenue or cost adjustments in response to FAR-mandated acquisition phases, including planning, competition, and contractor qualifications, though RTX specifically highlights the impact of these regulations on contract assets and liabilities, while GD emphasizes compliance and auditability under FAR and CAS.",

The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment.  Such  advances  are  not  considered  a  significant  financing  component  because  they  are  used  to  meet  working  capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress, as sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of performing services under the contract is incurred on an other-than-straight-line basis. For some of our long-term aftermarket contracts, we receive payment prior to delivery of products and services, resulting in a contract liability balance, while for others, we deliver products or services in advance of payment, resulting in a contract asset balance.\n\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services that are not distinct are accounted for as part of the existing contract either on a cumulative catch-up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification.\n\nLoss provisions on contracts are recognized to the extent that estimated contract costs exceed the estimated consideration from the products or services contemplated under the contractual arrangement. For new commitments, we generally record loss provisions at contract signing except for certain contracts under which losses are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates us to perform. For existing commitments, anticipated losses on contractual arrangements are recognized in the period in which losses become evident. In estimating losses, products contemplated under contractual arrangements include firm quantities of product sold under contract and, in the commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, future highly probable sales of replacement parts required by regulation that are expected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment. In our commercial engine  and  wheels  and  brakes  businesses,  when  the  OEM  product  is  sold  for  a  loss,  but  the  combined  OEM  and  aftermarket arrangement for each individual sales campaign is profitable, we record OEM product losses at the time of product delivery.\n\nWe review our Estimate at Completion (EACs) on significant contracts on a periodic basis and for others, no less than annually or when  a  change  in  circumstances  warrant  a  modification  to  a  previous  estimate.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  work  required  to  be performed on many of the Company's performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks  and  opportunities  relate  to  management's  judgment  about  the  ability  and  cost  to  achieve  the  schedule,  consideration  of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or  aircraft  landings,  and  related  variable  consideration.  Management's  judgment  related  to  these  considerations  has  become increasingly more significant given the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity  and  scope  of  the  work  to  be  performed,  the  availability  and  cost  of  materials,  the  length  of  time  to  complete  the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives  of  components,  among  others.  Cost  estimates  may  also  include  the  estimated  cost  of  satisfying  our  industrial  cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts primarily within our RIS and RMD",

We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.\n\n## REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

      "answer": "Caterpillar values its Level 3 non-U.S. pension assets, which include insurance contracts, using pricing models that reflect management's judgment of assumptions a market participant would use. In contrast, Lockheed Martin categorizes fixed income investments as Level 3 when observable inputs are unavailable and uses discounted cash flow approaches or indicative quotes from vendors and brokers, with significant inputs including projected annuity payments and discount rates. Both companies rely on unobservable inputs for Level 3 assets, but Caterpillar focuses on pricing models based on management assumptions, while Lockheed Martin employs a broader set of valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and third-party indicative quotes.",

        "Hop 1: CAT \u2192 Pricing Models: Caterpillar uses pricing models for Level 3 non-U.S. pension assets (e.g., insurance contracts), which are based on management\u2019s judgment of market participant assumptions.",
        "Hop 2: Pricing Models \u2192 Fixed Income Investments: Lockheed Martin uses pricing models for Level 2 fixed income investments, while Level 3 fixed income assets are valued using unobservable inputs such as discounted cash flows, annuity projections, and discount rates.",

The activity in our non-U.S. pension Level 3 assets involved insurance contracts. During 2024, activity was settlements of $59 million and unrealized losses of $15 million. During 2023, activity was purchases of $633 million, settlements of $9 million and unrealized gains of $51 million. We valued these instruments using pricing models that, in management's judgment, reflect the assumptions a market participant would use.\n\n## E. Defined contribution plans\n\nWe have both  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  employee  defined  contribution  plans  to  help  employees  save  for  retirement. Our  primary  U.S.  401(k)  plan  allows  eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the plan. Employees are eligible for matching contributions equal to 100 percent of employee contributions to the plan up to 6 percent of cash compensation and an annual employer contribution that ranges from 3  to 5 percent of cash compensation (depending on years of service and age).\n\nThese 401(k) plans include various investment funds, including a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the ESOP  held 10.4  million  and 11.3  million  shares,  respectively. We  allocate  all  of  the  shares  held  by  the  ESOP  to  participant  accounts. Dividends  paid  to participants are automatically reinvested into company shares unless the participant elects to have all or a portion of the dividend paid to the participant. Various other U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans generally allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the plans, and in most cases, we provide a matching contribution to the funds.",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $990 million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024. There are no expected required contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2025.\n\nThe following table presents estimated future benefit payments as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\n\n",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $990 million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024. There are no expected required contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2025.\n\nThe following table presents estimated future benefit payments as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\n\n",

According to UPS's disclosures, NAV is used as a practical expedient for investments without readily determinable fair values, with inherent limitations in obtaining a precise measurement. These differences suggest HON maintains minimal exposure to private equity funds measured at NAV, whereas GD incorporates NAV-based funds more broadly into its defined benefit plan valuation methodology.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

      "answer": "General Dynamics defers $305 million in other contract costs under FAR regulations that govern cost allowability and allocation to U.S. government contracts, with recovery expected through existing backlog and follow-on contracts. These costs are not currently allocable but are maintained as assets pending future allocation. In contrast, Raytheon Technologies faces financial risk on its fixed-price contracts, particularly firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts, where it bears the full burden of cost overruns without reimbursement. This creates a more direct financial exposure compared to General Dynamics\u2019 deferred cost model. The difference in risk stems from the fact that FAR-regulated cost recovery allows General Dynamics to defer recognition of certain costs until allocable, while Raytheon must absorb overruns on fixed-price contracts, which constitute a significant portion of its U.S. government contract portfolio.",

We  consider  securities  with  a maturity  of  three  months  or  less  to  be  cash  equivalents.  Our  cash  balances  are  invested  primarily  in  time deposits rated A-/A3 or higher. Our investments in other securities are included in other current and noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We report our equity securities at fair value with subsequent changes in  fair  value  recognized  in  net  earnings.  We  report  our  available-for-sale  debt  securities  at  fair  value  with unrealized  gains  and  losses  recognized  as  a  component  of  other  comprehensive  income  in  the  Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. We had no trading or held-to-maturity debt securities on December 31, 2021 or 2020. See Note P for additional information regarding our investments in debt and equity securities.\n\nOther Contract Costs. Other contract costs represent amounts accrued under GAAP that are not currently allocable to U.S. government contracts in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). These costs include workers' compensation, pension and other post-retirement benefits,  and  environmental  obligations.  We  defer  these  costs  in  other  current  assets  on  the  Consolidated Balance  Sheet  until  they  can  be  allocated  to  contracts,  which  is  generally  after  they  are  paid.  We  expect  to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. We regularly  assess  the  probability  of  recovery  of  these  costs.  If  the  backlog  in  the  future  does  not  support  the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Other contract costs on December 31, 2021 and 2020, were $305 and $499, respectively.\n\nAcquisitions  and  Divestitures. In  the  last  three  years,  we  acquired  six  businesses  in  our  Aerospace segment,  two  businesses  in  our  Combat  Systems  segment  and  a  business  in  our  Technologies  segment.  The operating results of these acquisitions have been included with our reported results since the respective closing dates. The purchase prices of the acquisitions have been allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill.\n\nIn  2020,  we  completed  the  sale  of  a  business  in  our  Aerospace  segment  and  two  businesses  in  our Technologies  segment,  one  of  which  was  classified  as  held  for  sale  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  on December  31,  2019.  In  2019,  we  completed  the  sale  of  a  business  in  our  Technologies  segment  that  was classified as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on December 31, 2018.\n\nLong-lived  Assets  and  Goodwill. We  review  long-lived  assets,  including  intangible  assets  subject  to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows. Impairment losses, where identified, are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived assets over the estimated fair value as determined by discounted cash flows.",

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

Significant changes in U.S. government defense spending or changes in U.S. government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\nWe Face Risks Relating to Our U.S. Government Contracts and the Mix of Our U.S. Government Contracts and Programs that Could Negatively Impact our Financial Condition, Results of Operations, Liquidity and Overall Business. The termination of one or more of our contracts, or the occurrence of performance delays, cost overruns, product failures, materials or components shortages,  or  contract  definitization  delays,  could  negatively  impact  our  competitive  position,  results  of  operations,  financial condition and liquidity. U.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without  prior  notice,  at  the  U.S.  government's  convenience  or  for  default  based  on  performance.  If  one  of  our  contracts  is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for work accepted by the U.S. government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. In addition, we are a subcontractor on some contracts and the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, without regard to our performance as a subcontractor. We can give no assurance that we would be awarded new U.S. government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of the termination  of  any  of  our  contracts.  In  addition,  because  the  funding  of  U.S.  government  programs  is  subject  to  congressional appropriations made on a fiscal year basis even for multi-year programs, programs are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future years. Appropriation bills may be delayed, which may result in delays to funding, the collection of receivables and our contract performance due to lack of authorized funds to procure related products and services. Under certain circumstances, we may use our own funds to meet our customer's desired delivery dates or other requirements, but we may not be reimbursed. Further, if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable, reduced or delayed, the U.S. government may terminate for  convenience our contract or subcontract under that program. In addition, our U.S. government contracts typically involve  the  development,  application  and  manufacture  of  advanced  defense  and  technology  systems  and  products  aimed  at achieving  challenging  goals.  New  technologies  may  be  untested  or  unproven  and  in  some  instances,  product  requirements  or specifications may be modified. As a result, we may experience technological and other performance difficulties, which may result in delays, setbacks, cost overruns or product failures, and could divert our attention or resources from other projects. Our failure to execute effectively on our development programs could impact our future sales opportunities. Additionally, in order to win certain U.S. government contracts, we may be required to invest in development prior to award as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions. These additional investments may not be worthwhile if we are not chosen for these awards.\n\nOur U.S. government contracts are typically either fixed-priced contracts or cost reimbursement contracts. Fixed-price contracts are predominantly either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, we generally share with the U.S. government savings for cost underruns less than target costs and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated ceiling price. We carry the entire burden of cost overruns exceeding the ceiling price amount under FPI contracts. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed or performance-based fee, but  we  are  generally  not  reimbursed  for  unauthorized  costs  exceeding  a  cost  ceiling  amount  or  costs  not  allowable  under  the contract or applicable regulations. If we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, our profitability could be negatively affected, particularly under fixed-price development contracts. We may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenues, and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenues. While contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are  typically  cost  reimbursable,  they  can  be  FFP  or  FPI,  which  can  significantly  increase  our  risk  of  a  potential  negative  profit adjustment, as development contracts by nature involve elements that have not been undertaken before and, thus, are highly subject to  future  unexpected cost growth. In addition, other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production, which includes starting and stabilizing a manufacturing and test line while the final design is still being validated. Moreover, over the past several years, the DoD has increased its use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracts, under which it awards certain prototypes, research and production contracts without all of the procurement requirements that typically apply to DoD contracts, including justification of sole source awards. OTAs may use fixed-price contracts during all phases of the contract, or mandated contract  cost  sharing  (e.g.,  one-third  of  program  costs).  They  may  also  require  non-traditional  subcontractor  participation  and impose other requirements that differ from our other DoD contracts. Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to perform on our OTA contracts, including any applicable non-traditional requirements. Moreover, from time to time, we may begin performance under an undefinitized contract action with a not-to-exceed price prior to completing contract negotiations in order to support U.S. government priorities. Uncertainties in final contract price, specifications and terms, or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization, may negatively affect our profitability. In addition, as discussed more fully below, our U.S. government contracts also require us to comply with extensive and evolving procurement rules and regulations and subject us to potential U.S. government audits, investigations, and disputes. We are also involved in programs that are classified by the U.S.",

These funds typically have terms between eight and ten years. GD, on the other hand, reports that its Level 3 assets include direct private equity investments that are measured using inputs unobservable to a marketplace participant. While both companies rely on unobservable inputs for certain assets, LMT's real estate funds are specifically tied to NAV-based models with defined term limits, whereas GD's Level 3 assets focus on private equity with no specific term mentioned. This highlights a nuanced difference in how each company applies valuation models for assets with limited market transparency.",

      "answer": "ASU 2022-06 extended the sunset date for reference rate reform optional expedients and exceptions to December 31, 2024, allowing companies like MMM to continue applying simplified accounting treatments for hedging relationships affected by the phaseout of reference rates such as LIBOR. MMM disclosed in 2023 that it had entered into interest rate contracts as part of its fair value hedging relationships, with a net impact of $15 million recognized in income for derivatives designated as hedging instruments. Meanwhile, CAT is also subject to ASU 2022-06, as noted in its 2023 10-K, which listed the standard under recently adopted accounting updates. This indicates that CAT, like MMM, benefited from the extended relief, allowing both companies to manage the financial and operational complexities of replacing legacy reference rates in hedging and contractual arrangements through 2024.",

      "question": "How do Louisiana's corporate tax rate reductions impact the financial exposure of both Boeing and Union Pacific, given Boeing's dependence on federal appropriations influenced by broader legislative dynamics and Union Pacific's direct operations in the state?",
      "answer": "Louisiana enacted legislation to reduce its corporate income tax rate for future years, resulting in a $34 million reduction of Union Pacific\u2019s deferred tax expense in 2024. Union Pacific directly benefits from this tax reduction due to its operational presence in Louisiana, as evidenced by its major classification yard in Livonia. Boeing, on the other hand, does not directly benefit from Louisiana\u2019s tax changes but faces exposure to broader legislative uncertainty, particularly in terms of federal appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense and other government agencies. A lapse or delay in federal funding could disrupt Boeing\u2019s operations, delay aircraft certifications, or impact future orders. Therefore, while Union Pacific experiences a quantifiable financial benefit ($34 million reduction in deferred tax expense) from Louisiana\u2019s tax legislation, Boeing\u2019s exposure is indirect and tied to the uncertainty of federal budget dynamics influenced by the same legislative environment.",

Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards and/or potentially required sustainability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, is costly and technologically challenging. These  challenges  are  particularly  significant  with  newer  aircraft  programs.  Any  failure  of  any  Boeing  aircraft  to  satisfy  performance  or  reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower rev enues.\n\nChanges  in  levels  of  U.S.  government  defense  spending  or  acquisition  priorities,  as  well  as  significant  delays  in  U.S.  government appropriations, could negatively impact our business, financial position and results of operations.\n\nWe derive a substantial portion of our rev enue from the U.S. gov ernment, primarily from defense related programs with the United States Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) and contracts with other gov ernment agencies, including NASA. Lev els of U.S. defense spending are v ery difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such as the ev olv ing nature of the national security threat env ironment, U.S. national security strategy, U.S. foreign policy,  the  domestic  political  env ironment,  macroeconomic  conditions  and  the  ability  of  the  U.S.  gov ernment  to  enact  relev ant  legislation  such  as authorization and appropriations bills. The gov ernment may also constrain discretionary spending by instituting enforceable spending caps.\n\nThe  timeliness  of  annual  appropriations  for  U.S.  gov ernment  departments  and  agencies  remains  a  recurrent  risk.  Congress  may  fund  gov ernment departments  and  agencies  with  one  or  more  continuing  resolutions,  which  could  delay  new  programs  or  competitions  and/or  negativ ely  impact  the execution of certain program activ ities. A lapse in appropriations for gov ernment departments or agencies would result in a full or partial gov ernment shutdown,  which  could  impact  our  operations.  In  the  ev ent  of  a  prolonged  shutdown,  requirements  to  furlough  employees  in  the  U.S.  DoD,  the Department of Transportation, including the FAA, or other gov ernment agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to deliv er commercial airplanes or perform work on existing contracts, delays in the certification of new aircraft or otherwise impact our operations, negativ ely impact future orders, and/or cause other disruptions or delays. There is uncertainty regarding which gov ernment functions would shut down or continue operations during a lapse in appropriations, and corresponding uncertainty regarding the extent or magnitude of potential impacts to our operations. For additional information  on  U.S.  gov ernment  appropriations  and  budgets,  see  'Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of Operations - Additional Considerations - U.S. Gov ernment Funding' on page 31 of this Form 10-K.\n\nIn  addition, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to future acquisition priorities and program-lev el appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies (including NASA), including changes to national security and defense priorities, and tension between modernization inv estments, sustainment inv estments, and inv estments in new technologies or emergent capabilities. Future inv estment priority changes or budget cuts, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs or future program opportunities. Any of these impacts could hav e a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nAs a result of the significant  ongoing  uncertainty  with  respect  to  both  U.S.  defense  spending  and  the  ev olv ing  nature  of  the  national  security  threat environment, we also expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize affordability, innov ation, cybersecurity and deliv ery of technical data and software in its procurement processes, including the implementation of cybersecurity compliance requirements on the Defense Industrial Base, for which the supply chain may not be fully prepared. If we and our suppliers are unable to adjust to these changing acquisition priorities and policies, our rev enues and market share could be impacted.",

The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income-based and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate the fair value. These inputs include reported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the same or similar securities, issuer credit spreads, benchmark securities, prepayment/default projections based on historical data and other observable inputs.\n\n## Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts\n\nOur foreign currency derivative contracts have maturities of 18 months or less and all are with counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A- or equivalent by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, Inc. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by utilizing an income-based industry standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR') and swap rates. These inputs, where applicable, are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n\n## Level 3 Inputs\n\n## Contingent Consideration Liability\n\nIn connection with our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR G mbH ('MYR'), we are subject to a potential contingent consideration payment of up to \u20ac300 million, subject to customary adjustments, which is revalued each reporting period using probability-weighted scenarios for U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA') approval of Hepcludex until the related contingency is resolved.\n\nThe following table summarizes the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liability:\n\n",

We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with ex posure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in ex change rates, interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non-linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts.\n\nThere are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that foreign currency ex change rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex  market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fix ed and floating interest rate mix  of our interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions. Additionally, changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions.\n\n",

      "answer": "General Dynamics bases its pension discount rates on a current yield curve developed from high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period. Honeywell, on the other hand, uses discounted cash flow models for asset valuation\u2014particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements\u2014incorporating assumptions like expected industry growth rates, sales volumes, and discount rates. The LMT filing clarifies that certain fixed income investments are categorized as Level 3 when valuations using observable inputs are unavailable, and these are valued using a discounted cash flow approach with significant inputs like projected annuity payments and discount rates. This reveals that both companies rely on discounted cash flow techniques involving unobservable inputs (Level 3), albeit in different financial contexts\u2014GD for pension liabilities and HON for asset impairments.",

The U.S. gov ernment can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.\n\nCommercial  Aircraft. In  the  U.S.,  our  commercial  aircraft  products  are  required  to  comply  with  FAA  regulations  gov erning  production  and  quality systems, airworthiness and installation approv als, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. For example, as a result of the Alaska Airlines 737-9 accident in January 2024, the FAA inv estigated the 737 quality control system, including Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (Spirit), and increased its  ov ersight  of  our  production  and  quality  and  safety  management  systems.  In  addition,  the  FAA  communicated  it  will  not  approv e  production  rate increases beyond 38 per month or additional production lines until Boeing has complied with required quality and safety standards. New aircraft models and  new  deriv ativ e  aircraft  are  required  to  obtain  FAA  certification  prior  to  entry  into  serv ice.  Outside  the  U.S.,  similar  requirements  exist  for airworthiness, installation and operational approv als. T hese requirements are generally administered by the national av iation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Union Av iation Safety Agency.\n\nEnvironmental. We  are  subject  to  v arious  federal,  state,  local  and  non-U.S.  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  env ironmental  protection,  including  the utilization,  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal  and  remediation  of  hazardous  substances  and  wastes.  We  could  also  be  affected  by  laws  and regulations relating to climate change, including laws limiting or otherwise related to greenhouse gas emissions. These laws and regulations could lead to increased env ironmental compliance expenditures, increased energy and raw materials costs and new and/or additional inv estment in designs and technologies.  We  continually  assess  our  compliance  status  and  management  of  env ironmental  matters  to  monitor  compliance  with  applicable environmental  laws  and  regulations.  Inv estigation,  remediation  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  associated  with  env ironmental  compliance  and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. gov ernment. It is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued env ironmental compliance could hav e a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are discov ered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of inv estigations. For additional information relating to env ironmental contingencies, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nNon-U.S. Sales. Our non-U.S. sales are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. gov ernmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, tariffs, inv estment, exchange controls, anti-corruption and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S. sales are also subject to v arying currency, political and economic risks.\n\n## Raw Materials, Parts and Subassemblies\n\nWe are highly dependent on the av ailability and quality of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. T he most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions)  and  composites  (including  carbon  and  boron).  Although  alternativ e  sources  generally  exist  for  these  raw  materials,  qualification  of  the sources could take a year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis. We continue to work with a small number of sole-source suppliers to ensure continuity of supply for certain items.\n\n## Suppliers\n\nWe are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and deliv ery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensiv e qualification and performance surv eillance system to control risk",

(Spirit) in an all-stock transaction at an equity v alue of approximately $4,700, or $37.25 per share of Spirit Class A Common Stock. The transaction will include the assumption of Spirit's net debt at closing.\n\nEach share of Spirit common stock will be exchanged for a number of shares of Boeing common stock equal to an exchange ratio between 0.18 and 0.25, calculated as $37.25 div ided by the v olume weighted av erage share price of Boeing shares ov er the 15-trading-day period ending on the second trading day prior to the closing (subject to a floor of $149.00 per share and a ceiling of $206.94 per share). Spirit stockholders will receiv e 0.25 Boeing shares for each of their Spirit shares if the v olume-weighted av erage price is at or below $149.00, and 0.18 Boeing shares for each of their Spirit shares if the v olume-weighted av erage price is at or abov e $206.94 per share.\n\nBoeing's acquisition of Spirit will include substantially all Boeing-related commercial operations, as well as certain other operations.\n\nSpirit has also entered into a binding term sheet with Airbus SE (Airbus) setting forth the terms upon which Airbus will, assuming the parties enter into definitiv e agreements and receiv e all required regulatory approv als, acquire certain commercial work packages that Spirit performs for Airbus concurrently with the closing of the Boeing-Spirit merger. In addition, Spirit is selling certain of its other operations.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close mid-2025 and is subject to the sale of the Spirit operations related to certain Airbus commercial work packages and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approv als. On January 31, 2025, Spirit's stockholders approv ed the Merger Agreement and the related transactions.\n\nThe  Merger Agreement contains certain termination  rights,  including  that  either  Boeing  or  Spirit  may  terminate  the  Merger Agreement  if,  subject  to certain limitations, the transaction has not been consummated by March 31, 2025 (subject to three automatic three-month extensions if on each such date all of the closing conditions except those relating to regulatory approv als hav e been satisfied or waiv ed) (the Outside Date). If either party breaches or fails to perform any of its representations, warranties or cov enants under the Merger Agreement such that the related conditions to the other party's obligation to consummate the Merger would not be satisfied, and such breach or failure is not curable by the Outside Date or, if curable by the Outside Date, has not been cured within 30 days following notice thereof, such other party may terminate the Merger Agreement.\n\nThe Merger Agreement also provides that we will be required to pay Spirit a termination fee of $300 if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Spirit or Boeing under certain specified circumstances as a result of the parties' failure to obtain the required regulatory approv als by the Outside Date or in the event  that  any  law  or  order  related  to  the  required  regulatory  approv als  or  any  applicable  antitrust  law  or  foreign  inv estment  law  prohibits  the consummation of the Merger.\n\nDuring 2023 and 2024, Boeing reached agreements to provide Spirit up to $1,067 to support its liquidity, rate readiness, and 787 tooling and capital expenditures,  of  which  $166  has  yet  to  be  drawn. At  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  Other  current  assets  included  $539  and  $0  and  Other  assets included $299 and $143. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, adv ance payments to Spirit of $165 and $223 were included in Inv entories and are scheduled to be recov ered as the related shipsets are receiv ed by Boeing from Spirit.\n\nOn January 22, 2025, Boeing and Spirit reached an agreement to reschedule repayment dates for $515 to 2026. This includes changing repayment of $425 originally due in 2024 to 2026. In the ev ent that the",

We engage in both direct commercial sales, which generally require U.S. government licenses and approvals, as well as foreign military sales, which are government-to-government transactions initiated by, and carried out at the direction of, the U.S. government. Changes in budgets and spending levels, policies, or priorities, which are subject to geopolitical risks and threats, may impact our defense businesses, including the timing of and delays in U.S. government licenses and approvals for sales, the risk of sanctions or other restrictions, as well as potential human rights issues associated with the use of our defense products. These risks and uncertainties may directly or indirectly impact our commercial businesses as well.\n\nIn February 2023, China announced sanctions against Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense (RMD) (a former RTX Corporation (RTX) business segment, which became part of Raytheon as a result of the July 1, 2023 RTX segment realignment), and previously announced it may take measures against RTX, in connection with certain foreign military sales to Taiwan. The Chinese sanctions against RMD included a fine equal to twice the value of the arms that RMD sold to Taiwan since September 2020. Since that time, China has announced additional sanctions against the Raytheon business and a Collins Aerospace (Collins) joint venture. If China were to impose additional sanctions, enforce announced sanctions, or take other regulatory action against RTX, our suppliers, affiliates, or partners, it could potentially disrupt our business operations. Any impact of these or other potential sanctions, or other actions by  China, is uncertain.  Our businesses have sold, and are expected to sell in the future, additional defense products to Taiwan from time to time in alignment with U.S. government policy, and we are unable to determine the potential impact, if any, of any future sanctions or other actions by China in response to these sales. Moreover, the Chinese government has generally expanded its ability to restrict China-related import, ex port and investment activities, which may have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business or sell our commercial aerospace products in China. In addition, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. government and the governments of various jurisdictions in which we operate have imposed broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in Russia. The Russian government has implemented similar counter-sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in the  U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate,  including  certain  members  of  the  Company's  management  team  and  Board  of  Directors.  These  government  measures,  among  other  limitations,  restrict transactions involving various Russian banks and financial institutions and impose enhanced export controls limiting transfers of various goods, software, and technologies to and from Russia, including broadened export controls specifically targeting the aerospace sector. These measures have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers.\n\nWe continue to closely monitor potential impacts to RTX's business, customers, suppliers, employees, and operations in Israel, the Middle East, and the region at large due to the war in G aza, including a recently-announced ceasefire, the related escalation of conflict and instability in the region, and the regime change in Syria. RTX's commercial manufacturing facilities in Israel remain open and operational and have continued exporting products and importing critical items and raw materials. RTX's defense programs' ability to receive components from Israel has not been impacted in any material respect, although we could experience future delivery delays of certain products if the ceasefire does not hold, or if further escalations arise. The overall impacts to RTX from this situation have been minimal; however, given the volatile nature of the situation, the potential impacts to RTX are subject to change.\n\nOur financial performance is dependent on the condition of the aerospace industry. Our commercial aerospace businesses constitute a substantial portion of our financial results, and the performance of those businesses is directly tied to economic conditions in the commercial aerospace industry, which is cyclical in nature. Capital spending and demand for aircraft engines, aerospace products, and component aftermarket parts and services is limited to commercial airlines, lessors, other aircraft operators, and aircraft manufacturers that are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline consolidation, bankruptcies and restructuring activities, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, corporate profitability and financial health,  cost  reduction  efforts,  tightening  of  credit  in  financial  markets  and  the  availability  of  aircraft  leasing  and  financing  alternatives,  remaining  performance obligations levels, the satisfaction of certification or other regulatory requirements for aircraft in various jurisdictions, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, political stability, and general economic conditions. Any of these factors affecting the industry could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. In addition, because we have significant business with Airbus and Boeing, our aerospace businesses could be adversely affected by challenges faced by these or other individual customers. Other factors, including future terrorist actions, aviation safety concerns, public health issues, or major natural disasters, could also dramatically reduce the demand for commercial air travel, which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. Additionally, because a substantial portion of product deliveries to commercial aerospace customers are scheduled for delivery in the future, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm",

In contrast, 3M's Five-Year Credit Agreement, dated May 11, 2023, was amended twice within the same year\u2014on July 7, 2023, and September 18, 2023\u2014suggesting a more dynamic approach to credit management.

      "answer": "Caterpillar and Honeywell both adopted ASU 2022-04, which mandates enhanced disclosures for supplier finance programs. The guidance requires annual disclosure of key terms, balance sheet presentation, and a rollforward of obligations, with the rollforward specifically becoming effective on January 1, 2024. Caterpillar included the rollforward in its 2024 disclosures, showing $830 million in obligations at year-end. Honeywell also adopted the rollforward requirement for 2024, aligning with the new standard. Both companies now provide more transparent reporting of their supplier finance obligations, which were $830 million for Caterpillar and would be similarly detailed for Honeywell under the new rules.",

The range of payment terms, typically 60-90 days, we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the Programs. The amount of obligations outstanding that are confirmed as valid to the participating financial institutions for suppliers who voluntarily participate in the Programs, included in Accounts payable in Statement 3, were $830 million and $803 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nThe rollforward of our outstanding obligations confirmed as valid under the Programs for the year ended December 31, 2024 was as follows:",

          "chunk_text": "## (Dollars in Millions Except Per S hare Amounts)\n\nIn August 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-05, 'Business Combinations-Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement.' This ASU requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

          "chunk_text": "## HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts)\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (T opic 405): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs. The new standard requires annual disclosure of the key terms of the program, a description of where in the financial statements amounts outstanding under the program are presented, a rollforward of such amounts, and interim disclosure of amounts outstanding as of the end of each period. The guidance does not affect recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of supplier finance programs. The A SU was effective on January 1, 2023, except for the rollforward, which was effective on January 1, 2024. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2023, with the exception of the rollforward adopted on January 1, 2024. The adoption of this standard does not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nResearch and development costs for projects are expensed as incurred, unless these costs relate to contracts with customers where the Company receives reimbursements. Costs related to contracts with customers for customer-sponsored research and development projects are included as a contract cost and included in Cost of products and services sold when revenue from such contracts is recognized, consistent with the Company's sales recognition policies.\n\n## CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less.\n\n## INVENTORIES\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Carrying value adjustments for inventory obsolescence is equal to the difference between the cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Items capable of being sold, including as spare parts, are classified as finished goods.\n\n## PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty ,  plant  and  equipment  are  recorded  at  cost,  including  any   asset  retirement  obligations,  less  accumulated  depreciation.  For  financial  reporting,  the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and three to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability , the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding asset's useful life.\n\n## GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nThe Company recognizes goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances in conjunction with business combinations, with amounts being recorded at their  respective  fair  v alues  upon  the  closing  of  a  transaction.  Subsequent  to  the  closing  of  a  business  combination,  the  Company  evaluates  and  books adjustments, as applicable, to the preliminary amounts recorded over the relevant measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or if a triggering event occurs or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.  This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter and determined there was no impairment as of that date. The Company is not aware of any additional triggering events.\n\n## DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nThe Company recognizes definite-lived intangible asset balances in conjunction with business combinations, with amounts being recorded at their respective fair values upon the closing of a transaction. Subsequent to the closing of a business combination, the Company evaluates and books adjustments, as applicable, to the preliminary amounts recorded over the relevant measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n\nDefinite-liv ed  intangible  assets  consist  of  customer  relationships,  patents  and  technology ,  trademarks,  and  other  intangibles  and  are  amortized  over  their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to 20 years.\n\n58 Honeywell International Inc.",

      "answer": "UPS utilizes valuation models to assess its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk, assuming instantaneous and parallel shifts in rates and prices. These models are essential for evaluating the fair value of financial instruments with market risk. In contrast, LMT relies on valuation models for its private equity fund investments, which are valued using unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by verifiable market data. LMT's private equity funds totaled $4,951 million in 2023, indicating a significant reliance on these models for long-term, illiquid investments. While both companies use valuation models, UPS's application is focused on short-term market risk sensitivity, whereas LMT's is tied to long-duration private equity assets with less transparent valuations.",

      "question": "How does General Dynamics' treatment of state and local income taxes on U.S. government contracts influence its pricing methodology compared to Lockheed Martin\u2019s FAR-compliant cost-plus approach?",
      "answer": "General Dynamics explicitly includes state and local income taxes allocable to U.S. government contracts in its operating costs and expenses, rather than in the tax provision. This treatment affects how those taxes are accounted for in contract pricing. Since U.S. government contracts are governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which dictates cost allowability and pricing principles, this inclusion of taxes in operating costs may directly impact General Dynamics\u2019 pricing proposals to ensure compliance with FAR\u2019s cost-based pricing framework. Lockheed Martin, under the same FAR-compliant cost-plus-fixed-fee model, negotiates a fixed fee at contract inception that does not vary with actual costs, meaning any embedded tax costs would not alter the fee. Therefore, while both companies operate under the FAR\u2019s regulatory framework, General Dynamics\u2019 explicit treatment of state and local taxes in contract-related operating costs could result in higher cost bases for pricing compared to Lockheed Martin, whose fee structure remains fixed regardless of cost fluctuations.",

We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.\n\n## REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts provide a fixed fee that is negotiated at the inception of the contract and does not vary with actual costs.\n\nWe assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If  combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.\n\nWe evaluate  the  products  or  services  promised  in  each  contract  at  inception  to  determine  whether  the  contract  should  be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have  more  than  one  distinct  performance  obligation,  which  occurs  when  we  perform  activities  that  are  not  highly  complex  or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.\n\nWe determine the transaction  price  for  each  contract  based  on  the  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  for  the  products  or services being provided under the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary, we estimate variable consideration at  the  most  likely  amount,  which  is  included  in  the  transaction  price  to  the  extent  it  is  probable  that  a  significant  reversal  of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.\n\nAt the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently  modified  to  include  changes  in  specifications,  requirements  or  price,  which  may  create  new  or  change  existing enforceable  rights  and  obligations.  Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  modification,  we  consider  whether  to  account  for  the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. Therefore,  such  modifications  are  accounted  for  as  if  they  were  part  of  the  existing  contract  and  recognized  as  a  cumulative adjustment to revenue.\n\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other  products  or  services).  Our  contracts  with  the  U.S.  Government,  including  FMS  contracts,  are  subject  to  the  Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.\n\nFor non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer's specifications.  When  it  is  necessary  to  allocate  the  transaction  price  to  multiple  performance  obligations,  we  typically  use  the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.\n\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For most contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience  and  pay  us  for  costs  incurred  plus  a  reasonable  profit.  For  most  non-U.S.  Government  contracts,  primarily international direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that  do  not  have  an  alternative  use  to  us  and  if  our  customer  were  to  terminate  the  contract  for  reasons  other  than  our  nonperformance  we  would  have  the  right  to  recover  damages  which  would  include,  among  other  potential  damages,  the  right  to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.",

      "question": "How does Union Pacific's tax reduction in Arkansas compare to GE's environmental remediation spending in the same period, and what does this suggest about their respective financial exposure to state-level policy changes?",
      "answer": "Union Pacific reported a $34 million reduction in deferred tax expense due to Arkansas enacting legislation to reduce corporate income tax rates in 2024. Meanwhile, GE reported $2,003 million in total reserves for environmental remediation and worker exposure claims as of December 31, 2024, with $175 million in expenditures for remediation in that year. This suggests that while both companies are exposed to state-level policy changes, GE's financial exposure through environmental liabilities is significantly higher than Union Pacific's exposure through corporate income tax policy in Arkansas.",

          "chunk_text": "This estimate accounts for the costs associated with borrowers who we estimate will participate in the settlement program, as well as estimates for the results of litigation with other borrowers, which in either case can exceed the value of the current loan balance, and represents our best estimate of the total losses we expect to incur over time informed by experience since adopting the program. However, there are a number of factors that could affect the estimate in the future, including: future judicial decisions or binding resolutions by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) or the Polish Supreme Court that could increase the cost to banks of loans invalidated by Polish courts and encourage more borrower lawsuits; the impact of any such decisions or resolutions on how Polish courts will interpret and apply the law in particular cases; the receptivity of borrowers over time to Bank BPH's settlement program; the number of active and inactive borrowers who sue Bank BPH; the ability of Bank BPH to recover from borrowers the original principal amount of loans invalidated by Polish courts; and the impact of potential future legislation in Poland to expedite the court process for borrowers or otherwise relating to foreign currency indexed or denominated mortgage loans. While we are unable at this time to develop a meaningful estimate of reasonably possible losses beyond the amount currently recorded, future changes related to any of the foregoing or in Bank BPH's settlement approach, or other adverse developments such as actions by regulators, legislators or other governmental authorities (including consumer protection regulators), could increase our estimate of total losses and potentially require future cash contributions to Bank BPH. See Note 2 for further information.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS . Our operations involve or have involved the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws, including activities for a variety of matters related to GE businesses that have been discontinued or exited. We record reserves for obligations for ongoing and future environmental remediation activities, such as the Housatonic River cleanup, and for additional liabilities we expect to incur in connection with previously remediated sites, such as natural resource damages for the Hudson River where GE completed dredging in 2019. Additionally, like many other industrial companies, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits related to alleged exposure by workers and others to asbestos or other hazardous materials. Liabilities for environmental remediation and worker exposure claims exclude possible insurance recoveries. It is reasonably possible that our exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to indiv idual sites and lawsuits, such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Total reserves related to environmental remediation and worker exposure claims were $2,003 million and $1,819 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nExpenditures for site remediation and worker exposure claims amounted to approximately $175 million, $246 million and $195 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We presently expect that such expenditures will be approximately $225 million and $225 million in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 25. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION &amp; REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION\n\nSEGMENT INFORMATION. On April 2, 2024, and in conjunction with the GE V ernova separation, we implemented an organizational change to align our reportable segments more closely with our business structure. In connection with our segment reporting change, we have recast previously reported amounts across all reportable segments to conform to current segment presentation.\n\nWe have two reportable segments and three operating segments. Operating segments are aggregated into a reportable segment if the operating segments have similar quantitative economic characteristics and if the operating segments are similar in the following qualitative characteristics: (i) nature of products and services; (ii) nature of production processes; (iii) ty pe or class of customer for their products and services; (iv) methods used to distribute the products or provide services; and (v) if applicable, the nature of the regulatory environment. We have aggregated Defense &amp; Systems and Propulsion &amp; A dditive Technology into one reportable segment (Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies) based on similarity in economic characteristics, other qualitative factors and the objectives and principals of A SC 280, Segment Reporting. This is consistent with how our chief operating decision maker (CODM ), who is our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), allocates resources and makes decisions. Segment accounting policies are the same as described and referenced in Note 1. See About GE Aerospace for a description of our reporting segments as of December 31, 2024.\n\nSegment revenue includes sales of equipment and services by our segments. Segment profit is determined based on performance measures used by our CODM. Our CODM uses segment profit or loss to assess performance and allocate resources to each segment, primarily through periodic budgeting and segment performance reviews. In connection with that assessment, our CODM  may exclude matters, such as charges for impairments, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, costs associated with separation activities, manufacturing footprint rationalization and other similar expenses, acquisition costs and other related charges, certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions and certain litigation settlements. Segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations and the portion of earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and as such only includes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to our share of the consolidated earnings or loss of consolidated subsidiaries. Certain corporate costs, including those related to shared services, employee benefits and information technology, are allocated to our segments based on usage or their relative net cost of operations. See the Corporate &amp; Other section within M D&amp;A  for further information about costs excluded from segment profit.\n\nThe Company does not report total assets by segment for internal or external reporting purposes as the Company's CODM  does not assess performance, make strategic decisions, or allocate resources based on assets.\n\n74 2024 FORM  10-K",

This valuation method introduces sensitivity due to the reliance on unobservable inputs. Similarly, HON uses a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during impairment testing, incorporating strategic and annual operating plans with terminal value assumptions. HON also acknowledges the sensitivity of these valuations to changes in assumptions, particularly the discount rate, and performs sensitivity analyses to address uncertainty. Both companies rely on the discounted cash flow method with key assumptions around discount rates, making the valuation outcomes at both firms sensitive to changes in these inputs, though applied in different asset contexts\u2014fixed income investments at LMT and intangible assets at HON.",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules.

These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $990 million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024. There are no expected required contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2025.\n\nThe following table presents estimated future benefit payments as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets -The Company's business combinations typically result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets. The Company generally engages an independent third-party valuation specialist for assistance in the allocation of the purchase price and determination of the fair value  of  goodwill  and  intangible  assets,  which  involves  the  use  of  accounting  estimates  and  assumptions  based  on  information  available  at  or  near  the acquisition date. The Company believes the accounting estimates and assumptions are reasonable based on information available at the date of acquisition through  historical  experience  and  information  obtained  from  management  of  the  acquired  entity;  however,  there  is  inherent  uncertainty  in  the  accounting estimates as assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent, if necessary , impairment testing. In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, and changes to those  assumptions  could  materially  impact  our  financial  condition  or  operating  performance  if  actual  results  differ  from  such  accounting  estimates  and assumptions. T o address this uncertainty , we perform sensitivity analyses on key accounting estimates and assumptions. Once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired. A ny impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value.\n\nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets -The Company's business combinations typically result in the recognition of customer relationships, patents, and trademarks, in addition to other definite-liv ed intangible assets. The determination of fair value for definite-lived intangible assets, useful lives for amortization purposes and whether or not intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. The assumptions used in developing the accounting estimates  may  include  business  growth  rates,  sales  volume,  selling  prices  and  costs,  cash  flows,  and  the  discount  rate  selected.  Changes  to  those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a definite-lived intangible asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows:\n\n- Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings, or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;\n- Annual operating plans or strategic plan outlook that indicates an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;\n- Significant negative industry or economic trends; or\n- Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets.\n\nOnce it is determined that an impairment review is necessary , recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is then measured as the excess, if any, of the carry ing amount of the asset group over its fair value.\n\nThe fair value estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility . M anagement believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variances from assumptions could materially affect the valuations.\n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans -We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. A nnual pension (income) expense is comprised of service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets, prior service amortization (Pension ongoing (income) expense), and a potential mark-to-market adjustment (M TM  A djustment).\n\nThe key assumptions used in developing our net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## NOTE 16. Supplier Finance Program Obligations\n\nUnder supplier finance programs, 3M agrees to pay participating banks the stated amount of confirmed invoices from its designated suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices, generally within 90 days of the invoice date. 3M or the banks may terminate the agreements with advance notice. Separately, the banks may have arrangements with the suppliers that provide them the option to request early payment from the banks for invoices confirmed by 3M. 3M's outstanding balances of confirmed invoices in the programs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. These amounts are included within accounts payable on 3M's consolidated balance sheet. The activity in 2024 included approximately $1.5 billion of invoices confirmed and $1.5 billion of invoices paid and other adjustments.\n\n## NOTE 17. Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3M's financial position and performance.\n\nAdditional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:\n\n- Impact on other comprehensive income of non-derivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 9.\n- Fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 18.\n- Derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company's long-term debt are also described in Note 14.\n\nRefer to the section below titled Location on Statement of Income (Loss) and Impact of Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments for details on the location within the consolidated statements of income (loss) for amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow or fair value hedges (along with similar information relative to the hedged items) and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Additional information relative to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included below as applicable.\n\nCash Flow Hedges: For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts: The Company may enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of ex change rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The Company may de-designate a cash flow hedge if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable, if 3M determines that the hedge is no longer expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction, or in certain other circumstances. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income for de-designated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in the value of derivative instruments after de-designation are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments section below. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Interest Rate Contracts: The Company may use forward starting interest rate contracts and treasury rate lock contracts to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments on forecasted debt issuances.\n\nThe amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the gain/(loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had a balance of $15 million associated with the after-tax net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). This includes a remaining balance of $80 million (after-tax loss) related to forward starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock contracts terminated in 2019 concurrent with associated debt issuances, which is being amortized over the respective lives of the underlying notes. Based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, of the total after-tax net unrealized balance as of December 31, 2024, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $44 million after-tax  net unrealized gain over the nex t 12 months (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).",

This ASU requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts)\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (T opic 405): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs. The new standard requires annual disclosure of the key terms of the program, a description of where in the financial statements amounts outstanding under the program are presented, a rollforward of such amounts, and interim disclosure of amounts outstanding as of the end of each period. The guidance does not affect recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of supplier finance programs. The A SU was effective on January 1, 2023, except for the rollforward, which was effective on January 1, 2024. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2023, with the exception of the rollforward adopted on January 1, 2024. The adoption of this standard does not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nResearch and development costs for projects are expensed as incurred, unless these costs relate to contracts with customers where the Company receives reimbursements. Costs related to contracts with customers for customer-sponsored research and development projects are included as a contract cost and included in Cost of products and services sold when revenue from such contracts is recognized, consistent with the Company's sales recognition policies.\n\n## CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less.\n\n## INVENTORIES\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Carrying value adjustments for inventory obsolescence is equal to the difference between the cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Items capable of being sold, including as spare parts, are classified as finished goods.\n\n## PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty ,  plant  and  equipment  are  recorded  at  cost,  including  any   asset  retirement  obligations,  less  accumulated  depreciation.  For  financial  reporting,  the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and three to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability , the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding asset's useful life.\n\n## GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nThe Company recognizes goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances in conjunction with business combinations, with amounts being recorded at their  respective  fair  v alues  upon  the  closing  of  a  transaction.  Subsequent  to  the  closing  of  a  business  combination,  the  Company  evaluates  and  books adjustments, as applicable, to the preliminary amounts recorded over the relevant measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or if a triggering event occurs or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.  This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter and determined there was no impairment as of that date. The Company is not aware of any additional triggering events.\n\n## DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nThe Company recognizes definite-lived intangible asset balances in conjunction with business combinations, with amounts being recorded at their respective fair values upon the closing of a transaction. Subsequent to the closing of a business combination, the Company evaluates and books adjustments, as applicable, to the preliminary amounts recorded over the relevant measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n\nDefinite-liv ed  intangible  assets  consist  of  customer  relationships,  patents  and  technology ,  trademarks,  and  other  intangibles  and  are  amortized  over  their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to 20 years.\n\n58 Honeywell International Inc.",

The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, with certain exceptions. ASU 2021-01 amends the scope of the recent reference rate reform guidance.

      "answer": "The extension of ASU 2020-04's sunset date via ASU 2022-06 gives both GE and FDX additional time to manage contracts and hedging relationships affected by the discontinuation of LIBOR, which ceased publication of most USD LIBOR rates on June 30, 2023. GE evaluated the financial impact of LIBOR reform under ASU 2020-04 and found it immaterial, while FDX has not yet experienced any material effect from the reform as of May 31, 2024. The deferral until December 31, 2024 allows both companies to continue applying optional expedients for contract modifications and hedge accounting, easing the transition away from LIBOR references in their financial reporting.",

      "answer": "Emerson discloses that dividend equivalents are only paid on earned performance share awards after the three-year performance period concludes, and it had $58 million in integration-related stock compensation expense tied to RSUs in 2024. In contrast, Caterpillar credits RSU and PRSU awards with dividend equivalent units on each dividend payment date and values RSU awards based on the closing stock price at grant date, with vesting typically occurring after three years. This indicates that Caterpillar provides dividend equivalents throughout the vesting period, whereas Emerson defers them until after performance conditions are met.",

        "Hop 2: Dividend Equivalents \u2192 RSU Awards: RSU awards generally vest after three years and qualify for dividend equivalents, which are units credited to the award in lieu of actual dividend payments.",

      "answer": "The G500, developed by General Dynamics, is positioned as a next-generation replacement for the G450 and G550 models with a clean-sheet design that includes a new wing and advanced avionics. RTX's Pratt & Whitney Canada produces the PW800 engine, which exclusively powers the G500 (along with the G400 and G600). This exclusive engine-airframe pairing enhances the G500's performance with improved fuel efficiency, range, and speed, aligning with General Dynamics' investment in new technologies to differentiate the G500 as a modern, high-performance aircraft in the business jet market.",

      "answer": "GE evaluated the financial impact of LIBOR reform in accordance with ASU 2020-04 and concluded that the overall impact on its financial statements was immaterial. In contrast, CAT actively applied ASU 2020-04 to manage interest rate risk through hedging relationships, including fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges and forward rate agreements as cash flow hedges. CAT's use of these hedging strategies under the guidance of ASU 2020-04 reflects a more operational application of the standard to mitigate interest rate exposure on debt, while GE's approach focused on assessing the reform\u2019s impact rather than implementing new risk mitigation strategies.",

      "question": "How did Emerson's acquisition of AspenTech influence the composition and valuation of Emerson's stock-based compensation plans in fiscal 2023, particularly regarding the treatment of performance shares under ASC 718?",
      "answer": "Emerson's acquisition of AspenTech introduced AspenTech's stock-based compensation plans\u2014including performance shares, restricted stock units, and stock options\u2014into Emerson's existing framework, where outstanding AspenTech awards were converted into Emerson time-based restricted stock units while retaining their original vesting and payment schedules. This integration directly affected the composition of Emerson\u2019s compensation plans by incorporating AspenTech\u2019s previously distinct structures, including performance shares now subject to Emerson\u2019s ASC 718-compliant accounting methodology, which recognizes fixed expense over the performance period. The acquisition also had valuation implications, as the conversion of AspenTech\u2019s equity instruments into Emerson\u2019s treasury stock-based awards altered the number and type of shares issued under these plans, impacting both the 'Performance Shares' line item and overall equity compensation disclosures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MMM \u2192 Performance Shares: MMM disclosed performance shares as part of its equity compensation plans, with 360 thousand shares outstanding, indicating that performance shares are a material component of executive compensation structures in large-cap industrial firms.",
        "Hop 2: Performance Shares \u2192 AspenTech: AspenTech had stock-based compensation plans that included performance shares, and under ASC 718, Emerson now accounts for these on a fixed-expense basis over the performance period following the acquisition.",
        "Hop 3: AspenTech \u2190 EMR: Emerson disclosed the inclusion of AspenTech in its business segments, confirming that AspenTech\u2019s compensation plans were integrated into Emerson\u2019s structure, with NI (and by extension AspenTech) awards converted into Emerson RSUs."

      "answer": "Union Pacific discloses that its pension plan classifies municipal bonds as Level 2 investments, which are valued using a bid evaluation process with bid data from independent pricing sources. Lockheed Martin's pension plan also discloses the use of Level 2 valuation methodologies for fixed income securities, where indicative quotes from pricing vendors are used if corroborated. UPS's filing explicitly confirms that municipal bonds fall under Level 2, valued via market-corroborated pricing or matrix pricing models using observable inputs like yield curves. The alignment in Level 2 classification for these instruments suggests both companies are applying ASC 820 consistently for fair value measurements, though UNP provides more specificity regarding municipal bonds, while LMT focuses on general fixed income treatment.",

      "question": "How do GE's operational challenges related to cost overruns on large-scale projects compare with RTX's exposure to losses under fixed-price contracts, given the impact of macroeconomic inflationary pressures on both companies?",
      "answer": "GE faces operational risks that lead to cost overruns on large-scale, complex projects, particularly in its Power and Renewable Energy divisions, where delays, execution issues, and joint liabilities can result in unanticipated expenses and contractual penalties. RTX, on the other hand, is exposed to losses on fixed-price contracts due to rising material, component, and labor costs driven by inflation, which it cannot always pass on to customers. Both companies are negatively impacted by cost overruns, but GE's exposure is rooted in project execution complexity, while RTX's is tied to pricing inflexibility in fixed-price contracts amid inflationary pressures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GE \u2192 Cost Overruns: GE's large-scale projects, especially in Power and Renewable Energy, are prone to cost overruns due to execution complexity, delays, and joint liabilities with consortium partners.",
        "Hop 2: Cost Overruns \u2192 Fixed-Price Contracts: Inflationary pressures increase material and labor costs, which can lead to cost overruns that particularly impact companies with fixed-price contracts.",
        "Hop 3: Fixed-Price Contracts \u2190 RTX: RTX operates under fixed-price contracts in aerospace and defense, where it cannot always offset rising costs, making it vulnerable to losses when cost overruns occur due to inflation."

      "answer": "General Dynamics deferred $305 million in other contract costs in 2021, which are regulated under the FAR and cannot be allocated to U.S. government contracts until paid, with recovery expected through existing backlog and follow-on contracts. The FAR governs cost allowability and allocation for such contracts, directly influencing how companies like GD and Boeing manage deferred costs and contract profitability. Boeing, also subject to U.S. government contracts, faces risks where termination for convenience or default could limit recovery to only work completed or expose them to re-procurement costs and damages. Therefore, both companies are exposed to regulatory and contractual risks under the FAR, but GD\u2019s risk is tied to deferred cost recovery through future contracts, while Boeing\u2019s risk is more tied to contract termination and re-procurement liabilities.",

          "chunk_text": "\nSee Note K for information regarding our debt obligations, including interest rates.\n\nCash and Equivalents and Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We  consider  securities  with  a maturity  of  three  months  or  less  to  be  cash  equivalents.  Our  cash  balances  are  invested  primarily  in  time deposits rated A-/A3 or higher. Our investments in other securities are included in other current and noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We report our equity securities at fair value with subsequent changes in  fair  value  recognized  in  net  earnings.  We  report  our  available-for-sale  debt  securities  at  fair  value  with unrealized  gains  and  losses  recognized  as  a  component  of  other  comprehensive  income  in  the  Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. We had no trading or held-to-maturity debt securities on December 31, 2021 or 2020. See Note P for additional information regarding our investments in debt and equity securities.\n\nOther Contract Costs. Other contract costs represent amounts accrued under GAAP that are not currently allocable to U.S. government contracts in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). These costs include workers' compensation, pension and other post-retirement benefits,  and  environmental  obligations.  We  defer  these  costs  in  other  current  assets  on  the  Consolidated Balance  Sheet  until  they  can  be  allocated  to  contracts,  which  is  generally  after  they  are  paid.  We  expect  to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. We regularly  assess  the  probability  of  recovery  of  these  costs.  If  the  backlog  in  the  future  does  not  support  the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Other contract costs on December 31, 2021 and 2020, were $305 and $499, respectively.\n\nAcquisitions  and  Divestitures. In  the  last  three  years,  we  acquired  six  businesses  in  our  Aerospace segment,  two  businesses  in  our  Combat  Systems  segment  and  a  business  in  our  Technologies  segment.  The operating results of these acquisitions have been included with our reported results since the respective closing dates. The purchase prices of the acquisitions have been allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill.\n\nIn  2020,  we  completed  the  sale  of  a  business  in  our  Aerospace  segment  and  two  businesses  in  our Technologies  segment,  one  of  which  was  classified  as  held  for  sale  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  on December  31,  2019.  In  2019,  we  completed  the  sale  of  a  business  in  our  Technologies  segment  that  was classified as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on December 31, 2018.\n\nLong-lived  Assets  and  Goodwill. We  review  long-lived  assets,  including  intangible  assets  subject  to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows. Impairment losses, where identified, are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived assets over the estimated fair value as determined by discounted cash flows.",

We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.\n\n## REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

We address employee concerns and take appropriate actions that uphold our Boeing values.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe  commercial  jet  aircraft  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  We  face  aggressive international  competitors  who  are  intent  on  increasing  their  market  share,  such  as  Airbus  and  other  entrants  from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with higher quality products.\n\nBDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Technologies Corporation, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their  North American  operations  and  partnering  with  U.S.  defense  companies.  In  addition,  certain  competitors  have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2022.\n\nThe commercial and defense services markets are extremely challenging and are made up of many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering products and services which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial airplane programs: training, fleet services and logistics, maintenance and engineering, modifications and upgrades, as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. BGS expects the market to remain highly competitive in 2022, and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\nOur businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We work with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to, all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.\n\nGovernment Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our  U.S.  government  contracts  were  to  be  terminated  for  convenience,  we  generally  would  be  entitled  to  receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.\n\nCommercial  Aircraft. In  the  U.S.,  our  commercial  aircraft  products  are  required  to  comply  with  FAA  regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. New aircraft models and new derivative aircraft are required to obtain FAA certification prior to entry into  service.  Outside  the  U.S.,  similar  requirements  exist  for  airworthiness,  installation  and  operational  approvals. These requirements are generally",

      "question": "How might FedEx's operational reliance on leased retail locations at hotels, such as the 200 stores located at hotels and convention centers, compare with UPS's financial exposure to real estate funds\u2014like the $10.1 billion in pension assets invested in real estate, private debt, and hedge funds\u2014in terms of strategic risk during periods of real estate market volatility?",
      "answer": "FedEx maintains a direct operational exposure to hotels through its 200 leased retail locations at hotels and convention centers, positioning it in high-traffic hospitality venues but exposing it to lease renegotiations or relocations if hotel operators change tenants. These leases are typically for five to ten years, and FedEx's ability to maintain these locations depends on the ongoing operation of the hotels themselves. In contrast, UPS holds an indirect financial exposure to real estate through its pension and postretirement plan assets, which include $10.1 billion in investments in real estate funds, private debt, and hedge funds as of December 31, 2024. These funds may include investments in hotels and other commercial properties, meaning UPS\u2019s exposure is tied to the performance of these funds rather than direct occupancy or lease agreements. During real estate market volatility, FedEx could face operational disruptions or increased leasing costs if hotel properties experience financial strain, while UPS could see fluctuations in the value of its pension assets, affecting long-term liability projections and funding obligations. Thus, while both companies are exposed to the real estate sector, the nature of their risk\u2014operational for FedEx and financial for UPS\u2014differs significantly in both timing and impact.",

Changes in the fix ed income, foreign currency ex change and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. Further information on our accounting policies relating to fair value measurements can be found in note 1 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the majority of our financial instruments were categorized as either Level 1 or Level 2. Refer to notes 3, 9 and 17 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for further information on these instruments. A quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates is presented in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk section of this report.\n\nOur pension and postretirement plan assets include investments in hedge funds, as well as private debt, private equity and real estate funds, which are primarily measured using net asset value (\"NAV\") as a practical expedient for fair value, as appropriate. These investments were valued at $10.1 billion as of December 31, 2024. In order to estimate NAV, we evaluate audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers and make adjustments for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. These investments are not actively traded, and their values can only be estimated using these assumptions. If our estimates of activity changed, this could have a material impact on the reported value of these investments and on the return on assets that we report. Refer to note 5 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for further information on our pension and postretirement plan assets.\n\nCertain non-financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. These assets are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of an impairment or when an asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale.\n\nIn accounting for business acquisitions, we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment, especially with respect to identified intangible assets as there may be limited or no observable transactions within the market, requiring us to develop internal models to estimate fair value. For ex ample, estimating the fair value of identified intangible assets may require us to develop valuation assumptions, including but not limited to, future expected cash flows from these assets, synergies and the cost of capital. Certain inputs require us to determine assumptions that are reflective of a market participant view of fair value. Changes in any of these assumptions may materially impact the amount we recognize for identifiable assets and liabilities, in addition to the residual amount allocated to goodwill.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense within our financial statements. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction, tax  credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of deferred tax  assets and liabilities arising from timing differences in the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as tax, interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax ex pense in a subsequent period.\n\nWe assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we increase our provision for tax es by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax  assets recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely.\n\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex  tax  regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. Once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from positions filed or to be filed with the tax authorities is recorded as a liability for uncertain tax  benefits. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate uncertain tax positions quarterly based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity.

      "answer": "UPS applied ASU 2020-04 to its designated hedging relationships, including cash flow, fair value, and net investment hedges, using the optional expedients to manage exposure to reference rate reform without material impact on financial statements. In contrast, GE specifically evaluated the cessation of USD LIBOR rates (which ended on June 30, 2023) under ASU 2020-04 and also reported an immaterial financial impact. The key distinction lies in UPS\u2019s broader hedging framework versus GE\u2019s focused response to the actual LIBOR cessation event.",

      "answer": "RTX values its private equity limited partnerships on a quarterly basis using discounted cash flows, earnings multiples, and market multiples, with valuation adjustments reflecting changes in operating results, financial condition, or prospects of the applicable portfolio company.

Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts provide a fixed fee that is negotiated at the inception of the contract and does not vary with actual costs.\n\nWe assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If  combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.\n\nWe evaluate  the  products  or  services  promised  in  each  contract  at  inception  to  determine  whether  the  contract  should  be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have  more  than  one  distinct  performance  obligation,  which  occurs  when  we  perform  activities  that  are  not  highly  complex  or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.\n\nWe determine the transaction  price  for  each  contract  based  on  the  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  for  the  products  or services being provided under the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary, we estimate variable consideration at  the  most  likely  amount,  which  is  included  in  the  transaction  price  to  the  extent  it  is  probable  that  a  significant  reversal  of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.\n\nAt the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently  modified  to  include  changes  in  specifications,  requirements  or  price,  which  may  create  new  or  change  existing enforceable  rights  and  obligations.  Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  modification,  we  consider  whether  to  account  for  the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. Therefore,  such  modifications  are  accounted  for  as  if  they  were  part  of  the  existing  contract  and  recognized  as  a  cumulative adjustment to revenue.\n\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other  products  or  services).  Our  contracts  with  the  U.S.  Government,  including  FMS  contracts,  are  subject  to  the  Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.\n\nFor non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer's specifications.  When  it  is  necessary  to  allocate  the  transaction  price  to  multiple  performance  obligations,  we  typically  use  the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.\n\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For most contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience  and  pay  us  for  costs  incurred  plus  a  reasonable  profit.  For  most  non-U.S.  Government  contracts,  primarily international direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that  do  not  have  an  alternative  use  to  us  and  if  our  customer  were  to  terminate  the  contract  for  reasons  other  than  our  nonperformance  we  would  have  the  right  to  recover  damages  which  would  include,  among  other  potential  damages,  the  right  to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.",

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

Significant changes in U.S. government defense spending or changes in U.S. government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\nWe Face Risks Relating to Our U.S. Government Contracts and the Mix of Our U.S. Government Contracts and Programs that Could Negatively Impact our Financial Condition, Results of Operations, Liquidity and Overall Business. The termination of one or more of our contracts, or the occurrence of performance delays, cost overruns, product failures, materials or components shortages,  or  contract  definitization  delays,  could  negatively  impact  our  competitive  position,  results  of  operations,  financial condition and liquidity. U.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without  prior  notice,  at  the  U.S.  government's  convenience  or  for  default  based  on  performance.  If  one  of  our  contracts  is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for work accepted by the U.S. government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. In addition, we are a subcontractor on some contracts and the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, without regard to our performance as a subcontractor. We can give no assurance that we would be awarded new U.S. government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of the termination  of  any  of  our  contracts.  In  addition,  because  the  funding  of  U.S.  government  programs  is  subject  to  congressional appropriations made on a fiscal year basis even for multi-year programs, programs are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future years. Appropriation bills may be delayed, which may result in delays to funding, the collection of receivables and our contract performance due to lack of authorized funds to procure related products and services. Under certain circumstances, we may use our own funds to meet our customer's desired delivery dates or other requirements, but we may not be reimbursed. Further, if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable, reduced or delayed, the U.S. government may terminate for  convenience our contract or subcontract under that program. In addition, our U.S. government contracts typically involve  the  development,  application  and  manufacture  of  advanced  defense  and  technology  systems  and  products  aimed  at achieving  challenging  goals.  New  technologies  may  be  untested  or  unproven  and  in  some  instances,  product  requirements  or specifications may be modified. As a result, we may experience technological and other performance difficulties, which may result in delays, setbacks, cost overruns or product failures, and could divert our attention or resources from other projects. Our failure to execute effectively on our development programs could impact our future sales opportunities. Additionally, in order to win certain U.S. government contracts, we may be required to invest in development prior to award as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions. These additional investments may not be worthwhile if we are not chosen for these awards.\n\nOur U.S. government contracts are typically either fixed-priced contracts or cost reimbursement contracts. Fixed-price contracts are predominantly either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, we generally share with the U.S. government savings for cost underruns less than target costs and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated ceiling price. We carry the entire burden of cost overruns exceeding the ceiling price amount under FPI contracts. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed or performance-based fee, but  we  are  generally  not  reimbursed  for  unauthorized  costs  exceeding  a  cost  ceiling  amount  or  costs  not  allowable  under  the contract or applicable regulations. If we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, our profitability could be negatively affected, particularly under fixed-price development contracts. We may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenues, and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenues. While contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are  typically  cost  reimbursable,  they  can  be  FFP  or  FPI,  which  can  significantly  increase  our  risk  of  a  potential  negative  profit adjustment, as development contracts by nature involve elements that have not been undertaken before and, thus, are highly subject to  future  unexpected cost growth. In addition, other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production, which includes starting and stabilizing a manufacturing and test line while the final design is still being validated. Moreover, over the past several years, the DoD has increased its use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracts, under which it awards certain prototypes, research and production contracts without all of the procurement requirements that typically apply to DoD contracts, including justification of sole source awards. OTAs may use fixed-price contracts during all phases of the contract, or mandated contract  cost  sharing  (e.g.,  one-third  of  program  costs).  They  may  also  require  non-traditional  subcontractor  participation  and impose other requirements that differ from our other DoD contracts. Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to perform on our OTA contracts, including any applicable non-traditional requirements. Moreover, from time to time, we may begin performance under an undefinitized contract action with a not-to-exceed price prior to completing contract negotiations in order to support U.S. government priorities. Uncertainties in final contract price, specifications and terms, or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization, may negatively affect our profitability. In addition, as discussed more fully below, our U.S. government contracts also require us to comply with extensive and evolving procurement rules and regulations and subject us to potential U.S. government audits, investigations, and disputes.

      "answer": "Boeing values its fixed income securities primarily using matrix pricing or an income approach that converts future cash flows into a present value, which introduces model dependency for securities without active market quotes. Matrix pricing is also a key technique used for Level 2 securities, as shown in the second chunk, which includes asset-backed, corporate, and municipal bonds valued using observable inputs like yield curves. Lockheed Martin discloses that its Level 2 U.S. and international equity securities are valued using corroborated quotes, while its fixed income securities include collateralized investments funded through a loan secured by private equity holdings. This means Boeing's valuation incorporates more forward-looking assumptions, whereas Lockheed Martin's Level 2 disclosures emphasize market-corroborated pricing and specific collateral arrangements, reducing direct comparability between the two companies' investment portfolios due to differing valuation techniques and asset structures.",

      "answer": "UPS applies ASU 2020-04 to contract modifications in its logistics services, where changes that add distinct services are treated as separate contracts and those that don't are accounted for prospectively, affecting revenue recognition timing based on cost-to-cost or output methods. In contrast, GE applied the same standard to address the discontinuation of LIBOR, with contract modifications to replace reference rates occurring in 2021\u20132023, but found the financial impact to be immaterial. While both companies applied ASU 2020-04 to contract modifications, UPS's use centers on performance obligations and revenue timing in service delivery, whereas GE's application was tied to interest rate reference reform with minimal financial effect.",

ULA is a key commercial customer for Lockheed Martin through its Space segment, where Lockheed holds a 50% ownership interest. Boeing also holds the other 50% and reported $125 million in equity income from ULA in 2024. This suggests that ULA\u2019s financial performance is significant to both companies, and Lockheed\u2019s exposure to ULA through receivables and ownership could influence its contract asset management and overall liquidity. Therefore, any financial strain on ULA could affect both Lockheed\u2019s $665 million commercial receivables and Boeing\u2019s equity income.",

Net unfav orable cumulativ e contract catch-up adjustments were $2,328 million better than in 2022.\n\nSee further discussion of fixed-price contracts in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nBDS loss from operations includes our share of income from equity method inv estments of $125 million, $44 million and $13 million primarily from our United Launch Alliance and other joint v entures in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely.\n\n## Backlog\n\nT otal backlog of $64,023 million at December 31, 2024 was $5,011 million higher than December 31, 2023, reflecting the timing of awards, partially offset by rev enue recognized on contracts awarded in prior periods.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nOur BDS business includes a variety of dev elopment programs which hav e complex design and technical challenges. Some of these programs hav e cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily reduced award or incentiv e fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\n\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Examples of significant fixed-price dev elopment programs include Commercial Crew,  KC-46A  T anker,  MQ-25,  T -7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B,  and  commercial  and  military  satellites. A  number  of  our  ongoing  fixed-price  dev elopment programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also hav e risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during dev elopment, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result  in  a  material  charge  or  otherwise  adv ersely  affect  our  financial  condition.  T hese  programs  are  ongoing,  and  while  we  believ e  the  cost  and  fee estimates  incorporated  in  the  financial  statements  are  appropriate,  the  technical  complexity  of  these  programs  creates  financial  risk  as  additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled deliv ery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination prov isions or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\n\n## Global Services\n\n## Business Environment and Trends\n\nThe aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics and other inv entory serv ices; maintenance, engineering and upgrades; training and professional  serv ices;  and  data  analytics  and  digital  serv ices.  We  expect  BGS  commercial  rev enues  to  remain  strong  in  future  quarters  as  the commercial airline industry transitions from recov ery to growth.\n\nOver  the  long-term,  as  the  size  of  the  worldwide  commercial  airline  fleet  continues  to  grow ,  so  does  demand  for  aftermarket  serv ices  designed  to increase efficiency and extend the economic liv es of aircraft. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictiv e maintenance to improve their productiv ity and efficiency. Airlines continue to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inv entory, frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties.",

These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager.

Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days.

The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient.

Boeing discloses that its private debt and private equity NAV valuations are based on the valuation of underlying investments, including cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows, and market-based comparable data, with some funds reporting on a one-quarter lagged basis and adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. UPS, in its disclosures, notes that private debt and private equity funds typically have terms ranging between 10 and 15 years from inception, with limited redemption provisions until the end of the term, and as of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaled approximately $2.7 billion, expected to be contributed over the remaining investment period of three to six years.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $990 million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024. There are no expected required contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2025.\n\nThe following table presents estimated future benefit payments as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\n\n",

BA states that private debt NAV valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows, and market-based comparable data, and notes that these investments are typically reported on a one-quarter lagged basis and adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. Similarly, UPS values private debt at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, adjusted for investment activity between the date of the reports and year-end, and highlights that these investments generally have limited redemption provisions until the end of the partnership term (10\u201315 years).

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 2020 - $10.1 billion pre-tax actuarial loss related to benefit obligation:\n\n- Discount Rates ($7.3 billion pre-tax loss): The weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from 3.55% as of December 31, 2019 to 2.87% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decline in U.S. treasury yields that was slightly offset by an increase in credit spreads on AA-rated corporate bonds.\n- Coordinating benefits attributable to the Central States Pension Fund ($2.3 billion pre-tax loss): This represents our current best estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the Central States Pension Fund before taking into account the impact of the change in discount rates.\n- Demographic and Assumption Changes ($513 million pre-tax loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation changes, rates of termination, retirement, mortality and other changes.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Plan Assets\n\nPension assets are invested in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as investment guidelines established by plan trustees. The strategic asset mixes are specifically tailored for each plan given distinct factors, including liability and liquidity needs. Equities, alternative investments, and other higher yielding assets are utilized to generate returns and promote growth. Derivatives, repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements and fixed income securities are utilized as tools for duration management, mitigating interest rate risk, and minimizing funded status volatility.\n\nThe primary long-term investment objectives for pension assets are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital to meet future obligations while minimizing risk exposures and reducing funded status volatility. To meet these objectives, investment managers are engaged to actively manage assets within the guidelines and strategies set forth by the Investment Committee. Active managers are monitored regularly and their performance is compared to applicable benchmarks. As a result of our long-term U.S. investment objectives for pension assets, the weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on assets decreased from 7.77% during 2020 to 6.50% in 2021.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nPlan assets valued utilizing Level 1 inputs include equity investments, corporate debt instruments and U.S. government securities. Fair values were determined by closing prices for those securities traded on national stock exchanges, while securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on the valuation date are valued at the mean between the last reported bid and ask prices.\n\nLevel 2 assets include fixed income securities that are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of other issues with similar credit ratings; mortgage-backed securities that are valued based on cash flow and yield models using acceptable modeling and pricing conventions; and certain investments that are pooled with other investments in a commingled fund. We value our investments in commingled funds by taking the percentage ownership of the underlying assets, each of which has a readily determinable fair value.\n\nFair value estimates for certain investments are based on unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by observable market data and are thus classified as Level 3.\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a net asset value (\"NAV\") or its equivalent developed consistent with FASB measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, risk parity funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds and risk parity funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31st. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two to three month notice period,",

This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021. Subsequently in March 2021, the FCA announced some USD LIBOR tenors (overnight, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and 12 month) will continue to be published until June 30, 2023. Regulators in the U.S. and other jurisdictions have been working to replace these rates with alternative reference interest rates that are supported by transactions in liquid and observable markets, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for USD LIBOR. Currently, our credit facility and certain of our derivative instruments reference LIBOR-based rates. Our credit facility contains  provisions  specifying  alternative  interest  rate  calculations  to  be  employed  when  LIBOR  ceases  to  be  available  as  a benchmark and we have adhered to the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, which will govern our derivatives upon the final cessation of USD LIBOR. ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on  Financial  Reporting ,  as  amended,  helps  limit  the  accounting  impact  from  contract  modifications,  including  hedging relationships, due to the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates that are completed by December 31, 2022. We do not expect a significant impact to our operating results, financial position or cash flows from the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates, but we will continue to monitor the impact of this transition until it is completed.\n\nBusiness Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\n\nIn  October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires entities to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities  acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) .  The update will generally result in an entity recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at amounts consistent with those recorded by the acquiree immediately before the acquisition date rather than at fair value. The new standard is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2022. The adoption of the new standard did not have an impact to our operating results, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities About Government Assistance\n\nIn  November  2021,  the  FASB  issued ASU  2021-10, Government Assistance  (Topic  832) , Disclosures  by  Business  Entities About Government Assistance, which requires entities to provide disclosures on material government assistance transactions for annual reporting periods. The disclosures include information around the nature of the assistance, the related accounting policies used  to  account  for  government  assistance,  the  effect  of  government  assistance  on  the  entity's  financial  statements,  and  any significant terms and conditions of the agreements, including commitments and contingencies. The new standard is effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2022 and only impacts annual financial statement footnote disclosures. Therefore, the adoption will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 2 - Pending Acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.\n\nOn December 20, 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (Aerojet Rocketdyne) for $51.00 per share, which is net of a $5.00 per share special cash dividend Aerojet Rocketdyne paid to its stockholders on March 24, 2021. At the time of announcement, this represented a post-dividend equity value of approximately $4.6 billion, on a fully diluted as-converted  basis,  and  a  transaction  value  of  approximately  $4.4  billion  after  the  assumption  of  Aerojet  Rocketdyne's  thenprojected net cash. If the transaction is completed, we expect to finance the acquisition primarily through new debt issuances. The transaction was approved by Aerojet Rocketdyne's stockholders on March 9, 2021. As part of the regulatory review process of the transaction,  on  September  24,  2021,  we  and Aerojet  Rocketdyne  each  certified  substantial  compliance  with  the  Federal  Trade Commission's (FTC) requests for additional information, known as a 'second request.' On January 11, 2022, the parties provided an updated notice of their intended closing date under their timing agreement with the FTC, whereby the parties agreed that they would not close the transaction before January 27, 2022, to enable the parties to discuss the scope and nature of the merchant supply and firewall commitments previously offered to the FTC by Lockheed Martin. We have been advised by the FTC that its concerns regarding the transaction cannot be addressed adequately by the terms of a consent order. We believe it is highly likely that the FTC will vote to sue to block the transaction and expect they will make a decision before January 27, 2022. If the FTC sues to block the transaction, we could elect to defend the lawsuit within 30 days or terminate the merger agreement. If the FTC does not file a lawsuit to block the transaction before January 27, 2022, the parties could proceed to close the transaction, but there is no assurance that the FTC would not file a lawsuit",

Similarly, GE\u2019s floating-rate debt and preferred stock will transition to SOFR plus a spread adjustment under New York law, with any financial impact also being accounted for under ASU 2020-04.

          "chunk_text": "\nOur most significant contractual ratings requirements are related to ordinary course commercial activities. The timing within the quarter of the potential liquidity impact of these areas may differ, as can the remedies to resolving any potential breaches of required ratings levels.\n\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISKS. As a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such principal currencies include the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Indian rupee and Japanese yen, among others. The effects of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings, excluding the earnings impact of the underlying hedged item, was less than $0.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 , 2020 and 2019. This analysis excludes any offsetting effect from the forecasted future transactions that are economically hedged. See Note 20 for further information about our risk exposures, our use of derivatives, and the effects of this activity on our financial statements.\n\nExchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques, including selective use of derivatives. We apply policies to manage each of these risks, including prohibitions on speculative activities. It is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies. To test the effectiveness of our hedging actions, for interest rate risk we assumed that, on January 1, 2022, interest rates decreased by 100 basis points and the decrease remained in place for the next 12 months and for currency risk of assets and liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies, we evaluated the effect of a 10% shift in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (USD). The analyses indicated that our 2021 consolidated net earnings would decline by $0.1 billion for interest rate risk and less than $0.1 billion for foreign exchange risk.\n\nLIBOR REFORM. In connection with the transition away from the use of the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) as an interest rate benchmark, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA) plans to cease the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. The Company's most significant exposures to LIBOR relate to preferred stock and certain floating-rate debt securities issued by the Company, which use USD LIBOR. Such preferred stock and floating rate debt are governed by New York law.\n\nOn April 6, 2021, New York State legislation addressing the cessation of USD LIBOR was signed into law, which provides a statutory remedy for contracts that include contractual fallback language that requires the selection of a benchmark replacement rate based on USD LIBOR, such as our floating rate debt and preferred stock. On the date USD LIBOR permanently ceases to be published or is announced to no longer be representative, our floating rate debt and preferred stock will be deemed to be replaced by the 'recommended benchmark replacement', which is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus a spread adjustment.\n\nAdditionally, with respect to our derivatives portfolio, we are managing the transition from LIBOR based on industry-wide LIBOR reform efforts, including the LIBOR protocols issued by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.\n\nWe are in the process of managing the transition, and any financial impact will be accounted for under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting .\n\n## STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\n\nCASH FLOWS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. The most significant source of cash in CFOA is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from equipment or services sales. The most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities, and post retirement plans. GE measures itself on a free cash flows* basis. This metric includes CFOA plus investments in property, plant and equipment and additions to internal-use software; this metric excludes any cash received from dispositions of property, plant and equipment. We believe that investors may also find it useful to compare free cash flows* performance without the effects of cash flows for taxes related to business sales, contributions to the GE Pension Plan, discontinued factoring programs, operating activities related to our run-off Insurance business and eliminations related to our receivables factoring and supply chain finance programs. We believe this measure will better allow management and investors to evaluate the capacity of our operations to generate free cash flows.\n\nThe CFOA impact from factoring programs discontinued in 2021 of $(5,108) million represents the cash that our industrial businesses would have otherwise collected in the nine months ended December 31, 2021 had customer receivables not been previously sold to WCS or third parties in those discontinued programs. The CFOA impact associated with this activity in factoring programs that have now been discontinued was $(5,847) million and $(3,361) million in the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $(2,487) million. The CFOA impact for the three months ended December 31, 2020 was $(1,377) million. The CFOA impact from receivables factoring and supply chain finance eliminations represents activity related to those internal programs previously facilitated for our industrial segments by our Working Capital Solutions business. We completed the exit from all internal factoring and supply chain finance programs in 2021 and therefore expect no future elimination activity related to these programs.",

      "answer": "MMM generated $5.928 billion (17.3% of total worldwide sales) from its operations in EMEA in 2022. MetLife actively markets life insurance products in the EMEA region as part of its ongoing business operations, offering them to individuals and corporations alongside retirement and health insurance products. In contrast, BA provides life insurance primarily as a postretirement benefit to certain employee groups, rather than as an actively marketed product. This represents a fundamental difference in the role life insurance plays in each organization's strategy - as a core revenue-generating offering for MetLife versus a supplementary employee benefit for BA.",

Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards and/or potentially required sustainability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, is costly and technologically challenging. These  challenges  are  particularly  significant  with  newer  aircraft  programs.  Any  failure  of  any  Boeing  aircraft  to  satisfy  performance  or  reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower rev enues.\n\nChanges  in  levels  of  U.S.  government  defense  spending  or  acquisition  priorities,  as  well  as  significant  delays  in  U.S.  government appropriations, could negatively impact our business, financial position and results of operations.\n\nWe derive a substantial portion of our rev enue from the U.S. gov ernment, primarily from defense related programs with the United States Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) and contracts with other gov ernment agencies, including NASA. Lev els of U.S. defense spending are v ery difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such as the ev olv ing nature of the national security threat env ironment, U.S. national security strategy, U.S. foreign policy,  the  domestic  political  env ironment,  macroeconomic  conditions  and  the  ability  of  the  U.S.  gov ernment  to  enact  relev ant  legislation  such  as authorization and appropriations bills. The gov ernment may also constrain discretionary spending by instituting enforceable spending caps.\n\nThe  timeliness  of  annual  appropriations  for  U.S.  gov ernment  departments  and  agencies  remains  a  recurrent  risk.  Congress  may  fund  gov ernment departments  and  agencies  with  one  or  more  continuing  resolutions,  which  could  delay  new  programs  or  competitions  and/or  negativ ely  impact  the execution of certain program activ ities. A lapse in appropriations for gov ernment departments or agencies would result in a full or partial gov ernment shutdown,  which  could  impact  our  operations.  In  the  ev ent  of  a  prolonged  shutdown,  requirements  to  furlough  employees  in  the  U.S.  DoD,  the Department of Transportation, including the FAA, or other gov ernment agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to deliv er commercial airplanes or perform work on existing contracts, delays in the certification of new aircraft or otherwise impact our operations, negativ ely impact future orders, and/or cause other disruptions or delays. There is uncertainty regarding which gov ernment functions would shut down or continue operations during a lapse in appropriations, and corresponding uncertainty regarding the extent or magnitude of potential impacts to our operations. For additional information  on  U.S.  gov ernment  appropriations  and  budgets,  see  'Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of Operations - Additional Considerations - U.S. Gov ernment Funding' on page 31 of this Form 10-K.\n\nIn  addition, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to future acquisition priorities and program-lev el appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies (including NASA), including changes to national security and defense priorities, and tension between modernization inv estments, sustainment inv estments, and inv estments in new technologies or emergent capabilities. Future inv estment priority changes or budget cuts, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs or future program opportunities. Any of these impacts could hav e a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nAs a result of the significant  ongoing  uncertainty  with  respect  to  both  U.S.  defense  spending  and  the  ev olv ing  nature  of  the  national  security  threat environment, we also expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize affordability, innov ation, cybersecurity and deliv ery of technical data and software in its procurement processes, including the implementation of cybersecurity compliance requirements on the Defense Industrial Base, for which the supply chain may not be fully prepared. If we and our suppliers are unable to adjust to these changing acquisition priorities and policies, our rev enues and market share could be impacted.",

Similarly, UNP's investments in real estate partnerships totaling $5 million at year-end 2023 are also valued based on the partnerships' audited financial statements, aligning with the NAV methodology. UPS clarifies that limited partnerships typically have 10\u201315 year terms with limited redemption rights until maturity, and GD\u2019s Real Estate Funds show net purchases and sales activity, indicating some level of ongoing liquidity management. UNP also discloses future commitments to real estate partnerships, though at a much smaller scale compared to the $3.3 billion in unfunded commitments noted by UPS, suggesting differing liquidity profiles between the two companies.",

In contrast, EMR only pays dividend equivalents on performance shares after the three-year performance period concludes and payout is earned, with compensation expense recognized based on expected shares to be earned. This reflects different approaches to equity compensation with CAT using fixed fair value at grant and EMR tying both value and dividend payout to performance outcomes.",

      "answer": "GD uses valuation models with observable inputs such as interest rates and bond yields for its Level 2 fixed-income securities, which include fixed-rate notes and cash flow hedges, totaling $7,700 million in fair value. These models rely on market data and quoted prices for similar assets. In contrast, LMT's real estate funds, which are valued using NAV based on valuation models, incorporate unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated with market data, as noted in their 2023 disclosures. This distinction highlights that while GD's Level 2 assets depend on observable market factors, LMT's real estate funds rely on more subjective, unobservable inputs for valuation.",

        "Hop 1: GD \u2192 Valuation Models: GD uses valuation models with observable inputs like interest rates and bond yields for its Level 2 assets, which include fixed-income securities and cash flow hedges valued at $7,700 million.",
        "Hop 2: Valuation Models \u2192 Real Estate Funds: The valuation models referenced by GD are similar in methodology to those used for LMT's real estate funds, which also rely on NAV-based valuations.",

      "question": "How did the adoption of ASU 2022-06 specifically impact General Dynamics' accounting treatment for contract modifications tied to customer-directed scope changes, and how does this align with the broader application of the standard as outlined in Caterpillar's regulatory filings?",
      "answer": "General Dynamics frequently requests contract modifications due to customer-directed scope changes and treats any excess of preestablished trade-in prices above fair market value as a reduction of revenue. The adoption of ASU 2022-06 extended relief for contract modifications affected by reference rate reform, such as those involving LIBOR, through December 31, 2024. This allowed GD to apply optional expedients to modifications made between March 12, 2020, and the end of 2024 without requiring full retrospective GAAP application. Caterpillar also adopted ASU 2022-06, listing it among key accounting standards impacting their financial reporting, particularly for reference rate reform. While GD applied the standard to ongoing contract adjustments, Caterpillar's inclusion of ASU 2022-06 in their regulatory filings indicates parallel adoption of the extended relief, though no direct business relationship or shared contract modifications between GD and CAT are disclosed.",

        "Hop 1: GD \u2192 Contract Modifications: GD disclosed that they routinely request contract modifications due to customer-directed scope changes and treat trade-in valuations as revenue reductions, with $1.6 billion in letters of credit and guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Contract Modifications \u2192 ASU 2022-06: ASU 2022-06 extended the sunset date for reference rate reform relief to December 31, 2024, allowing companies like GD to apply optional expedients for contract modifications replacing reference rates affected by reform, such as LIBOR.",
        "Hop 3: ASU 2022-06 \u2190 CAT: Caterpillar listed ASU 2022-06 among key accounting standards it adopted, indicating alignment with the broader application of the standard, though no specific contract modifications or financial impacts were detailed in their filings."

      "answer": "HON's Real Estate Funds, which had a balance of $16 million at the end of 2023, are valued using NAV based on periodic appraisals and valuation models, with fund terms typically lasting 8\u201310 years. Similarly, GD categorizes its Level 3 assets\u2014measured using unobservable inputs\u2014as relying on valuation models not corroborated by market data. Both companies use NAV as a practical expedient for fund valuation, though HON\u2019s Real Estate Funds specifically involve real estate partnerships where NAV is informed by appraisals, while GD\u2019s Level 3 assets include direct private equity investments. This indicates a shared reliance on internally derived valuation techniques for less liquid, long-term investments.",

      "question": "How might potential delays in FAA certification of Gulfstream's G700 aircraft impact FedEx's compliance costs under ICAO's 2028 production cutoff for non-compliant aircraft, given FedEx's reliance on fuel-efficient fleets to manage CORSIA obligations?",
      "answer": "Delays in FAA certification of Gulfstream's G700 aircraft could limit FedEx\u2019s ability to acquire newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft before the 2028 cutoff date for non-compliant models, potentially increasing FedEx\u2019s CORSIA compliance costs. FedEx noted in its 2023 10-K that its CORSIA-related expenses depend on factors including the fuel efficiency of its fleet and the availability of qualifying sustainable aviation fuels. Gulfstream\u2019s 2023 inventory ramp-up for the G700 was explicitly tied to FAA certification timing, meaning a delay could slow the introduction of next-generation aircraft into FedEx\u2019s fleet. This would prolong the use of older, less-efficient aircraft, increasing the company\u2019s carbon offset or allowance purchase obligations under CORSIA and ETS, especially as free allowances are phased out by 2026.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: FDX \u2192 FAA Certification: FedEx is subject to FAA certification requirements for aircraft compliance with ICAO emissions standards, which apply to new deliveries starting in 2023 and will fully phase in by 2028. FedEx expects compliance with CORSIA and ETS to increase operating costs, with fleet fuel efficiency being a key factor.",
        "Hop 2: FAA Certification \u2192 G700 Aircraft: Gulfstream\u2019s G700 aircraft production ramp-up in 2023 was directly tied to anticipated FAA certification, which is necessary for delivery and fleet modernization. A delay would slow the availability of this next-generation aircraft model.",
        "Hop 3: G700 Aircraft \u2190 GD: Gulfstream (a division of GD) is actively increasing inventories and receiving customer deposits for the G700 in anticipation of FAA certification. This indicates the aircraft is a key future product for customers seeking modern, efficient fleets."

We aspire to achieve zero workplace injuries and provide a safe, open and accountable work environment for our employees. We provide several channels for all employees to speak up, ask for guidance and report concerns related to ethics or safety violations. We address employee concerns and take appropriate actions that uphold our Boeing values.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe  commercial  jet  aircraft  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  We  face  aggressive international  competitors  who  are  intent  on  increasing  their  market  share,  such  as  Airbus  and  other  entrants  from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with higher quality products.\n\nBDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Technologies Corporation, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their  North American  operations  and  partnering  with  U.S.  defense  companies.  In  addition,  certain  competitors  have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2022.\n\nThe commercial and defense services markets are extremely challenging and are made up of many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering products and services which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial airplane programs: training, fleet services and logistics, maintenance and engineering, modifications and upgrades, as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. BGS expects the market to remain highly competitive in 2022, and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\nOur businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We work with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to, all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.\n\nGovernment Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our  U.S.  government  contracts  were  to  be  terminated  for  convenience,  we  generally  would  be  entitled  to  receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.\n\nCommercial  Aircraft. In  the  U.S.,  our  commercial  aircraft  products  are  required  to  comply  with  FAA  regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. New aircraft models and new derivative aircraft are required to obtain FAA certification prior to entry into  service.  Outside  the  U.S.,  similar  requirements  exist  for  airworthiness,  installation  and  operational  approvals. These requirements are generally",

We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.\n\n## REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts provide a fixed fee that is negotiated at the inception of the contract and does not vary with actual costs.\n\nWe assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If  combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.\n\nWe evaluate  the  products  or  services  promised  in  each  contract  at  inception  to  determine  whether  the  contract  should  be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have  more  than  one  distinct  performance  obligation,  which  occurs  when  we  perform  activities  that  are  not  highly  complex  or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.\n\nWe determine the transaction  price  for  each  contract  based  on  the  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  for  the  products  or services being provided under the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary, we estimate variable consideration at  the  most  likely  amount,  which  is  included  in  the  transaction  price  to  the  extent  it  is  probable  that  a  significant  reversal  of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.\n\nAt the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently  modified  to  include  changes  in  specifications,  requirements  or  price,  which  may  create  new  or  change  existing enforceable  rights  and  obligations.  Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  modification,  we  consider  whether  to  account  for  the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. Therefore,  such  modifications  are  accounted  for  as  if  they  were  part  of  the  existing  contract  and  recognized  as  a  cumulative adjustment to revenue.\n\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other  products  or  services).  Our  contracts  with  the  U.S.  Government,  including  FMS  contracts,  are  subject  to  the  Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.\n\nFor non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer's specifications.  When  it  is  necessary  to  allocate  the  transaction  price  to  multiple  performance  obligations,  we  typically  use  the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.\n\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For most contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience  and  pay  us  for  costs  incurred  plus  a  reasonable  profit.  For  most  non-U.S.  Government  contracts,  primarily international direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that  do  not  have  an  alternative  use  to  us  and  if  our  customer  were  to  terminate  the  contract  for  reasons  other  than  our  nonperformance  we  would  have  the  right  to  recover  damages  which  would  include,  among  other  potential  damages,  the  right  to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.",

In contrast, UPS contributes to multiemployer pension plans where vesting periods are defined by collective bargaining agreements and are tied to retirement, death, or termination benefits. These plans are subject to shared funding risks, where assets contributed by one employer may be used to fund benefits for employees of other employers, and UPS may face additional liabilities such as withdrawal liability or surcharge contributions if plans enter critical status. This highlights a fundamental difference in both the structure and risk exposure of vesting mechanisms between EMR\u2019s equity-based compensation and UPS\u2019s pension obligations.",

Restricted stock awards involve distribution of common stock to key management employees subject to cliff vesting at the end of service periods ranging from three to ten years while restricted stock units granted to employees cliff vest at the end of a three-year period. The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the average of the high and low market prices of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, with compensation expense recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period. In 2022, approximately 116,000 shares of restricted stock vested as a result of participants fulfilling the applicable service requirements.

MULTIEMPLOYER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\n\nWe contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees. These plans generally provide for retirement, death and/or termination benefits for eligible employees within the applicable collective bargaining units, based on specific eligibility and participation requirements, vesting periods and benefit formulas. The risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following respects:\n\n- Assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.\n- If we negotiate to cease participating in a multiemployer plan, we may be required to pay that plan an amount based on our allocable share of its underfunded status, referred to as a \"withdrawal liability\". However, cessation of participation in a multiemployer plan and subsequent payment of any withdrawal liability is subject to the collective bargaining process.\n- If any of the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate enter critical status, and our contributions are not sufficient to satisfy any rehabilitation plan funding schedule, we could be required under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 to make additional surcharge contributions to the multiemployer pension plan in the amount of five to ten percent of the existing contributions required by our labor agreement. Such surcharges would cease upon the ratification of a new collective bargaining agreement and could not recur unless a plan re-entered critical status at a later date.\n\nThe discussion that follows sets forth the financial impact on our results of operations and cash flows for December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, from our participation in multiemployer benefit plans. As part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit levels, we have agreed to contribute certain amounts to the multiemployer benefit plans during the contract period. The multiemployer benefit plans set benefit levels and are responsible for benefit delivery to participants. Future contributions to multiemployer benefit plans are determined only through collective bargaining, and we have no additional legal or constructive obligation to increase contributions beyond the agreed-upon amounts (except potential surcharges under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 described above).\n\nThe number of employees covered by our multiemployer pension plans has increased with the growth in our business. There have been no other significant changes that affect the comparability of 2021, 2020 and 2019 contributions. We recognize expense for the contractually-required contribution for each period, and we recognize a liability for any contributions due and unpaid at the end of a reporting period.\n\n## Status of Collective Bargaining Agreements\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 327,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the Teamsters. These agreements run through July 31, 2023.\n\nWe have approximately 3,200 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association (\"IPA\"). This collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable September 1, 2023.\n\nWe have approximately 1,700 airline mechanics who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727 which becomes amendable November 1, 2023. In addition, approximately 3,300 of our auto and maintenance mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (\"IAM\"). The collective bargaining agreement with the IAM runs through July 31, 2024.\n\n## Multiemployer Pension Plans\n\nThe following table outlines our participation in multiemployer pension plans for December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, and sets forth our calendar year contributions and accruals for each plan. The 'EIN/Pension Plan Number' column provides the Employer Identification Number ('EIN') and the three-digit plan number. The most recent Pension Protection Act zone status available in 2021 and 2020 relates to the plans' two most recent fiscal year ends. The zone status is based on information that we received from the plans' administrators and is certified by each plan's actuary. Plans certified in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded; plans certified in the orange zone are both less than 80% funded and have an accumulated funding deficiency, or are expected to have a deficiency in any of the next six plan years; plans certified in the yellow zone are less than 80% funded; and plans certified in the green zone are at least 80% funded. The 'FIP / RP Status Pending / Implemented' column indicates whether a financial improvement plan ('FIP') for yellow/orange zone plans, or a rehabilitation plan ('RP') for red zone plans, is either",

      "question": "How does the voting structure of UPS's Class B Common Stock impact potential amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation, and how does this compare to the incorporation disclosure framework under which 3M (MMM) operates?",
      "answer": "UPS's Class B Common Stock has limited voting rights, specifically excluding holders from general voting but allowing them to vote on certain defined matters, including amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation that affect the terms of Class B or C common stock. This structure gives Class B shareholders a targeted role in corporate governance decisions that directly affect their equity terms. In contrast, 3M (MMM) discloses its Certificate of Incorporation as part of its regulatory filings, indicating a standard compliance framework without specific shareholder class distinctions in voting rights related to incorporation amendments. Therefore, while UPS embeds class-specific voting into its incorporation governance, MMM's framework appears more generalized and not tied to differentiated shareholder voting rights for such amendments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS \u2192 Class B Common Stock: UPS discloses that it has 726 shares of Class B common stock issued in 2023, which have limited voting rights, particularly for amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation that affect their terms.",
        "Hop 2: Class B Common Stock \u2192 Certificate of Incorporation: The Certificate of Incorporation outlines that amendments affecting the terms of Class B or C common stock require a separate class vote, giving these shareholders a defined role in governance.",
        "Hop 3: Certificate of Incorporation \u2190 MMM: 3M (MMM) discloses its Certificate of Incorporation as part of its regulatory filings, indicating a standard compliance framework without class-specific voting rights tied to incorporation amendments."

      "answer": "3M transferred certain liabilities to Solventum as part of the spin-off, including those related to the Bair Hugger and Federal False Claims Act/Qui Tam Litigation, with Solventum assuming indemnification and defense obligations. 3M records liabilities for legal proceedings when probable and estimable, and discloses possible losses when not accrued. Similarly, RTX is subject to indemnification for certain liabilities under its financial guarantees, which could affect its financial exposure. Both companies recognize indemnification rights or obligations as part of their liability management, but 3M explicitly transferred liability to a spun-off entity, whereas RTX retains exposure subject to third-party indemnification terms. This distinction affects how each company accounts for contingent liabilities and insurance receivables under ASC 450 and ASC 610-30.",

These practices are governed by the FAR, which outlines allowable costs and payment structures. Honeywell, also subject to the FAR, faces unique risks such as the U.S. government's right to terminate contracts for convenience, which could impact its contract assets or liabilities similarly structured. Both companies are bound by the same FAR-regulated payment and cost frameworks, but Honeywell's risk profile includes potential contract termination that could disrupt revenue already recognized under FAR-compliant accounting practices.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nproviding services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment.  Such  advances  are  not  considered  a  significant  financing  component  because  they  are  used  to  meet  working  capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress, as sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of performing services under the contract is incurred on an other-than-straight-line basis. For some of our long-term aftermarket contracts, we receive payment prior to delivery of products and services, resulting in a contract liability balance, while for others, we deliver products or services in advance of payment, resulting in a contract asset balance.\n\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services that are not distinct are accounted for as part of the existing contract either on a cumulative catch-up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification.\n\nLoss provisions on contracts are recognized to the extent that estimated contract costs exceed the estimated consideration from the products or services contemplated under the contractual arrangement. For new commitments, we generally record loss provisions at contract signing except for certain contracts under which losses are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates us to perform. For existing commitments, anticipated losses on contractual arrangements are recognized in the period in which losses become evident. In estimating losses, products contemplated under contractual arrangements include firm quantities of product sold under contract and, in the commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, future highly probable sales of replacement parts required by regulation that are expected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment. In our commercial engine  and  wheels  and  brakes  businesses,  when  the  OEM  product  is  sold  for  a  loss,  but  the  combined  OEM  and  aftermarket arrangement for each individual sales campaign is profitable, we record OEM product losses at the time of product delivery.\n\nWe review our Estimate at Completion (EACs) on significant contracts on a periodic basis and for others, no less than annually or when  a  change  in  circumstances  warrant  a  modification  to  a  previous  estimate.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  work  required  to  be performed on many of the Company's performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks  and  opportunities  relate  to  management's  judgment  about  the  ability  and  cost  to  achieve  the  schedule,  consideration  of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or  aircraft  landings,  and  related  variable  consideration.  Management's  judgment  related  to  these  considerations  has  become increasingly more significant given the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity  and  scope  of  the  work  to  be  performed,  the  availability  and  cost  of  materials,  the  length  of  time  to  complete  the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives  of  components,  among  others.  Cost  estimates  may  also  include  the  estimated  cost  of  satisfying  our  industrial  cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts primarily within our RIS and RMD",

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment;  (ii)  the  failure  to  integrate  multiple  acquired  businesses  into  Honeywell  simultaneously  and  on  schedule  and/or  to achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties, cybersecurity concerns, compliance issues, or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or, with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification.\n\nOur future  growth  is  largely  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  develop  new  technologies  and  introduce  new  products  that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins.\n\nOur future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target end-markets; (ii) develop and maintain competitive products; (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors, including many new and non-traditional competitors; (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products; (v)  develop,  manufacture,  and  bring  compelling  new  products  to  market  quickly  and  cost-effectively;  (vi)  monitor  disruptive technologies  and  business  models;  (vii)  achieve  sufficient  return  on  investment  for  new  products  introduced  based  on  capital expenditures and research and development spending; (viii) respond to changes in overall trends related to end-market demand; and  (ix)  attract,  develop,  and  retain  individuals  with  the  requisite  technical  expertise  and  understanding  of  customers'  needs  to develop  new  technologies  and  introduce  new  products.  Competitors  may  also  develop  after-market  services  and  parts  for  our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.\n\nFailure  to  increase  productivity  through  sustainable  operational  improvements,  as  well  as  an  inability  to  successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses.\n\nOur profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. We seek productivity and cost savings  benefits  through  repositioning  actions  and  projects,  such  as  consolidation  of  manufacturing  facilities,  transitions  to  costcompetitive regions, and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements, and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed, and these actions may potentially  disrupt  our  operations.  In  addition,  organizational  changes,  increased  attrition,  failure  to  create  and  implement  a succession plan for key Company positions, not retaining key talent, inability to attract new employees with unique skills, trends in rising labor costs and labor availability, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations.\n\nAs a supplier to the U.S. government, we are subject to unique risks, such as the right of the U.S. government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance.\n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future.\n\nWe are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could  be  suspended  from  bidding  on  or  receiving  awards  of  new  government  contracts,  suspended  from  contract  performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

          "chunk_text": "RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, primarily investment securities and derivatives, fair v alue is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability  in an orderly  transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. See Note 21 for further information.\n\nDebt Securities. When available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of debt securities which are included in Level 1. For our remaining debt securities, we obtain pricing information from an independent pricing vendor. The inputs and assumptions to the pricing vendor's models are derived from market observable sources including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other marketrelated data. These investments are included in Level 2. Our pricing vendors may also provide us with valuations that are based on significant unobservable inputs, and in those circumstances, we classify the investment securities in Level 3.\n\nAnnually, we conduct reviews of our primary pricing vendor to validate that the inputs used in that vendor's pricing process are deemed to be market observable as defined in the standard. We believe that the prices received from our pricing vendor are representative of prices that would be received to sell the assets at the measurement date (exit prices) and are classified appropriately in the hierarchy. We use non-binding broker quotes and other third-party pricing services as our primary basis for valuation when there is limited, or no, relevant market activity for a specific instrument or for other instruments that share similar characteristics. Debt securities priced in this manner are included in Level 3.\n\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values . These publicly traded equity securities are valued using quoted prices and are included in Level 1.\n\nDerivatives. The majority of our derivatives are valued using internal models. The models maximize the use of market observable inputs including interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 2 primarily represent interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency and commodity forward and option contracts.\n\nInvestments in private equity, real estate and collective funds held within our pension plans or run-off insurance operations . M ost inv estments are generally valued using the net asset value (NA V ) per share as a practical expedient for fair value provided certain criteria are met. The NA V s are determined based on the fair v alues of the underly ing inv estments in the funds. Inv estments that are measured at fair value using the NA V  practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair v alue hierarchy . Inv estments classified within Lev el 3 primarily  relate to real estate and priv ate equities which are v alued using unobserv able inputs, primarily by discounting expected future cash flows, using comparative market multiples, third-party pricing sources, or a combination of these approaches as appropriate. See Notes 3 and 13 for further information.\n\nNONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets may include loans and longliv ed assets reduced to fair value upon classification as held for sale, impaired loans based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, impaired equity securities without readily determinable fair value, equity method investments and long-lived assets and remeasured retained investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in the deconsolidation of that subsidiary and retention of a noncontrolling stake in the entity. Assets written down to fair value when impaired and retained investments are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.\n\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair value and Associated companies. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value and associated companies are valued using market observable data such as transaction prices when available. When market observable data is unavailable, investments are valued using either a discounted cash flow model, comparative market multiples, third-party pricing sources or a combination of these approaches as appropriate. These investments are generally included in Level 3.\n\nLong-lived Assets . Fair v alues of long-liv ed assets are primarily  deriv ed internally  and are based on observed sales transactions for similar assets or discounted cash flow estimates. In other instances for which we do not have comparable observed sales transaction data, collateral values are developed internally and corroborated by external appraisal information. A djustments to third-party valuations may be performed in circumstances where market comparables are not specific to the attributes of the specific collateral or appraisal information may not be reflective of current market conditions due to the passage of time and the occurrence of market events since receipt of the information.\n\nADOPTIONS OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50) Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations . This guidance requires disclosures for supply chain finance programs using a retrospective approach, except for the annual roll-forward which is applicable prospectively in the period beginning January 1, 2024. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn 2024, we adopted ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , on a retrospective basis. The amendments are intended to increase reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.

This ASU requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

Supplier Finance Program Obligations\n\nUnder supplier finance programs, 3M agrees to pay participating banks the stated amount of confirmed invoices from its designated suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices, generally within 90 days of the invoice date. 3M or the banks may terminate the agreements with advance notice. Separately, the banks may have arrangements with the suppliers that provide them the option to request early payment from the banks for invoices confirmed by 3M. 3M's outstanding balances of confirmed invoices in the programs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. These amounts are included within accounts payable on 3M's consolidated balance sheet. The activity in 2024 included approximately $1.5 billion of invoices confirmed and $1.5 billion of invoices paid and other adjustments.\n\n## NOTE 17. Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3M's financial position and performance.\n\nAdditional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:\n\n- Impact on other comprehensive income of non-derivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 9.\n- Fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 18.\n- Derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company's long-term debt are also described in Note 14.\n\nRefer to the section below titled Location on Statement of Income (Loss) and Impact of Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments for details on the location within the consolidated statements of income (loss) for amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow or fair value hedges (along with similar information relative to the hedged items) and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Additional information relative to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included below as applicable.\n\nCash Flow Hedges: For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts: The Company may enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of ex change rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The Company may de-designate a cash flow hedge if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable, if 3M determines that the hedge is no longer expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction, or in certain other circumstances. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income for de-designated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in the value of derivative instruments after de-designation are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments section below. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Interest Rate Contracts: The Company may use forward starting interest rate contracts and treasury rate lock contracts to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments on forecasted debt issuances.\n\nThe amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the gain/(loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had a balance of $15 million associated with the after-tax net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). This includes a remaining balance of $80 million (after-tax loss) related to forward starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock contracts terminated in 2019 concurrent with associated debt issuances, which is being amortized over the respective lives of the underlying notes. Based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, of the total after-tax net unrealized balance as of December 31, 2024, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $44 million after-tax  net unrealized gain over the nex t 12 months (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).",

In contrast, General Electric evaluated the financial impact of the cessation of USD LIBOR rates in accordance with ASU 2020-04 and similarly concluded that the overall effect on its financial statements was immaterial.

The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, with certain exceptions. ASU 2021-01 amends the scope of the recent reference rate reform guidance. New optional expedients allow derivative instruments impacted by changes in the interest rate used for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment to qualify for certain optional relief. The amendments in ASU 2022-06 extend the sunset date of the reference rate reform optional expedients and exceptions to December 31, 2024. | Effective for contract modifications made between March 12, 2020 and December 31, 2024. | The guidance has reduced the operational and financial impacts of contract modifications that replace a reference rate, such as London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR'), affected by reference rate reform. Contract modifications to replace reference rates affected by the reform occurred during 2021, 2022 and 2023.

      "question": "How does Boeing's use of third-party aircraft value publications for valuing impaired customer financing assets compare to RTX's quarterly valuation methodology for private equity limited partnerships, particularly in terms of reliance on unobservable inputs?",
      "answer": "Boeing derives the fair value of impaired customer financing assets, including operating lease equipment, by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third-party aircraft value publications, which are based on market trades and other market factors. Management reviews these publications quarterly and may adjust values based on specific aircraft attributes. In contrast, RTX values private equity limited partnerships quarterly using discounted cash flows, earnings multiples, and market multiples, with valuation adjustments reflecting changes in operating results or financial condition of the portfolio companies. Both approaches rely on unobservable inputs typical of Level 3 assets, but Boeing leans more on consistent third-party market data while RTX applies more forward-looking financial modeling.",

Pension plan assets also include investments in other assets that are carried at fair value. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to value real estate investments and these additional investments, including the general classification pursuant to the fair value hierarchy.\n\nReal Estate - Real estate investments are valued by independent third party appraisers. The appraisals comply with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, which include, among other things, the income, cost, and sales comparison approaches to estimating property value. Therefore, these investments are classified in Level 3.\n\nPrivate equity and hedge fund limited partnerships - Private equity and hedge fund limited partnerships are carried at fair value which is estimated using the NAV per unit as reported by the administrator of the underlying investment fund as a practical expedient to fair value. Therefore, these investments have been excluded from the fair value table below.\n\nPension plan assets with changes in fair value measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

Investments in securities traded on exchanges, including listed futures  and  options,  are  valued  at  the  last  reported  sale  prices  on  the  last  business  day  of  the  year  or,  if  not  available,  the  last reported  bid  prices.  Fixed  income  securities  are  primarily  measured  using  a  market  approach  pricing  methodology,  where observable prices are obtained by market transactions involving identical or comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. Mortgages have been valued on the basis of their future principal and interest payments discounted at prevailing interest rates for similar investments. Investment contracts are valued at fair value by discounting the related cash flows based on current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations. Real estate investments are valued on a quarterly basis using discounted cash flow models which consider long-term lease estimates, future rental receipts and estimated residual values. Valuation estimates are supplemented by third-party appraisals on an annual basis.\n\nPrivate equity limited partnerships are valued quarterly using discounted cash flows, earnings multiples and market multiples. Valuation adjustments reflect changes in operating results, financial condition, or prospects of the applicable portfolio company. Over-the-counter securities and government obligations are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask prices  on  the  last  business  day  of  the  year  from  published  sources  or,  if  not  available,  from  other  sources  considered  reliable, generally broker quotes. Temporary cash investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.\n\nThe fair market value of assets related to our PRB benefits was $389 million and $381 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\n\nIn  2017,  the  United  Kingdom's  Financial  Conduct Authority  (FCA)  announced  that  after  2021  it  would  no  longer  compel banks  to  submit  the  rates  required  to  calculate  the  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate  (LIBOR),  which  have  been  widely  used  as reference rates for various securities and financial contracts, including loans, debt and derivatives. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021. Subsequently in March 2021, the FCA announced some USD LIBOR tenors (overnight, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and 12 month) will continue to be published until June 30, 2023. Regulators in the U.S. and other jurisdictions have been working to replace these rates with alternative reference interest rates that are supported by transactions in liquid and observable markets, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for USD LIBOR. Currently, our credit facility and certain of our derivative instruments reference LIBOR-based rates. Our credit facility contains  provisions  specifying  alternative  interest  rate  calculations  to  be  employed  when  LIBOR  ceases  to  be  available  as  a benchmark and we have adhered to the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, which will govern our derivatives upon the final cessation of USD LIBOR. ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on  Financial  Reporting ,  as  amended,  helps  limit  the  accounting  impact  from  contract  modifications,  including  hedging relationships, due to the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates that are completed by December 31, 2022. We do not expect a significant impact to our operating results, financial position or cash flows from the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference interest rates, but we will continue to monitor the impact of this transition until it is completed.\n\nBusiness Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\n\nIn  October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires entities to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities  acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) .  The update will generally result in an entity recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at amounts consistent with those recorded by the acquiree immediately before the acquisition date rather than at fair value. The new standard is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2022. The adoption of the new standard did not have an impact to our operating results, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities About Government Assistance\n\nIn  November  2021,  the  FASB  issued ASU  2021-10, Government Assistance  (Topic  832) , Disclosures  by  Business  Entities About Government Assistance, which requires entities to provide disclosures on material government assistance transactions for annual reporting periods. The disclosures include information around the nature of the assistance, the related accounting policies used  to  account  for  government  assistance,  the  effect  of  government  assistance  on  the  entity's  financial  statements,  and  any significant terms and conditions of the agreements, including commitments and contingencies. The new standard is effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2022 and only impacts annual financial statement footnote disclosures. Therefore, the adoption will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 2 - Pending Acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.\n\nOn December 20, 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (Aerojet Rocketdyne) for $51.00 per share, which is net of a $5.00 per share special cash dividend Aerojet Rocketdyne paid to its stockholders on March 24, 2021. At the time of announcement, this represented a post-dividend equity value of approximately $4.6 billion, on a fully diluted as-converted  basis,  and  a  transaction  value  of  approximately  $4.4  billion  after  the  assumption  of  Aerojet  Rocketdyne's  thenprojected net cash. If the transaction is completed, we expect to finance the acquisition primarily through new debt issuances. The transaction was approved by Aerojet Rocketdyne's stockholders on March 9, 2021. As part of the regulatory review process of the transaction,  on  September  24,  2021,  we  and Aerojet  Rocketdyne  each  certified  substantial  compliance  with  the  Federal  Trade Commission's (FTC) requests for additional information, known as a 'second request.' On January 11, 2022, the parties provided an updated notice of their intended closing date under their timing agreement with the FTC, whereby the parties agreed that they would not close the transaction before January 27, 2022, to enable the parties to discuss the scope and nature of the merchant supply and firewall commitments previously offered to the FTC by Lockheed Martin. We have been advised by the FTC that its concerns regarding the transaction cannot be addressed adequately by the terms of a consent order. We believe it is highly likely that the FTC will vote to sue to block the transaction and expect they will make a decision before January 27, 2022. If the FTC sues to block the transaction, we could elect to defend the lawsuit within 30 days or terminate the merger agreement. If the FTC does not file a lawsuit to block the transaction before January 27, 2022, the parties could proceed to close the transaction, but there is no assurance that the FTC would not file a lawsuit",

      "question": "How does the use of discounted cash flow models in valuing fixed income investments by MMM's pension plans compare to HON's reliance on pricing models for similar asset classes, and what specific observable and unobservable inputs do each company highlight in their valuation approaches?",
      "answer": "MMM values its fixed income investments using either closing prices on active markets or a discounted cash flow approach that incorporates observable inputs like current yields of similar instruments, as well as unobservable inputs such as credit and liquidity risks. HON, on the other hand, values its corporate bonds, mortgage/asset-backed securities, and government securities using pricing models that include observable inputs (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, and credit spreads) and also unobservable inputs like credit and liquidity risks. Both companies use these models to manage fair value measurement in their pension plans, but MMM explicitly mentions the use of discounted cash flow as a method, while HON emphasizes pricing models that use a broader set of market-derived and risk-adjusted inputs.",

The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities then divided by the number of units outstanding and is determined by the investment manager or custodian of the fund. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the fair value of plan assets.\n\nEquities consist primarily of mandates in public equity securities managed to various public equity indices. Publicly traded equities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.\n\nFixed Income investments include domestic and foreign government, and corporate debt securities. The debt securities are valued at the closing price reported if traded on an active market or at yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnership interests in a variety of funds which are valued at NAV as described above. Real estate consists of property funds and REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts). REITS are valued at NAV with published prices provided by the custodians.\n\nAbsolute return consists primarily of private partnership interests in hedge funds, insurance contracts and derivative instruments. Partnerships and hedge funds are valued at NAV as described above. Insurance consists of insurance contracts, which are valued using cash surrender values which is the amount the plan would receive if the contract was cashed out at year end. Derivative instruments consist of various swaps and bond futures that are used to help manage risks and are valued by the custodian using closing market swap curves and market derived input\n\nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include the net of interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased and interest payable. At December 31, 2024 the net payable includes a payable of $88 million to the Canadian Solventum pension.\n\nThe balances of and changes in the fair values of the international pension plans' level 3 assets consist primarily of insurance contracts under the absolute return asset class. In 2024 the aggregate of net purchases and net unrealized gains and losses decreased this balance by $43 million and the change in currency exchange rates decreased this balance by $37 million for a net decrease of $80 million. In 2023 the aggregate net purchases and net unrealized gains increased this balance by $138 million and the change in currency exchange rates increased the balance by $6 million for a net increase to this balance of $144 million.",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $990 million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024. There are no expected required contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2025.\n\nThe following table presents estimated future benefit payments as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\n\n",

A s of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company's non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $195 million and $124 million, respectively . In both the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is related to outstanding equity and fixed income futures contracts.\n\nCommon stocks, preferred stocks, broad index exposures with ETFs, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgage/asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows, and as such, include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity , debt, real estate and hedge funds, and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. V aluation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. The insurance buy-in contracts represent policies held by the Honeywell UK Pension Scheme, whereby the cost of providing pension benefits to plan participants is funded by the policies. The cash flows from the policies are intended to match the pension benefits. The fair value of these policies is based on an estimate of the policies' exit price.\n\nThe Company's funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company was not required to make contributions to the U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made. The Company is not required to make any contributions to the U.S. pension plans in 2025. In 2024, contributions of $15 million were made to the non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2025, the Company expects to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $6 million to the nonU.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Contributions for both the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets.\n\n108 Honeywell International Inc.",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $990 million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024. There are no expected required contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2025.\n\nThe following table presents estimated future benefit payments as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\n\n",

For equity securities without readily determinable fair values that qualify for the NAV  practical ex pedient, we have elected to apply the NAV practical expedient to estimate fair value. We apply the measurement alternative for all other equity securities without readily determinable fair values, where adjustments to cost are made for observable price changes and any impairments.

      "question": "How does LMT's use of a discounted cash flow approach in valuing Level 3 fixed income investments compare to HON's application of the same method in testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, particularly in terms of the sensitivity to projected cash flows and discount rates?",
      "answer": "LMT applies the discounted cash flow approach to certain Level 3 fixed income investments, relying on projected annuity payments and a discount rate applied to those payments. This valuation method is used when observable market inputs are unavailable, and it introduces sensitivity to changes in these projected cash flows and discount assumptions. Similarly, HON utilizes a discounted cash flow approach for testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, incorporating strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. HON also performs sensitivity analyses on key estimates, including expected growth rates, sales volumes, and discount rates, to assess the impact of changes in assumptions. Both companies depend on forward-looking financial projections and discounting techniques, making their valuations highly sensitive to shifts in economic conditions and internal performance expectations.",

      "answer": "GE utilizes the discounted cash flow (DCF) approach as part of its goodwill impairment testing, relying on cash flow forecasts adjusted for terminal value assumptions or a market approach, with sensitivity analyses performed on key estimates like future cash flows. This directly affects the potential impairment of goodwill if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value derived from these projections. In contrast, BA applies the DCF methodology to value certain fixed income investments, where significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments. These valuations are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. While both companies use DCF, GE\u2019s application is forward-looking and tied to internal operating plans and impairment risk, whereas BA\u2019s use is externally oriented, dependent on market-based discount rates and fixed income market dynamics.",

          "chunk_text": "REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG -TERM SERVICES AG REEMENTS. We enter into long-term services agreements with our customers, predominantly within the CES segment, that require us to maintain the customers' assets over the contract terms, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. Contract modifications that extend or revise contracts are not uncommon. We recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. This requires us to make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the current contract term as well as the costs to perform required maintenance services.\n\nOur rights to consideration for these arrangements are generally based on the utilization of the asset (e.g., per hour of usage) and contractual payment terms are based on either periodic billing schedules or upon the occurrence of a maintenance event, such as an overhaul. A s a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenue of a contract is estimating how customers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. The estimate of utilization, which can change over the contract life, impacts both the amount of customer payments we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract costs. Customers' asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhauls and other service events over the life of the contract. We generally use a combination of both historical utilization trends as well as forward-looking information such as market conditions and potential asset retirements in developing our revenue estimates.\n\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul events, including the frequency of maintenance events and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the maintenance. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.\n\nWe routinely review estimates and revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. Changes in estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis with an adjustment to revenue in the current period. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. Contract modifications that change the rights and obligations, as well as the nature, timing and extent of future cash flows, are evaluated for potential price concessions, contract asset impairments and significant financing to determine if adjustments of earnings are required before effectively accounting for a modified contract as a new contract.\n\nWe regularly assess expected billings adjustments and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and fleet management strategies through close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions may affect a long-term services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings.\n\nOn December 31, 2024, our long-term service agreements net liability balance of $6.6 billion represents approximately 4.1% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $162 billion. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 18.4% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. Revisions to our estimates of future billings or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage point would increase or decrease the long-term service agreements balance by $0.4 billion. Billings collected on these contracts were $8.6 billion and $8.1 billion during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Notes 1 and 8 for further information.\n\nNONRECURRING ENGINEERING  COSTS. We incur contract fulfillment costs for engineering and development of products directly related to existing or anticipated contracts with customers, primarily in our Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies segment. Contract fulfillment costs are capitalized to the extent recoverable from the customer contract, and subsequently amortized as the products are delivered to the customer. We periodically assess the recoverability of capitalized contract fulfillment costs, which requires significant judgement. Specifically, we estimate program volumes, contract revenue based on negotiated prices, and product costs based on input costs, inflation and productivity. See Note 8 for further information.\n\nIMPAIRMENT OF G OODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIED INTANG IBLE ASSETS . Goodwill is subject to annual, or more frequent, if necessary, impairment testing. In the impairment test, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions, or a market approach, when available and appropriate, utilizing market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, or both. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, and changes to those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analyses on key estimates and assumptions. Once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired. In the fourth quarter of each y ear, we perform our annual impairment test. See Note 7 for further information.\n\nWe review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. To determine fair value, we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate. See Notes 1 and 7 for further information.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 17",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $990 million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024. There are no expected required contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2025.\n\nThe following table presents estimated future benefit payments as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\n\n",

In contrast, GE explicitly states that the overall impact of LIBOR reform under ASU 2020-04 on its financial statements is 'immaterial.' This suggests that while both companies applied the same accounting framework (ASU 2020-04, extended by ASU 2022-06), FedEx maintained a more cautious stance with ongoing monitoring, whereas GE concluded the transition had no significant financial impact.",

However, RTX's 2023 disclosures indicate that rising material and labor costs in a high-inflation environment can lead to losses on fixed-price contracts due to cost overruns. Similarly, BA's BDS and BGS defense businesses derived 58% and 65% of their 2023 revenues from fixed-price contracts, and BA specifically reported $1,585 million in additional losses on five major fixed-price development programs (Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, and VC-25B Presidential Aircraft) due to production disruptions, supplier issues, and technical challenges.

      "answer": "FDX values its U.S. Government Securities using bid evaluation pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, which aligns with the use of observable market data. Similarly, BA uses matrix pricing for fixed income securities, relying on a market approach that considers a security's relationship to other securities with quoted prices.

Level 1 investments include cash, cash equivalents, and foreign currency valued using exchange rates. Level 2 investments include short-term investment funds which are collective funds priced at a constant value by the administrator of the funds.\n- Domestic, international, and global equities . Level 1 investments are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded.\n- Fixed income . We determine the fair value of Level 2 corporate bonds, U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, and other fixed-income securities by using bid evaluation pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.\n- Alternative Investments . The valuation of Level 3 investments requires significant judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity, and the long-term nature of such assets. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate, hedge funds, and other private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. These estimates incorporate factors such as contributions and distributions, market transactions, market comparables, and performance multiples.\n\nThe fair values of investments by level and asset category and the weighted-average asset allocations for our U.S. Pension Plans and our most significant international pension plans at the measurement date are presented in the following table (in millions):\n\n",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .\n\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value.\n\n- U.S. and Foreign Government Securities : U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities and municipal securities. Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Corporate Debt Instruments : Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Common Stock : Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date.\n- Collective Investment Funds : Collective investment funds consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index. They are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective collective investment funds. The underlying assets are valued based on the net asset value ('NAV'), which is provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCash Flows: Altria makes contributions to the pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax deductible and pays benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. Currently, Altria anticipates making employer contributions to its pension and postretirement plans of up to approximately $30 million for each in 2022. However, the foregoing estimates of 2022 contributions to the pension and postretirement plans are subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, changes in interest rates, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return for each respective plan.\n\nEstimated future benefit payments at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How do MMM's pension plan asset valuations and HON's goodwill impairment testing both reflect sensitivity to market conditions, given their reliance on fair value estimation methods that involve significant judgment?",
      "answer": "MMM's pension plan assets rely on fair value estimation methods that involve considerable judgment, particularly when market data interpretation or valuation methodologies differ, which could materially affect the estimated fair value of its financial instruments (MET_10k_2023.pdf:page_264:chunk_3). MMM's U.S. pension plans use long-duration cash bonds and derivatives to offset interest rate sensitivity, with approximately 83% of postretirement plan assets held in a 401(h) account invested under the same objectives as the primary U.S. pension plan (MMM_10k_2023.pdf:page_71:chunk_3). Similarly, HON depends on fair value estimation for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing, utilizing discounted cash flow models that incorporate strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These estimates are sensitive to market conditions such as interest rate fluctuations and economic volatility, which could materially impact HON\u2019s financial condition or operating performance (HON_10k_2023.pdf:page_47:chunk_1). Both companies face risks tied to market sensitivity in their fair value estimation processes, highlighting the importance of judgment in financial reporting.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MMM \u2192 Valuation Methods: MMM discloses its pension plan investment strategy and references the fair value measurement of certain assets, noting that valuation methods involve judgment and could result in different fair value estimates depending on methodologies or assumptions.",
        "Hop 2: Valuation Methods \u2192 Fair Value Estimation: MET_10k_2023 highlights that fair value estimation is sensitive to market conditions, with considerable judgment required in interpreting market data, and different assumptions can materially affect estimated fair value amounts.",
        "Hop 3: Fair Value Estimation \u2190 HON: HON relies on fair value estimation for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing using discounted cash flow models, which are subject to market sensitivity and economic volatility, potentially impacting financial results."

      "answer": "GE holds $1,012 million in private equity funds as part of its insurance operations, which are measured at net asset value (NAV) per share as a practical expedient to estimated fair value. These funds are valued using NAV-based models that include unobservable inputs, as noted in the LMT document. Similarly, GD reports that its Level 3 assets include direct private equity investments measured using unobservable inputs, aligning with the valuation methodology described for private equity funds. This indicates that both GE and GD rely on complex, non-market-observable models to value private equity exposures, despite the differing structures of their investments (funds vs. direct holdings).",

      "answer": "FDX's Five-Year Credit Agreement expires in March 2029, while CAT maintains both a 3-Year and a 5-Year Credit Facility under Citibank, N.A., with the 5-Year Facility dated September 1, 2022, and amended on August 31, 2023. This suggests that both companies are actively managing their credit arrangements with Citibank, N.A., but FDX's timeline provides visibility and stability in funding through 2029, aligning with its capital-intensive investments like Network 2.0 and aircraft modernization. CAT's dual facility structure allows for more flexible financing across shorter and longer horizons, supporting its global operations and financial services subsidiaries.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .\n\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value.\n\n- U.S. and Foreign Government Securities : U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities and municipal securities. Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Corporate Debt Instruments : Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Common Stock : Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date.\n- Collective Investment Funds : Collective investment funds consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index. They are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective collective investment funds. The underlying assets are valued based on the net asset value ('NAV'), which is provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCash Flows: Altria makes contributions to the pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax deductible and pays benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. Currently, Altria anticipates making employer contributions to its pension and postretirement plans of up to approximately $30 million for each in 2022. However, the foregoing estimates of 2022 contributions to the pension and postretirement plans are subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, changes in interest rates, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return for each respective plan.\n\nEstimated future benefit payments at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

The disclosure below of asset categories is presented in aggregate for over 70 defined benefit plans in 25 countries; however, there is significant variation in asset allocation policy from country to country. Local regulations, local funding rules, and local financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

These limited partnership investments are generally not eligible for redemption and generally cannot be sold without approval of the general partner. Distribution from each fund will be received as the underlying investments of the funds are liquidated at the discretion of the general partner. These investments are generally considered illiquid and our ability to receive the most recent net asset value in a sale would be determined by external market factors.\n\nOur run-off insurance operations have approximately $700 million of assets held by states or other regulatory bodies in statutorily required deposit accounts, and approximately $29,800 million of assets held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts and reinsurance security trust agreements in place between either Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) or Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC) as the reinsuring entity and a number of ceding insurers. Assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contracts and trust agreements. Some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of ERA C or UFLIC which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.",

          "chunk_text": "INSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include providing insurance and reinsurance for life and health risks and providing certain annuity products. Primary product types include long-term care, structured settlement annuities, life and disability insurance contracts and investment contracts. Insurance contracts are contracts with significant mortality and/or morbidity risks, while investment contracts are contracts without such risks. Insurance revenue is comprised primarily of premiums and investment income. For traditional long-duration insurance contracts, we report premiums as revenue when due. Premiums received on non-traditional long-duration insurance contracts and investment contracts, including annuities without significant mortality risk, are not reported as revenue but rather as deposit liabilities. We recognize revenue for charges and assessments on these contracts, mostly for mortality, administration and surrender. Interest credited to policyholder accounts is charged to expense.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions. A s a run-off insurance operation consisting substantially all of reinsurance, contracts are grouped into cohorts by legal entity and product type, based on the date the reinsurance contract was consummated. Future policy benefit reserves are adjusted each period as a result of updating lifetime net premium ratios for differences between actual and expected experience with the retroactive effect of those variances recognized in current period earnings. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings.\n\nAs our insurance operations are in run-off, the locked-in discount rate is used for the computation of interest accretion on future policy benefit reserves recognized in earnings. However, cash flows used to estimate future policy benefit reserves are also discounted using an upper-medium grade (i.e., low credit risk) fixedincome instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristics of the liabilities and is updated each reporting period with changes recorded in A ccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). As a result, changes in the current discount rate at each reporting period are recognized as an adjustment to A OCI and not earnings each period, whereas, changes relating to cash flow assumptions are recognized in the Statement of Earnings (Loss).\n\nLiabilities for inv estment contracts equal the account value, that is, the amount that accrues to the benefit of the contract or policyholder including credited interest and assessments through the financial statement date. See Note 12 for further information.\n\nPOSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. We sponsor a number of pension and retiree health and life insurance benefit plans that we present in three categories, principal pension plans, other pension plans and principal retiree benefit plans. We use a December 31 measurement date for these plans. On our Statement of Financial Position, we measure our plan assets at fair value and the obligations at the present value of the estimated payments to plan participants. Participants earn benefits based on their service and pay. Those estimated future payment amounts are determined based on assumptions. Differences between our actual results and what we assumed are recorded in a separate component of equity each period. These differences are amortized into earnings over the remaining average future service of active employees or the expected life of inactive participants, as applicable, who participate in the plan. See Note 13 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability  in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROG RAMS. We evaluate supply chain finance programs to ensure where we use a third-party intermediary to settle our trade payables, their inv olv ement does not change the nature, existence, amount or timing of our trade payables and does not provide the Company with any direct economic benefit. If any  characteristics of the trade pay ables change or we receive a direct economic benefit, we reclassify the trade payables as borrowings.\n\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. The following sections describe the valuation methodologies we use to measure financial and non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value including certain assets within our pension plans and retiree benefit plans. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These inputs establish a fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and Level 3 Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.\n\n46 2024 FORM  10-K",

A s of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company's non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $195 million and $124 million, respectively . In both the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is related to outstanding equity and fixed income futures contracts.\n\nCommon stocks, preferred stocks, broad index exposures with ETFs, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgage/asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows, and as such, include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity , debt, real estate and hedge funds, and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. V aluation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. The insurance buy-in contracts represent policies held by the Honeywell UK Pension Scheme, whereby the cost of providing pension benefits to plan participants is funded by the policies. The cash flows from the policies are intended to match the pension benefits. The fair value of these policies is based on an estimate of the policies' exit price.\n\nThe Company's funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company was not required to make contributions to the U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made. The Company is not required to make any contributions to the U.S. pension plans in 2025. In 2024, contributions of $15 million were made to the non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2025, the Company expects to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $6 million to the nonU.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Contributions for both the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets.\n\n108 Honeywell International Inc.",

One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability.\n\nFedEx is making progress with Network 2.0, as the company has implemented Network 2.0 optimization in more than 50 locations in the U.S. Contracted service providers will handle the pickup and delivery of packages in some locations while employee couriers will handle others.\n\nWe incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $582 million ($444 million, net of tax , or $1.77 per diluted share) in 2024 and $273 million ($209 million, net of tax , or $0.81 per diluted share) in 2023. The costs incurred in 2024 were primarily related to professional fees and severance, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. The costs incurred in 2023 were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in Russia, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express. We did not incur costs associated with our business optimization activities in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe related to the network integration of TNT Express. The plan affected approximately 5,000 employees in Europe across operational teams and back-office functions and was completed during 2023. We incurred costs of $36 million ($27 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) in 2023 and $278 million ($214 million, net of tax , or $0.80 per diluted share) in 2022 associated with our business realignment activities. These costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements. Payments under this program totaled approximately $118 million in 2023 and approximately $225 million in 2022. The cumulative pre-tax cost of our business realignment activities was approximately $430 million. We did not incur any costs related to business realignment activities in 2024.\n\nIn June 2024, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe as part of its ongoing measures to reduce structural costs. The plan will impact between 1,700 and 2,000 employees in Europe across back-office and commercial functions. The execution of the plan is subject to a consultation process that is expected to occur over an 18-month period in accordance with local country processes and regulations. We expect the pre-tax cost of the severance benefits and legal and professional fees to be provided under and related to the plan to range from $250 million to $375 million in cash ex penditures. These charges are expected to be incurred through fiscal 2026 and will be classified as business optimization ex penses.\n\nUSE OF ESTIMATES . The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include self-insurance accruals, retirement plan obligations, long-term incentive accruals, tax  liabilities, loss contingencies, litigation claims, impairment assessments on long-lived assets (including goodwill) that rely on projections of future cash flows, and purchase price allocations.\n\n## NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\n\nNew accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly affect our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements. We believe the following new accounting guidance is relevant to the readers of our financial statements.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires a buyer in a supplier finance program (e.g., reverse factoring) to disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program's nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. The amendments do not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. We adopted this standard effective June 1, 2023 (fiscal 2024). The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or internal controls. See Note 1 for further discussion about our supplier finance program obligations.",

This ASU requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, licenses, patents, customer lists, non-compete agreements and franchise rights are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from 2 to 21 years. Capitalized software is generally amortized over 7 years. Finite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment as part of asset groups whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n## Assets Held for Sale\n\nWe classify long-lived assets or disposal groups as held for sale in the period when all of the following conditions have been met:\n\n- we have approved and committed to a plan to sell the assets or disposal group;\n- the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition;\n- an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the sale have been initiated;\n- the sale of the asset or disposal group is probable and expected to be completed within one year;\n- the asset or disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and\n- it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nWe initially measure a long-lived asset or disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell and recognize any loss in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. G ains are not recognized until the date of sale. We cease depreciation and amortization of a long-lived asset, or assets within a disposal group, upon their designation as held for sale and subsequently assess fair value less any costs to sell at each reporting date until the asset or disposal group is no longer classified as held for sale.\n\n## Supplier Finance Programs\n\nAs part of our working capital management, certain financial institutions offer a Supply Chain Finance (\"SCF\") program to certain of our suppliers. We agree to commercial terms with our suppliers, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. Suppliers issue invoices to us based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. If they participate in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, to sell to the financial institutions. Our suppliers' voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No guarantees are provided by us under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the SCF program.\n\nAmounts due to our suppliers that participate in the SCF program are included in Accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets.

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nWe maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources.\n\nOur main exposures to market risk relate to interest rates, foreign currency ex change rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fix ed-rate long-term debt and commercial paper, if issued. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $20.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and the outstanding principal amount of debt, including short-term and long-term debt, was $21.6 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.3 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2024.\n\nWe use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates.  We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to minimize fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Norwegian kroner and the Polish zloty. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate  changes  primarily  through  our  borrowing  activities.  For  fix ed  rate  borrowings,  we  may  use  variable  interest  rate  swaps,  effectively  converting  fix ed  rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to minimize certain economic exposures.\n\nThe classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are not highly effective, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps was $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $7.5 billion and $6.5 billion. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see 'Note 15 - Fair V alue Measurements' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter  into  foreign  currency  contracts  to  hedge  foreign  currency  ex posure  on  underlying  transactions,  we  believe  that  any  movement  on  our  foreign  currency contracts would be offset by movement on the underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.\n\nWe evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across many banks. We regularly monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nWe maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2024, investments in the trust totaled $1.8 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fix ed-income securities that are ex posed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2024.",

These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed.

      "question": "How does BA's use of discounted cash flow models for valuing fixed income investments compare to HON's application of the same technique in goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing, particularly in terms of the inputs and assumptions each company emphasizes?",
      "answer": "BA uses the discounted cash flow (DCF) approach to value certain fixed income investments, relying on inputs such as projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments. This method is employed when observable market data is unavailable, and the valuation is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In contrast, HON applies the DCF approach to estimate the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during impairment testing, incorporating strategic and annual operating plans, terminal value assumptions, and sensitivity analyses. While BA\u2019s DCF usage focuses on income-based projections for fixed-income instruments, HON\u2019s application centers on enterprise-level financial forecasts and forward-looking assumptions about business performance and market conditions.",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient.

          "chunk_text": "Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets -The Company's business combinations typically result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets. The Company generally engages an independent third-party valuation specialist for assistance in the allocation of the purchase price and determination of the fair value  of  goodwill  and  intangible  assets,  which  involves  the  use  of  accounting  estimates  and  assumptions  based  on  information  available  at  or  near  the acquisition date. The Company believes the accounting estimates and assumptions are reasonable based on information available at the date of acquisition through  historical  experience  and  information  obtained  from  management  of  the  acquired  entity;  however,  there  is  inherent  uncertainty  in  the  accounting estimates as assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent, if necessary , impairment testing. In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, and changes to those  assumptions  could  materially  impact  our  financial  condition  or  operating  performance  if  actual  results  differ  from  such  accounting  estimates  and assumptions. T o address this uncertainty , we perform sensitivity analyses on key accounting estimates and assumptions. Once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired. A ny impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value.\n\nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets -The Company's business combinations typically result in the recognition of customer relationships, patents, and trademarks, in addition to other definite-liv ed intangible assets. The determination of fair value for definite-lived intangible assets, useful lives for amortization purposes and whether or not intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. The assumptions used in developing the accounting estimates  may  include  business  growth  rates,  sales  volume,  selling  prices  and  costs,  cash  flows,  and  the  discount  rate  selected.  Changes  to  those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a definite-lived intangible asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows:\n\n- Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings, or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;\n- Annual operating plans or strategic plan outlook that indicates an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;\n- Significant negative industry or economic trends; or\n- Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets.\n\nOnce it is determined that an impairment review is necessary , recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is then measured as the excess, if any, of the carry ing amount of the asset group over its fair value.\n\nThe fair value estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility . M anagement believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variances from assumptions could materially affect the valuations.\n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans -We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. A nnual pension (income) expense is comprised of service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets, prior service amortization (Pension ongoing (income) expense), and a potential mark-to-market adjustment (M TM  A djustment).\n\nThe key assumptions used in developing our net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following:\n\n",

Similarly, GE also uses NAV as a practical expedient for valuing its real estate investments within pension plans, relying on the fair value of the underlying assets of the funds.

In contrast, EMR discloses that its private equity fund investments cannot be redeemed directly and will instead be liquidated over approximately 10 years through distributions.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

International equities are comprised of companies domiciled in developed nations outside the U.S. Emerging market equities are comprised of companies domiciled in portions of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Corporate bonds represent inv estment-grade debt of issuers primarily from the U.S. Gov ernment bonds include inv estment-grade instruments issued by federal, state and local gov ernments, primarily in the U.S. Other includes cash, interests in mixed asset funds inv esting in commodities, natural resources, agriculture, real estate and infrastructure funds, life insurance contracts (U.S.), and shares in certain general inv estment funds of financial institutions or insurance arrangements (non-U.S.) that typically ensure no market losses or prov ide for a small minimum return guarantee.\n\n## Fair Value Hierarchy Categories\n\nValuations of Lev el 1 assets for all classes are based on quoted closing market prices from the principal exchanges where the indiv idual securities are traded. Cash is v alued at cost, which approximates fair v alue. Debt securities categorized as Lev el 2 assets are generally v alued based on independent broker/dealer bids or by comparison to other debt securities hav ing similar durations, yields and credit ratings. Valuation techniques and inputs for these assets include discounted cash flow analysis, earnings multiple approaches, recent transactions, transfer restrictions, prev ailing discount rates, volatilities, credit ratings and other factors. In the Other class, interests in mixed asset funds are Lev el 2, and U.S. life insurance contracts and non-U.S. general fund inv estments and insurance arrangements are Lev el 3. Inv estments measured at NAV are primarily nonexchange-traded commingled or collectiv e funds where the underlying securities hav e observ able prices av ailable from activ e markets and typically prov ide liquidity daily or within a few days. The NAV category also includes fund inv estments in priv ate equities, real estate and infrastructure where the fair v alue of the underlying assets is determined by the inv estment manager. Total unfunded commitments for the priv ate equity funds were approximately $90 at September 30, 2024. These inv estments cannot be redeemed, but instead the funds will make distributions through liquidation of the underlying assets, which is expected to occur over approximately the next 10 years. The real estate and infrastructure funds typically offer quarterly redemption.\n\n## Postretirement Plans\n\nThe Company also sponsors unfunded postretirement benefit plans (primarily health care) for certain U.S. retirees and their dependents. The Company's principal U.S. postretirement plan has been frozen to new employees since 1993. The postretirement benefit liability for all plans was $71 and $72 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely, and included deferred actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensiv e income of $68 and $95, respectiv ely. Serv ice and interest costs are negligible and more than offset by the amortization of deferred actuarial gains, which resulted in net postretirement income of $18 for 2024, $19 for 2023 and $12 for 2022.

FedEx (FDX) stated that while there has been no material effect on its financial condition or operations as of May 31, 2024, it continues to monitor its contracts and transactions for potential application of these ASUs. ASU 2022-06 deferred the sunset date of ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, to address the extended phase-out of LIBOR tenors beyond the original deadline. Caterpillar (CAT) is also subject to ASU 2022-06, as listed under its adopted accounting standards.

      "answer": "Citibank, N.A. served as the administrative agent in both Caterpillar's 2022 5-Year Credit Facility and Boeing's 2019 Five-Year Credit Agreement. In Caterpillar's case, Amendment No. 1 to the 5-Year Facility was dated August 31, 2023, indicating a modification within one year of the original agreement. For Boeing, Amendment No. 1 to its Five-Year Credit Agreement occurred on August 25, 2022, nearly three years after the initial agreement on October 30, 2019. Additionally, Boeing's syndication structure included JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as syndication agent and joint lead arranger alongside Citibank, N.A., while Caterpillar's syndication involved Citibank, N.A. and MUFG Bank, Ltd. in agent roles without a comparable dual lead arranger structure.",

Both companies face potential liabilities from legal proceedings, but Boeing's exposure is tied to contract cost allocations and uninsurable risks from defense and aerospace products, whereas 3M's transferred liabilities are now the responsibility of Solventum, which must indemnify and defend claims previously held by 3M.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.\n\nMany of our  employees  hav e  earned  benefits  under  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  Potential  pension  contributions  include  both  mandatory  amounts required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and discretionary contributions to improv e the plans' funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heav ily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these  plans  using  assumptions  with  respect  to  these  and  other  items.  Changes  to  those  assumptions  could  hav e  a  significant  effect  on  future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders' equity. For U.S. gov ernment contracts, we allocate pension costs to indiv idual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which can also affect contract profitability. We also prov ide  other  postretirement  benefits  to  certain  of  our  employees,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  cov erage  for  eligible  retirees  and  qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the lev el of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Pension Plans' on page 51 of this Form 10-K. Although under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) the timing of periodic pension and other postretirement benefit expense and plan contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans.\n\n## Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.\n\nWe  are  exposed  to  liabilities  that  are  unique  to  the  products  and  serv ices  we  prov ide.  We  maintain  insurance  for  certain  risks  and,  in  some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. gov ernment. The amount of our insurance cov erage may not cov er all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, space systems, spacecraft, satellites, missile systems, weapons, cybersecurity, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is av ailable outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. T he amount of insurance cov erage we maintain may be inadequate to cov er these or other claims or liabilities.\n\n## A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks.\n\nA significant  portion  of  our  customer  financing  portfolio,  which  is  comprised  of  financing  receiv ables  and  operating  lease  equipment,  is  concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio is also concentrated by v arying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 aircraft, and among customers that we believ e hav e less than inv estment-grade credit. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are  unable  to  redeploy  the  aircraft  on  reasonable  terms,  our  financial  position,  results  of  operations  and/or  cash  flows  could  be  materially  adv ersely affected.",

Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records as an accrual in its financial statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. Based on ex perience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether a loss previously determined to not be reasonably estimable and/or not probable is now able to be reasonably estimated or has become probable. Where appropriate, the Company makes additions to or adjustments of its reasonably estimated losses and/or accruals. As a result, the current accruals and/or estimates of loss and the estimates of the potential impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings, and claims pending against the Company will likely change over time.\n\nBecause litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, the Company may ultimately incur charges substantially in ex cess of presently recorded liabilities, including with respect to matters for which no accruals are currently recorded, because losses are not currently probable and reasonably estimable. Many of the matters described herein are at varying stages, seek an indeterminate amount of damages, or seek damages in amounts that the Company believes are not indicative of the ultimate losses that may be incurred. It is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years. As a matter progresses, the Company may receive information, through plaintiff demands, through discovery, in the form of reports of purported experts, or in the context of settlement or mediation discussions, that purport to quantify an amount of alleged damages, but with which the Company may not agree. Such information may or may not lead the Company to determine that it is able to make a reasonable estimate as to a probable loss or range of loss in connection with a matter. However, even when a loss or range of loss is not probable and reasonably estimable, developments in, or the ultimate resolution of, a matter could be material to the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, future adverse rulings or developments, or settlements in, one or more matters could result in future changes to determinations of probable and reasonably estimable losses in other matters.\n\nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings: The Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of the terms of its numerous policies, including their ex clusions, pertinent case law interpreting comparable policies, its ex perience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and records an amount it has concluded is recognizable and expects to receive in light of the loss recovery and/or gain contingency models under ASC 450, ASC 610-30, and related guidance. For those insured legal proceedings where the Company has recorded an accrued liability in its financial statements, the Company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable from the Company's insurance program. For those insured matters where the Company has not recorded an accrued liability because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, but where the Company has incurred an ex pense in defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable for the expense incurred.\n\nImpact of Solventum Spin-Off : On April 1, 2024, the Company completed the planned spin-off of its Health Care business as an independent company known as Solventum. Concurrent with the spin-off, the Company and Solventum entered into various agreements, including transition agreements and a separation and distribution agreement that, among other things, identified the assets to be transferred, the liabilities to be assumed, indemnification and defense obligations, and the contracts to be transferred to Solventum and 3M as part of the spin-off. In general, and except as noted below and as set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, certain liabilities related to Solventum or the assets that are transferred to Solventum in connection with the spin-off will be retained by or transferred to Solventum. For example, potential liabilities associated with the matters previously described in prior filings under the Bair Hugger and Federal False Claims Act / Qui Tam Litigation sections of this Note 19 have been assumed by Solventum pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, and Solventum will indemnify and defend the Company in these actions.",

      "question": "How does the extension of ASU 2022-06's relief for reference rate reform impact FDX's exposure to LIBOR-linked hedging relationships, particularly in light of MMM's reported derivative activity under similar hedging frameworks?",
      "answer": "ASU 2022-06 extended the optional expedients and exceptions for reference rate reform to December 31, 2024, which allows companies like FDX to continue applying simplified accounting treatments for LIBOR-linked contracts and hedging relationships affected by the phaseout of LIBOR. FDX specifically notes that while there has been no material effect from reference rate reform as of May 31, 2024, it continues to monitor its contracts and transactions for potential application of these ASUs. Meanwhile, MMM's hedging relationships include interest rate contracts with reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income into income, such as a $9 million loss in 2023, indicating active exposure to interest rate-linked derivatives. This suggests that both companies are managing LIBOR-linked exposures under the temporary relief provided by ASU 2022-06, though MMM's reported derivative activity highlights the ongoing financial impact of such hedging relationships even under the extended guidance.",

New optional expedients allow derivative instruments impacted by changes in the interest rate used for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment to qualify for certain optional relief. The amendments in ASU 2022-06 extend the sunset date of the reference rate reform optional expedients and exceptions to December 31, 2024. | Effective for contract modifications made between March 12, 2020 and December 31, 2024. | The guidance has reduced the operational and financial impacts of contract modifications that replace a reference rate, such as London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR'), affected by reference rate reform.

      "answer": "GE measures its $939 million of limited partnership investments in real estate funds at net asset value (NAV) per share as a practical expedient to estimated fair value, which aligns with BA's approach of using NAV for its limited partnership investments in private equity and real estate. However, GE explicitly excludes these NAV-measured investments from the fair value hierarchy, while BA describes these as part of its broader alternative investments strategy without specifying their exact valuation classification. Additionally, BA discloses $3.3 billion in unfunded commitments to such partnerships, indicating longer-term strategic commitments compared to GE's more general disclosure.",

      "answer": "FDX's Five-Year Credit Agreement, set to expire in March 2029, is a key source of liquidity for its operations, including the $1.3 billion allocated for aircraft deliveries and progress payments at Federal Express. Given that Boeing also relies on JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a syndication agent in its credit agreements, any market tightening or renegotiation challenges around that time could simultaneously affect both companies\u2019 access to capital. If FDX needs to refinance its aircraft-related obligations near the 2029 expiration, it may face similar financing conditions as Boeing, which also depends on a shared syndication partner for its own credit facilities, potentially influencing both companies' capital structures and funding strategies.",

      "answer": "GE adopted ASU 2022-04 on January 1, 2023, and began applying the annual roll-forward disclosure requirement prospectively starting January 1, 2024 (GE_10k_2024.pdf:page_47). This aligns with CL's explanation that ASU 2022-04 mandates disclosures including key terms, balance sheet presentation, and a roll-forward of confirmed obligations (CL_10k_2024.pdf:page_57). CAT, in its 2024 10-K (CAT_10k_2024.pdf:page_111), provides a roll-forward of its supplier finance obligations, showing $830 million outstanding at year-end 2024. The adoption of ASU 2022-04 enhances comparability between CAT and GE by standardizing how supplier finance obligations are disclosed, particularly with the new roll-forward requirement that GE implemented in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, primarily investment securities and derivatives, fair v alue is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability  in an orderly  transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. See Note 21 for further information.\n\nDebt Securities. When available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of debt securities which are included in Level 1. For our remaining debt securities, we obtain pricing information from an independent pricing vendor. The inputs and assumptions to the pricing vendor's models are derived from market observable sources including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other marketrelated data. These investments are included in Level 2. Our pricing vendors may also provide us with valuations that are based on significant unobservable inputs, and in those circumstances, we classify the investment securities in Level 3.\n\nAnnually, we conduct reviews of our primary pricing vendor to validate that the inputs used in that vendor's pricing process are deemed to be market observable as defined in the standard. We believe that the prices received from our pricing vendor are representative of prices that would be received to sell the assets at the measurement date (exit prices) and are classified appropriately in the hierarchy. We use non-binding broker quotes and other third-party pricing services as our primary basis for valuation when there is limited, or no, relevant market activity for a specific instrument or for other instruments that share similar characteristics. Debt securities priced in this manner are included in Level 3.\n\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values . These publicly traded equity securities are valued using quoted prices and are included in Level 1.\n\nDerivatives. The majority of our derivatives are valued using internal models. The models maximize the use of market observable inputs including interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 2 primarily represent interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency and commodity forward and option contracts.\n\nInvestments in private equity, real estate and collective funds held within our pension plans or run-off insurance operations . M ost inv estments are generally valued using the net asset value (NA V ) per share as a practical expedient for fair value provided certain criteria are met. The NA V s are determined based on the fair v alues of the underly ing inv estments in the funds. Inv estments that are measured at fair value using the NA V  practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair v alue hierarchy . Inv estments classified within Lev el 3 primarily  relate to real estate and priv ate equities which are v alued using unobserv able inputs, primarily by discounting expected future cash flows, using comparative market multiples, third-party pricing sources, or a combination of these approaches as appropriate. See Notes 3 and 13 for further information.\n\nNONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets may include loans and longliv ed assets reduced to fair value upon classification as held for sale, impaired loans based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, impaired equity securities without readily determinable fair value, equity method investments and long-lived assets and remeasured retained investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in the deconsolidation of that subsidiary and retention of a noncontrolling stake in the entity. Assets written down to fair value when impaired and retained investments are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.\n\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair value and Associated companies. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value and associated companies are valued using market observable data such as transaction prices when available. When market observable data is unavailable, investments are valued using either a discounted cash flow model, comparative market multiples, third-party pricing sources or a combination of these approaches as appropriate. These investments are generally included in Level 3.\n\nLong-lived Assets . Fair v alues of long-liv ed assets are primarily  deriv ed internally  and are based on observed sales transactions for similar assets or discounted cash flow estimates. In other instances for which we do not have comparable observed sales transaction data, collateral values are developed internally and corroborated by external appraisal information. A djustments to third-party valuations may be performed in circumstances where market comparables are not specific to the attributes of the specific collateral or appraisal information may not be reflective of current market conditions due to the passage of time and the occurrence of market events since receipt of the information.\n\nADOPTIONS OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50) Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations . This guidance requires disclosures for supply chain finance programs using a retrospective approach, except for the annual roll-forward which is applicable prospectively in the period beginning January 1, 2024. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn 2024, we adopted ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , on a retrospective basis. The amendments are intended to increase reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.

This ASU requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

      "answer": "GE faces cost overruns on large-scale energy projects, particularly in its Power and Renewable Energy divisions, which can lead to contractual penalties, liquidated damages, and joint liability in consortium arrangements. For example, operational failures or schedule delays on offshore wind turbine projects like the Haliade-X can result in significant unanticipated expenses. Similarly, LMT faces financial exposure from fixed-price contracts, such as a classified fixed-price incentive fee contract at its Aeronautics segment, where cumulative losses have reached approximately $270 million as of December 31, 2023. RTX's 2023 filing highlights that fixed-price contracts are particularly risky in the face of cost overruns, as companies cannot easily offset increased material, component, and labor prices. Both GE and LMT are exposed to financial strain due to the inflexibility of these contracts when unexpected cost increases occur.",

      "question": "How do Boeing's losses from cost overruns on fixed-price defense contracts compare to General Dynamics' risk management approach under similar macroeconomic pressures, including inflation-driven cost increases highlighted in RTX's filing?",
      "answer": "Boeing's fixed-price contracts, particularly in its BDS segment, led to $1,585 million in additional losses in 2023 across major programs like KC-46A Tanker and VC-25B Presidential Aircraft due to cost overruns driven by production disruptions, technical challenges, and supplier instability. RTX's 2023 filing highlights that inflationary pressures have increased material and labor costs across the defense industry, which can lead to losses on fixed-price contracts when cost overruns occur\u2014directly linking macroeconomic trends to Boeing's issues. In contrast, General Dynamics structures its contracts across fixed-price, cost-reimbursement, and time-and-materials models, with production contracts primarily fixed-price but acknowledging the higher risk these pose. GD strategically balances this risk by using lower-risk cost-reimbursement contracts for R&D and service work, suggesting a more diversified contract risk management strategy compared to Boeing's heavier reliance on fixed-price contracts in a high-pressure economic environment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BA \u2192 Cost Overruns: Boeing reported $1,585 million in additional losses on five major fixed-price defense programs in 2023 due to cost overruns.",
        "Hop 2: Cost Overruns \u2192 Fixed-Price Contracts: RTX\u2019s filing explicitly links inflationary pressures to increased material, component, and labor costs, which heighten the risk of losses on fixed-price contracts when cost overruns occur.",
        "Hop 3: Fixed-Price Contracts \u2190 GD: General Dynamics uses a mix of fixed-price, cost-reimbursement, and time-and-materials contracts, with fixed-price being the primary type for production work, but acknowledges the higher risk and mitigates it by using lower-risk contract types for R&D and services."

      "answer": "General Dynamics excludes state and local income taxes allocable to U.S. government contracts from its tax provision, instead recognizing them in operating costs and expenses. This treatment is governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which dictates how costs are allocated and allowed on government contracts. Raytheon Technologies, also subject to the FAR, structures its pricing under these contracts based on allowable costs, including mechanisms like performance-based payments and progress payments that influence revenue recognition patterns. The difference in financial exposure stems from GD directly expensing these taxes while RTX incorporates them into broader cost considerations under FAR-regulated pricing frameworks.",

We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.\n\n## REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment.  Such  advances  are  not  considered  a  significant  financing  component  because  they  are  used  to  meet  working  capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress, as sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of performing services under the contract is incurred on an other-than-straight-line basis. For some of our long-term aftermarket contracts, we receive payment prior to delivery of products and services, resulting in a contract liability balance, while for others, we deliver products or services in advance of payment, resulting in a contract asset balance.\n\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services that are not distinct are accounted for as part of the existing contract either on a cumulative catch-up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification.\n\nLoss provisions on contracts are recognized to the extent that estimated contract costs exceed the estimated consideration from the products or services contemplated under the contractual arrangement. For new commitments, we generally record loss provisions at contract signing except for certain contracts under which losses are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates us to perform. For existing commitments, anticipated losses on contractual arrangements are recognized in the period in which losses become evident. In estimating losses, products contemplated under contractual arrangements include firm quantities of product sold under contract and, in the commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, future highly probable sales of replacement parts required by regulation that are expected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment. In our commercial engine  and  wheels  and  brakes  businesses,  when  the  OEM  product  is  sold  for  a  loss,  but  the  combined  OEM  and  aftermarket arrangement for each individual sales campaign is profitable, we record OEM product losses at the time of product delivery.\n\nWe review our Estimate at Completion (EACs) on significant contracts on a periodic basis and for others, no less than annually or when  a  change  in  circumstances  warrant  a  modification  to  a  previous  estimate.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  work  required  to  be performed on many of the Company's performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks  and  opportunities  relate  to  management's  judgment  about  the  ability  and  cost  to  achieve  the  schedule,  consideration  of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or  aircraft  landings,  and  related  variable  consideration.  Management's  judgment  related  to  these  considerations  has  become increasingly more significant given the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity  and  scope  of  the  work  to  be  performed,  the  availability  and  cost  of  materials,  the  length  of  time  to  complete  the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives  of  components,  among  others.  Cost  estimates  may  also  include  the  estimated  cost  of  satisfying  our  industrial  cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts primarily within our RIS and RMD",

          "chunk_text": "INSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include providing insurance and reinsurance for life and health risks and providing certain annuity products. Primary product types include long-term care, structured settlement annuities, life and disability insurance contracts and investment contracts. Insurance contracts are contracts with significant mortality and/or morbidity risks, while investment contracts are contracts without such risks. Insurance revenue is comprised primarily of premiums and investment income. For traditional long-duration insurance contracts, we report premiums as revenue when due. Premiums received on non-traditional long-duration insurance contracts and investment contracts, including annuities without significant mortality risk, are not reported as revenue but rather as deposit liabilities. We recognize revenue for charges and assessments on these contracts, mostly for mortality, administration and surrender. Interest credited to policyholder accounts is charged to expense.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions. A s a run-off insurance operation consisting substantially all of reinsurance, contracts are grouped into cohorts by legal entity and product type, based on the date the reinsurance contract was consummated. Future policy benefit reserves are adjusted each period as a result of updating lifetime net premium ratios for differences between actual and expected experience with the retroactive effect of those variances recognized in current period earnings. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings.\n\nAs our insurance operations are in run-off, the locked-in discount rate is used for the computation of interest accretion on future policy benefit reserves recognized in earnings. However, cash flows used to estimate future policy benefit reserves are also discounted using an upper-medium grade (i.e., low credit risk) fixedincome instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristics of the liabilities and is updated each reporting period with changes recorded in A ccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). As a result, changes in the current discount rate at each reporting period are recognized as an adjustment to A OCI and not earnings each period, whereas, changes relating to cash flow assumptions are recognized in the Statement of Earnings (Loss).\n\nLiabilities for inv estment contracts equal the account value, that is, the amount that accrues to the benefit of the contract or policyholder including credited interest and assessments through the financial statement date. See Note 12 for further information.\n\nPOSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. We sponsor a number of pension and retiree health and life insurance benefit plans that we present in three categories, principal pension plans, other pension plans and principal retiree benefit plans. We use a December 31 measurement date for these plans. On our Statement of Financial Position, we measure our plan assets at fair value and the obligations at the present value of the estimated payments to plan participants. Participants earn benefits based on their service and pay. Those estimated future payment amounts are determined based on assumptions. Differences between our actual results and what we assumed are recorded in a separate component of equity each period. These differences are amortized into earnings over the remaining average future service of active employees or the expected life of inactive participants, as applicable, who participate in the plan. See Note 13 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability  in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROG RAMS. We evaluate supply chain finance programs to ensure where we use a third-party intermediary to settle our trade payables, their inv olv ement does not change the nature, existence, amount or timing of our trade payables and does not provide the Company with any direct economic benefit. If any  characteristics of the trade pay ables change or we receive a direct economic benefit, we reclassify the trade payables as borrowings.\n\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. The following sections describe the valuation methodologies we use to measure financial and non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value including certain assets within our pension plans and retiree benefit plans. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These inputs establish a fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and Level 3 Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.\n\n46 2024 FORM  10-K",

      "answer": "CAT reported $55 million in assets measured at NAV as part of its other postretirement benefit assets in 2023, which includes categories like U.S. corporate bonds ($30 million) and cash/short-term instruments ($18 million). NAV is used as a practical expedient for valuing private equity funds, among other alternative investments, as disclosed by UPS, indicating that NAV reflects the most recent partnership audited financial reports adjusted for investment activity. LMT, on the other hand, reported $4,863 million in private equity funds measured at NAV in 2024, significantly higher than CAT\u2019s NAV-based allocation, suggesting a much larger exposure to private equity investments. This comparison highlights differing approaches to retirement asset allocation and the scale of NAV-based investments between the two companies.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments.

      "answer": "LMT allocates between 5-15% of its assets to real estate funds as part of its alternative investments. These real estate funds are subject to valuation using NAV as a practical expedient, as seen in the referenced data where real estate funds were valued at $8 billion based on NAV. Similarly, UPS values its real estate investments using estimated NAV derived from audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers, with adjustments made for investment activity through year-end. Both companies rely on NAV for valuing real estate-related investments, but UPS emphasizes subjective assumptions and auditor judgment due to the lack of active trading, while LMT\u2019s approach appears more focused on allocation ranges within its broader portfolio strategy.",

In contrast, 3M's 2023 filing references their Certificate of Incorporation that was amended as of December 4, 2017, but does not provide specific details about voting rights tied to amendment processes, making it unclear how 3M's stockholders participate in governance decisions related to certificate amendments.",

      "question": "How does GE's exposure to cost overruns in offshore wind projects compare to General Dynamics' risk profile under fixed-price contracts in defense manufacturing, particularly regarding their ability to offset rising material and labor costs?",
      "answer": "GE's offshore wind projects, such as the Haliade-X platform, face cost overruns due to operational execution risks, including supply chain disruptions and rising labor and material costs, which are difficult to offset under complex, large-scale contracts. Similarly, General Dynamics operates under fixed-price contracts in defense manufacturing, where they assume more risk and are unable to easily pass on cost increases to customers. RTX's 2023 filing highlights that rising material and labor costs under fixed-price contracts can lead to losses, a challenge shared by both companies. However, General Dynamics explicitly structures its profitability around completing work under budget to realize additional profits, whereas GE's exposure is more tied to project complexity and external execution risks beyond its control.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GE \u2192 Cost Overruns: GE's offshore wind projects, like Haliade-X, face cost overruns due to supply chain, labor, and execution risks under complex contracts.",
        "Hop 2: Cost Overruns \u2192 Fixed-Price Contracts: Rising material and labor costs under fixed-price contracts can lead to losses, as noted in RTX's 2023 filing.",
        "Hop 3: Fixed-Price Contracts \u2190 GD: General Dynamics primarily uses fixed-price contracts, assuming more risk but offering potential for additional profit if work is completed under budget."

      "question": "How does RTX's financial exposure to FAR-regulated U.S. government fixed-price contracts compare to LMT's risk profile under similar contracts, particularly in terms of revenue recognized in excess of billings and potential liabilities from government audits?",
      "answer": "RTX reports that under U.S. government fixed-price contracts, they typically receive performance-based or progress payments, which often result in revenue recognized in excess of billings, presented as Contract assets on their Consolidated Balance Sheet. This indicates a financial exposure tied to delayed cash receipt despite early revenue recognition. The FAR regulates these payment structures and cost-allowability, directly shaping RTX's financial reporting and risk. Similarly, LMT, which is also heavily dependent on U.S. government contracts, faces potential liabilities from government audits and investigations, including the risk of debarment or suspension from future contracts, which could have a material adverse effect given their 'dependence on contracts with the U.S. Government.' While RTX's exposure is primarily balance sheet-related (e.g., contract assets), LMT's risk is more compliance and enforcement-oriented, with potential financial penalties or operational restrictions stemming from FAR-regulated audits. Both companies are therefore financially and operationally impacted by the FAR\u2019s regulatory framework, but through different risk mechanisms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: RTX \u2192 FAR: RTX is subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which governs pricing and payment structures for U.S. government contracts. RTX recognizes revenue in excess of billings under fixed-price contracts, resulting in contract assets on its balance sheet.",
        "Hop 2: FAR \u2192 U.S. Government Contracts: The FAR regulates the allowability and allocation of costs in U.S. government contracts and subjects contractors to audits and reviews, influencing both financial reporting and compliance risk.",
        "Hop 3: U.S. Government Contracts \u2190 LMT: LMT is heavily dependent on U.S. government contracts and faces material adverse risks from government audits, including potential fines, penalties, or debarment, which are governed by the same FAR framework."

The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment.  Such  advances  are  not  considered  a  significant  financing  component  because  they  are  used  to  meet  working  capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress, as sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of performing services under the contract is incurred on an other-than-straight-line basis. For some of our long-term aftermarket contracts, we receive payment prior to delivery of products and services, resulting in a contract liability balance, while for others, we deliver products or services in advance of payment, resulting in a contract asset balance.\n\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services that are not distinct are accounted for as part of the existing contract either on a cumulative catch-up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification.\n\nLoss provisions on contracts are recognized to the extent that estimated contract costs exceed the estimated consideration from the products or services contemplated under the contractual arrangement. For new commitments, we generally record loss provisions at contract signing except for certain contracts under which losses are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates us to perform. For existing commitments, anticipated losses on contractual arrangements are recognized in the period in which losses become evident. In estimating losses, products contemplated under contractual arrangements include firm quantities of product sold under contract and, in the commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, future highly probable sales of replacement parts required by regulation that are expected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment. In our commercial engine  and  wheels  and  brakes  businesses,  when  the  OEM  product  is  sold  for  a  loss,  but  the  combined  OEM  and  aftermarket arrangement for each individual sales campaign is profitable, we record OEM product losses at the time of product delivery.\n\nWe review our Estimate at Completion (EACs) on significant contracts on a periodic basis and for others, no less than annually or when  a  change  in  circumstances  warrant  a  modification  to  a  previous  estimate.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  work  required  to  be performed on many of the Company's performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks  and  opportunities  relate  to  management's  judgment  about  the  ability  and  cost  to  achieve  the  schedule,  consideration  of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or  aircraft  landings,  and  related  variable  consideration.  Management's  judgment  related  to  these  considerations  has  become increasingly more significant given the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity  and  scope  of  the  work  to  be  performed,  the  availability  and  cost  of  materials,  the  length  of  time  to  complete  the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives  of  components,  among  others.  Cost  estimates  may  also  include  the  estimated  cost  of  satisfying  our  industrial  cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts primarily within our RIS and RMD",

We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.\n\n## REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

These types of matters could result in fines, penalties, cost reimbursements or contributions, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that the outcome of each of these matters, including the legal proceedings described below, will have a material adverse effect on the corporation as a whole, notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any matter may have a material effect on our net earnings and cash flows in any particular interim reporting period. Among the factors that we consider in this assessment are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if estimable), the progress of the case, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar cases and the experience of other companies, the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond to the proceeding or claim. Our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress.\n\nAs a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to various audits and investigations by the U.S. Government to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  U.S.  Government investigations of us, whether relating to government contracts or conducted for other reasons, could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines or penalties being imposed upon us, suspension, proposed debarment, debarment from eligibility for future U.S. Government contracting, or suspension of export privileges. Suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our dependence on contracts with the U.S. Government. U.S. Government investigations often take years to complete and many result in no adverse action against us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S., which are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations and foreign procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with local regulations or applicable U.S. Government regulations also may be audited or investigated.\n\nIn  the  normal  course  of  business,  we  provide  warranties  to  our  customers  associated  with  certain  product  sales. We  record estimated warranty costs in the period in which the related products are delivered. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date is based generally on the number of months of warranty coverage remaining for the products delivered and the average historical  monthly  warranty  payments.  Warranty  obligations  incurred  in  connection  with  long-term  production  contracts  are accounted for within the contract estimates at completion.\n\nAlthough  we  cannot  predict  the  outcome  of  legal  or  other  proceedings  with  certainty,  where  there  is  at  least  a  reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, GAAP requires us to disclose an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss or make a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. We follow a thorough process in which we seek to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, and only if we are unable to make such an estimate do we conclude and disclose that an estimate  cannot  be  made. Accordingly,  unless  otherwise  indicated  below  in  our  discussion  of  legal  proceedings,  a  reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding cannot be estimated.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\n## United States of America, ex rel. Patzer; Cimma v. Sikorsky Aircraft Corp., et al\n\nAs  a  result  of  our  acquisition  of  Sikorsky Aircraft  Corporation  (Sikorsky),  we  assumed  the  defense  of  and  any  potential liability for two civil False Claims Act lawsuits pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. In October 2014, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in intervention in the first suit, which was brought by qui tam relator Mary Patzer, a former Derco Aerospace (Derco) employee. In May 2017, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in intervention in a second suit, which was brought by qui tam relator Peter Cimma, a former Sikorsky Support Services, Inc. (SSSI) employee. In November 2017, the Court consolidated the cases into a single action for discovery and trial.\n\nThe U.S. Government alleges that Sikorsky and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Derco and SSSI, violated the civil False Claims Act and the Truth in Negotiations Act in connection with a contract the U.S. Navy awarded to SSSI in June 2006 to support the Navy's T-34 and T-44 fixed-wing turboprop training aircraft. SSSI subcontracted with Derco, primarily to procure and manage spare parts for the training aircraft. The U.S. Government contends that SSSI overbilled the Navy on the contract as the result of Derco's use of prohibited cost-plus-percentage-of-cost (CPPC) pricing to add profit and overhead costs as a percentage of the price of the spare parts that Derco procured and then sold to SSSI. The U.S. Government also alleges that Derco's claims to SSSI, SSSI's claims to the Navy, and SSSI's yearly Certificates of Final Indirect Costs from 2006 through 2012 were false and that SSSI submitted inaccurate cost or pricing data in violation of the Truth in Negotiations Act for a sole-sourced, follow-on 'bridge' contract.  The  U.S.  Government's  complaints  assert  common  law  claims  for  breach  of  contract  and  unjust  enrichment.  On November 29,  2021,  the  District  Court  granted  the  U.S.  Government's  motion  for  partial  summary  judgment,  finding  that  the Derco-SSSI agreement was a CPPC contract.\n\nWe believe that we have legal and factual defenses to the U.S. Government's remaining claims. The U.S. Government seeks damages of approximately $52 million, subject to trebling, plus statutory penalties. Although we continue to evaluate our liability and exposure, we do not currently believe that it is probable that we will incur a material loss. If, contrary to our",

      "question": "How do the financial impacts of fixed-price contract losses on LMT's classified Aeronautics program compare to BA's Commercial Crew program losses in 2023, considering both companies' exposure to cost overruns?",
      "answer": "In 2023, LMT reported cumulative losses of approximately $270 million on a classified fixed-price incentive fee contract at its Aeronautics segment, with potential for additional losses if performance issues or cost growth continue. Meanwhile, BA recorded $1,585 million of additional losses on its Commercial Crew program, a key fixed-price development contract under BDS. Both programs highlight the financial risks associated with fixed-price contracts when cost overruns occur, with LMT's losses being significant but notably smaller in magnitude compared to BA's exposure on the Commercial Crew program.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LMT \u2192 Fixed-Price Contracts: LMT disclosed cumulative losses of $270 million on a classified fixed-price incentive fee contract at its Aeronautics segment as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Fixed-Price Contracts \u2192 Cost Overruns: RTX's 2023 filing explicitly states that increasing material, component, and labor prices subject fixed-price contracts to losses in the event of cost overruns.",
        "Hop 3: Cost Overruns \u2190 BA: BA reported $1,585 million of additional losses on its Commercial Crew program, a major fixed-price development contract under BDS, during the year ended December 31, 2023."

      "answer": "UPS explicitly stated it did not elect to apply the practical expedients provided under ASU 2020-04 when transitioning its affected debt instruments to SOFR in 2023. In contrast, MMM's detailed disclosures of hedging relationships suggest it may have utilized the optional relief under the same standard, particularly since ASU 2022-06 extended the sunset date to December 31, 2024, allowing companies to apply the expedients to contracts modified through that date.

      "question": "How might Boeing's acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems and subsequent FAA production rate restrictions impact Honeywell's ability to meet delivery timelines for its MAX 10 avionics integration program, given Honeywell's partnership with Boeing on next-generation flight deck systems?",
      "answer": "Boeing's acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems includes a binding term sheet with Airbus and is subject to regulatory approvals, with a potential closing date in mid-2025. However, the FAA has restricted Boeing from increasing 737 production rates beyond 38 per month until quality and safety standards are met, following the Alaska Airlines 737-9 accident in January 2024. Since Honeywell is partnered with Boeing on avionics integration for the MAX 10 program, any delays in Boeing's production timelines due to FAA restrictions or merger-related operational shifts could directly impact Honeywell\u2019s delivery schedules for critical flight deck systems. This creates a dependency chain where Honeywell\u2019s program execution is indirectly constrained by both Boeing\u2019s internal restructuring and external regulatory constraints.",

        "Hop 1: BA \u2192 Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc.: The FAA has restricted Boeing from increasing 737 production rates beyond 38 per month due to quality control concerns related to Spirit\u2019s manufacturing processes.",
        "Hop 2: Spirit AeroSystems \u2192 Boeing: Boeing plans to acquire Spirit in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $4.7 billion, which includes Spirit\u2019s commercial operations and is expected to close mid-2025, pending regulatory approvals.",
        "Hop 3: Boeing \u2190 HON: Honeywell is partnered with Boeing on avionics integration for the 737 MAX 10, specifically providing next-generation flight deck systems, which are essential to aircraft delivery timelines."

The U.S. gov ernment can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.\n\nCommercial  Aircraft. In  the  U.S.,  our  commercial  aircraft  products  are  required  to  comply  with  FAA  regulations  gov erning  production  and  quality systems, airworthiness and installation approv als, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. For example, as a result of the Alaska Airlines 737-9 accident in January 2024, the FAA inv estigated the 737 quality control system, including Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (Spirit), and increased its  ov ersight  of  our  production  and  quality  and  safety  management  systems.  In  addition,  the  FAA  communicated  it  will  not  approv e  production  rate increases beyond 38 per month or additional production lines until Boeing has complied with required quality and safety standards. New aircraft models and  new  deriv ativ e  aircraft  are  required  to  obtain  FAA  certification  prior  to  entry  into  serv ice.  Outside  the  U.S.,  similar  requirements  exist  for airworthiness, installation and operational approv als. T hese requirements are generally administered by the national av iation authorities of each country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Union Av iation Safety Agency.\n\nEnvironmental. We  are  subject  to  v arious  federal,  state,  local  and  non-U.S.  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  env ironmental  protection,  including  the utilization,  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal  and  remediation  of  hazardous  substances  and  wastes.  We  could  also  be  affected  by  laws  and regulations relating to climate change, including laws limiting or otherwise related to greenhouse gas emissions. These laws and regulations could lead to increased env ironmental compliance expenditures, increased energy and raw materials costs and new and/or additional inv estment in designs and technologies.  We  continually  assess  our  compliance  status  and  management  of  env ironmental  matters  to  monitor  compliance  with  applicable environmental  laws  and  regulations.  Inv estigation,  remediation  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  associated  with  env ironmental  compliance  and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. gov ernment. It is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued env ironmental compliance could hav e a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are discov ered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of inv estigations. For additional information relating to env ironmental contingencies, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nNon-U.S. Sales. Our non-U.S. sales are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. gov ernmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, tariffs, inv estment, exchange controls, anti-corruption and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S. sales are also subject to v arying currency, political and economic risks.\n\n## Raw Materials, Parts and Subassemblies\n\nWe are highly dependent on the av ailability and quality of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. T he most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions)  and  composites  (including  carbon  and  boron).  Although  alternativ e  sources  generally  exist  for  these  raw  materials,  qualification  of  the sources could take a year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis. We continue to work with a small number of sole-source suppliers to ensure continuity of supply for certain items.\n\n## Suppliers\n\nWe are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and deliv ery schedules at our anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensiv e qualification and performance surv eillance system to control risk",

(Spirit) in an all-stock transaction at an equity v alue of approximately $4,700, or $37.25 per share of Spirit Class A Common Stock. The transaction will include the assumption of Spirit's net debt at closing.\n\nEach share of Spirit common stock will be exchanged for a number of shares of Boeing common stock equal to an exchange ratio between 0.18 and 0.25, calculated as $37.25 div ided by the v olume weighted av erage share price of Boeing shares ov er the 15-trading-day period ending on the second trading day prior to the closing (subject to a floor of $149.00 per share and a ceiling of $206.94 per share). Spirit stockholders will receiv e 0.25 Boeing shares for each of their Spirit shares if the v olume-weighted av erage price is at or below $149.00, and 0.18 Boeing shares for each of their Spirit shares if the v olume-weighted av erage price is at or abov e $206.94 per share.\n\nBoeing's acquisition of Spirit will include substantially all Boeing-related commercial operations, as well as certain other operations.\n\nSpirit has also entered into a binding term sheet with Airbus SE (Airbus) setting forth the terms upon which Airbus will, assuming the parties enter into definitiv e agreements and receiv e all required regulatory approv als, acquire certain commercial work packages that Spirit performs for Airbus concurrently with the closing of the Boeing-Spirit merger.

      "answer": "RTX recognizes revenue in excess of billings on U.S. government fixed-price contracts due to retained customer payments until contract completion, typically receiving performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments covering 80-90% of costs incurred. This creates contract assets on their balance sheet. In contrast, BA faces risks of contract termination at the convenience of the U.S. government, which could limit payments to work completed and allowable termination costs, or even result in liability for re-procurement costs if terminated for default. The FAR regulations that govern both companies' U.S. government contracts allow for interim payments but expose contractors to different financial risks\u2014RTX to cash flow timing mismatches, and BA to potential revenue reversals or liabilities\u2014making BA's cash flow more unpredictable despite similar regulatory frameworks.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nproviding services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment.  Such  advances  are  not  considered  a  significant  financing  component  because  they  are  used  to  meet  working  capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress, as sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of performing services under the contract is incurred on an other-than-straight-line basis. For some of our long-term aftermarket contracts, we receive payment prior to delivery of products and services, resulting in a contract liability balance, while for others, we deliver products or services in advance of payment, resulting in a contract asset balance.\n\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services that are not distinct are accounted for as part of the existing contract either on a cumulative catch-up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification.\n\nLoss provisions on contracts are recognized to the extent that estimated contract costs exceed the estimated consideration from the products or services contemplated under the contractual arrangement. For new commitments, we generally record loss provisions at contract signing except for certain contracts under which losses are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates us to perform. For existing commitments, anticipated losses on contractual arrangements are recognized in the period in which losses become evident. In estimating losses, products contemplated under contractual arrangements include firm quantities of product sold under contract and, in the commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, future highly probable sales of replacement parts required by regulation that are expected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment. In our commercial engine  and  wheels  and  brakes  businesses,  when  the  OEM  product  is  sold  for  a  loss,  but  the  combined  OEM  and  aftermarket arrangement for each individual sales campaign is profitable, we record OEM product losses at the time of product delivery.\n\nWe review our Estimate at Completion (EACs) on significant contracts on a periodic basis and for others, no less than annually or when  a  change  in  circumstances  warrant  a  modification  to  a  previous  estimate.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  work  required  to  be performed on many of the Company's performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks  and  opportunities  relate  to  management's  judgment  about  the  ability  and  cost  to  achieve  the  schedule,  consideration  of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or  aircraft  landings,  and  related  variable  consideration.  Management's  judgment  related  to  these  considerations  has  become increasingly more significant given the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity  and  scope  of  the  work  to  be  performed,  the  availability  and  cost  of  materials,  the  length  of  time  to  complete  the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives  of  components,  among  others.  Cost  estimates  may  also  include  the  estimated  cost  of  satisfying  our  industrial  cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts primarily within our RIS and RMD",

We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.\n\n## REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

We aspire to achieve zero workplace injuries and provide a safe, open and accountable work environment for our employees. We provide several channels for all employees to speak up, ask for guidance and report concerns related to ethics or safety violations. We address employee concerns and take appropriate actions that uphold our Boeing values.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe  commercial  jet  aircraft  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  We  face  aggressive international  competitors  who  are  intent  on  increasing  their  market  share,  such  as  Airbus  and  other  entrants  from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with higher quality products.\n\nBDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Technologies Corporation, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their  North American  operations  and  partnering  with  U.S.  defense  companies.  In  addition,  certain  competitors  have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2022.\n\nThe commercial and defense services markets are extremely challenging and are made up of many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering products and services which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial airplane programs: training, fleet services and logistics, maintenance and engineering, modifications and upgrades, as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. BGS expects the market to remain highly competitive in 2022, and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\nOur businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We work with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to, all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.\n\nGovernment Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our  U.S.  government  contracts  were  to  be  terminated  for  convenience,  we  generally  would  be  entitled  to  receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.\n\nCommercial  Aircraft. In  the  U.S.,  our  commercial  aircraft  products  are  required  to  comply  with  FAA  regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. New aircraft models and new derivative aircraft are required to obtain FAA certification prior to entry into  service.

The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.0 billion (at lender's discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.25 billion. The credit facility was undrawn at December 31, 2024. Under the $4.25 billion credit facility, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (based on amounts defined in the amended agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest ex pense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2024, 3M was in compliance with this requirement. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.\n\nOther Credit Facilities: The Company also had $0.5 billion in stand-alone letters of credit, bank guarantees, and other similar instruments issued and outstanding at December 31, 2024. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n\nSolventum Related Debt: In the first quarter of 2024, Solventum, prior to the Separation discussed in Note 2, issued a total of $8.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured debt and term loans. Also during the first quarter of 2024, Solventum further entered into a revolving credit facility of $2 billion which was undrawn as of March 31, 2024. These Solventum items were guaranteed by 3M until the completion of the Separation on April 1, 2024 and obligations under these notes, loans and facilities became, as transferred obligations, the sole responsibility of Solventum after the Separation.\n\nFixed-to-Floating Interest Rate Swaps: During 2021, 3M entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $800 million. These swaps converted $500 million and $300 million of 3M's $1 billion and $650 million principal amount of fix ed rate notes due 2049 and 2050, respectively, into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms through mid-2028 with an original interest rate based on a three-month LIBOR index, which since was amended to a rate based on a SOFR index.\n\nLong-Term Debt Maturities and Extinguishments: In 2024, 3M repaid $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn 2023, 3M repaid $500 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate registered notes that matured, $650 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate mediumterm notes that matured and 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nIn 2022, 3M repaid 500 million euros aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured and $600 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.\n\nFloating Rate Notes: At various times, 3M has issued floating rate notes containing put provisions, amounting to $0.2 billion in total. 3M would be required to repurchase these securities at various prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value according to the reduction schedules for each security. Under the terms of this floating rate note due in 2044, holders have an annual put feature at 100 percent of par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final maturity. Under the terms of the floating rate notes due in 2027, 2040 and 2041, holders have put options that commence ten years from the date of issuance and each third anniversary thereafter until final maturity at prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value.

International equities are comprised of companies domiciled in developed nations outside the U.S. Emerging market equities are comprised of companies domiciled in portions of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Corporate bonds represent inv estment-grade debt of issuers primarily from the U.S. Gov ernment bonds include inv estment-grade instruments issued by federal, state and local gov ernments, primarily in the U.S. Other includes cash, interests in mixed asset funds inv esting in commodities, natural resources, agriculture, real estate and infrastructure funds, life insurance contracts (U.S.), and shares in certain general inv estment funds of financial institutions or insurance arrangements (non-U.S.) that typically ensure no market losses or prov ide for a small minimum return guarantee.\n\n## Fair Value Hierarchy Categories\n\nValuations of Lev el 1 assets for all classes are based on quoted closing market prices from the principal exchanges where the indiv idual securities are traded. Cash is v alued at cost, which approximates fair v alue. Debt securities categorized as Lev el 2 assets are generally v alued based on independent broker/dealer bids or by comparison to other debt securities hav ing similar durations, yields and credit ratings. Valuation techniques and inputs for these assets include discounted cash flow analysis, earnings multiple approaches, recent transactions, transfer restrictions, prev ailing discount rates, volatilities, credit ratings and other factors. In the Other class, interests in mixed asset funds are Lev el 2, and U.S. life insurance contracts and non-U.S. general fund inv estments and insurance arrangements are Lev el 3. Inv estments measured at NAV are primarily nonexchange-traded commingled or collectiv e funds where the underlying securities hav e observ able prices av ailable from activ e markets and typically prov ide liquidity daily or within a few days. The NAV category also includes fund inv estments in priv ate equities, real estate and infrastructure where the fair v alue of the underlying assets is determined by the inv estment manager. Total unfunded commitments for the priv ate equity funds were approximately $90 at September 30, 2024. These inv estments cannot be redeemed, but instead the funds will make distributions through liquidation of the underlying assets, which is expected to occur over approximately the next 10 years. The real estate and infrastructure funds typically offer quarterly redemption.\n\n## Postretirement Plans\n\nThe Company also sponsors unfunded postretirement benefit plans (primarily health care) for certain U.S. retirees and their dependents. The Company's principal U.S. postretirement plan has been frozen to new employees since 1993. The postretirement benefit liability for all plans was $71 and $72 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely, and included deferred actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensiv e income of $68 and $95, respectiv ely. Serv ice and interest costs are negligible and more than offset by the amortization of deferred actuarial gains, which resulted in net postretirement income of $18 for 2024, $19 for 2023 and $12 for 2022.

Debt securities categorized as Lev el 2 assets are generally v alued based on independent broker/dealer bids or by comparison to other debt securities hav ing similar durations, yields and credit ratings. Valuation techniques and inputs for these assets include discounted cash flow analysis, earnings multiple approaches, recent transactions, transfer restrictions, prev ailing discount rates, volatilities, credit ratings and other factors. In the Other class, interests in mixed asset funds are Lev el 2, and U.S. life insurance contracts and non-U.S. general fund inv estments and insurance arrangements are Lev el 3. Inv estments measured at NAV are primarily nonexchange-traded commingled or collectiv e funds where the underlying securities hav e observ able prices av ailable from activ e markets and typically prov ide liquidity daily or within a few days. The NAV category also includes fund inv estments in priv ate equities, real estate and infrastructure where the fair v alue of the underlying assets is determined by the inv estment manager. Total unfunded commitments for the priv ate equity funds were approximately $90 at September 30, 2024. These inv estments cannot be redeemed, but instead the funds will make distributions through liquidation of the underlying assets, which is expected to occur over approximately the next 10 years. The real estate and infrastructure funds typically offer quarterly redemption.\n\n## Postretirement Plans\n\nThe Company also sponsors unfunded postretirement benefit plans (primarily health care) for certain U.S. retirees and their dependents. The Company's principal U.S. postretirement plan has been frozen to new employees since 1993. The postretirement benefit liability for all plans was $71 and $72 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectiv ely, and included deferred actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensiv e income of $68 and $95, respectiv ely. Serv ice and interest costs are negligible and more than offset by the amortization of deferred actuarial gains, which resulted in net postretirement income of $18 for 2024, $19 for 2023 and $12 for 2022.

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin's PSUs include up to 723,136 shares that could be earned under the 2020 IPA Plan, with payouts contingent on performance metrics over a three-year period. Similarly, AspenTech's PSU program, which was inherited and continued post-acquisition by Emerson, also includes performance conditions tied to predefined goals such as annual contract value and free cash flows. Emerson's acquisition of Heritage AspenTech and the continuation of its PSU program reflect a strategic alignment in using performance-based equity compensation to retain talent and incentivize post-acquisition integration success.

AspenTech, as defined in Note 4, operates as a separate publicly traded company and has v arious stock-based compensation plans, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units, which are settled in their own common stock and are accounted for as equity awards. Restricted stock units and performance stock units generally v est ov er three years. In fiscal 2023 and 2024, the Company granted performance stock units with both a performance and serv ice condition. The performance condition relates to the attainment of predefined goals based on annual contract v alue and free cash flows. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the probability that the threshold performance goals will be achiev ed, if at all, and the anticipated lev el of attainment to determine the amount of compensation expense to record in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Option awards hav e been granted with an exercise price equal to the market closing price of AspenTech's stock on the trading day prior to the grant date. These options generally v est ov er four years and expire within sev en years or ten years of grant. AspenTech's policy is to issue new shares upon the exercise of v ested stock awards.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement between Emerson and Heritage AspenTech, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock, whether vested or unvested, that was unexercised as of immediately prior to the closing date was conv erted into an option to acquire shares of AspenTech. Each conv erted option is subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original option. In addition, each outstanding award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock that were unv ested as of immediately prior to the closing date was conv erted into an award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of AspenTech. Each conv erted restricted stock unit is also subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original restricted stock unit.\n\nASC 805 required the Company to determine the fair v alue of the AspenTech share-based payment awards related to the replacement of the Heritage AspenTech share-based payment awards, and allocate the total fair v alue based on the serv ices that are attributable to the pre- and post-combination serv ice periods, respectiv ely. The portion that is attributable to the pre-combination serv ice period was considered part of the consideration transferred for Heritage AspenTech and included as part of the purchase price. The portion that is attributable to the post-combination serv ice period is recognized as stock-based compensation expense in the post-combination consolidated financial statements ov er the remaining requisite serv ice period.\n\n## AspenTech Stock Options\n\nAspenTech utilizes the Black-Scholes option v aluation model for estimating the fair v alue of options granted. The Black-Scholes option v aluation model incorporates assumptions regarding expected stock price v olatility, the expected life of the option, the risk-free interest rate, div idend yield and the market value of AspenTech's common stock. The expected stock price v olatility is determined based on AspenTech's stock's historic prices ov er a period commensurate with the expected life of the award. The expected life of an option represents the period for which options are expected to be outstanding as determined by historic option exercises and cancellations. The risk-free",

Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis). AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech's prev ious name 'Aspen Technology, Inc.' and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under AspenTech's previous stock ticker symbol 'AZPN.'

Gross profit was $8,885 in 2024 compared to $7,427 in 2023, while gross margin increased 1.8 percentage points to 50.8 percent, reflecting the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition and higher price partially offset by the impact from acquisition-related inv entory step-up amortization of $231, which negativ ely impacted margins by approximately 1.3 percentage points.\n\nCost of sales for 2023 were $7,738, an increase of $240 compared with $7,498 in 2022. Gross profit was $7,427 in 2023 compared to $6,306 in 2022, while gross margin increased 3.3 percentage points to 49.0 percent due to fav orable price less net material inflation, the impact of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition which benefited margins by 0.6 percentage points, and fav orable mix.\n\n## SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $5,142 in 2024 increased $956 compared with 2023 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.8 percentage points to 29.4 percent, reflecting the impact of the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition, partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $4,186 in 2023 increased $572 compared with 2022 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.4 percentage points to 27.6 percent, reflecting the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and higher stock compensation expense of $125, of which $75 related to Emerson stock plans due to a higher share price and $50 was attributable to AspenTech stock plans. These items were partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\n## SALE OF COPELAND NOTE RECEIVABLE AND EQUITY INTEREST\n\nOn June 6, 2024, the Company entered into definitiv e agreements to sell its 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to priv ate equity funds managed by Blackstone for $1.5 billion and its note receiv able to Copeland for $1.9 billion, and the transactions were subsequently completed in August 2024. Upon entering into the note agreement, the Company recorded a pretax loss in continuing operations of $279 ($217 after-tax, $0.38 per share) to adjust the carrying v alue of the note to $1.9 billion to reflect the transaction price, while the Company recognized a gain of $539 ($435 after-tax) in discontinued operations upon the sale of the common equity interest.

ASU 2022-06 applies to such hedging relationships and contract modifications through December 31, 2024, and UPS has applied this guidance without material impact. Similarly, FDX is subject to ASU 2022-06 and continues to monitor its contracts referencing LIBOR or other discontinued rates, with no material effect on financial condition or results of operations as of May 31, 2024.

      "answer": "CAT used pricing models with unobservable inputs to value non-U.S. pension assets measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs, which involved $59 million in settlements and $15 million in unrealized losses in 2024. These models reflect assumptions a market participant would use, as required by fair value accounting. Level 3 valuation, as defined in the evidence, relies on pricing models and discounted cash flow (DCF) methodologies with significant unobservable assumptions. GE, in turn, applies Level 3 valuation techniques in its run-off insurance operations, particularly in measuring liabilities for investment contracts and future policy benefit reserves, where unobservable inputs significantly influence the present value calculations of future obligations. This shows that both companies rely on Level 3 valuation methods involving unobservable assumptions, but CAT applies them to pension assets while GE uses them for insurance liabilities, directly affecting their respective financial reporting and earnings volatility.",

The activity in our non-U.S. pension Level 3 assets involved insurance contracts. During 2024, activity was settlements of $59 million and unrealized losses of $15 million. During 2023, activity was purchases of $633 million, settlements of $9 million and unrealized gains of $51 million. We valued these instruments using pricing models that, in management's judgment, reflect the assumptions a market participant would use.\n\n## E. Defined contribution plans\n\nWe have both  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  employee  defined  contribution  plans  to  help  employees  save  for  retirement. Our  primary  U.S.  401(k)  plan  allows  eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the plan. Employees are eligible for matching contributions equal to 100 percent of employee contributions to the plan up to 6 percent of cash compensation and an annual employer contribution that ranges from 3  to 5 percent of cash compensation (depending on years of service and age).\n\nThese 401(k) plans include various investment funds, including a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the ESOP  held 10.4  million  and 11.3  million  shares,  respectively. We  allocate  all  of  the  shares  held  by  the  ESOP  to  participant  accounts. Dividends  paid  to participants are automatically reinvested into company shares unless the participant elects to have all or a portion of the dividend paid to the participant. Various other U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans generally allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the plans, and in most cases, we provide a matching contribution to the funds.",

          "chunk_text": "INSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include providing insurance and reinsurance for life and health risks and providing certain annuity products. Primary product types include long-term care, structured settlement annuities, life and disability insurance contracts and investment contracts. Insurance contracts are contracts with significant mortality and/or morbidity risks, while investment contracts are contracts without such risks. Insurance revenue is comprised primarily of premiums and investment income. For traditional long-duration insurance contracts, we report premiums as revenue when due. Premiums received on non-traditional long-duration insurance contracts and investment contracts, including annuities without significant mortality risk, are not reported as revenue but rather as deposit liabilities. We recognize revenue for charges and assessments on these contracts, mostly for mortality, administration and surrender. Interest credited to policyholder accounts is charged to expense.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions. A s a run-off insurance operation consisting substantially all of reinsurance, contracts are grouped into cohorts by legal entity and product type, based on the date the reinsurance contract was consummated. Future policy benefit reserves are adjusted each period as a result of updating lifetime net premium ratios for differences between actual and expected experience with the retroactive effect of those variances recognized in current period earnings. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings.\n\nAs our insurance operations are in run-off, the locked-in discount rate is used for the computation of interest accretion on future policy benefit reserves recognized in earnings. However, cash flows used to estimate future policy benefit reserves are also discounted using an upper-medium grade (i.e., low credit risk) fixedincome instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristics of the liabilities and is updated each reporting period with changes recorded in A ccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). As a result, changes in the current discount rate at each reporting period are recognized as an adjustment to A OCI and not earnings each period, whereas, changes relating to cash flow assumptions are recognized in the Statement of Earnings (Loss).\n\nLiabilities for inv estment contracts equal the account value, that is, the amount that accrues to the benefit of the contract or policyholder including credited interest and assessments through the financial statement date. See Note 12 for further information.\n\nPOSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. We sponsor a number of pension and retiree health and life insurance benefit plans that we present in three categories, principal pension plans, other pension plans and principal retiree benefit plans. We use a December 31 measurement date for these plans. On our Statement of Financial Position, we measure our plan assets at fair value and the obligations at the present value of the estimated payments to plan participants. Participants earn benefits based on their service and pay. Those estimated future payment amounts are determined based on assumptions. Differences between our actual results and what we assumed are recorded in a separate component of equity each period. These differences are amortized into earnings over the remaining average future service of active employees or the expected life of inactive participants, as applicable, who participate in the plan. See Note 13 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability  in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROG RAMS. We evaluate supply chain finance programs to ensure where we use a third-party intermediary to settle our trade payables, their inv olv ement does not change the nature, existence, amount or timing of our trade payables and does not provide the Company with any direct economic benefit. If any  characteristics of the trade pay ables change or we receive a direct economic benefit, we reclassify the trade payables as borrowings.\n\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. The following sections describe the valuation methodologies we use to measure financial and non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value including certain assets within our pension plans and retiree benefit plans. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These inputs establish a fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and Level 3 Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.\n\n46 2024 FORM  10-K",

      "question": "How do RTX's and LMT's exposures to cost overruns under fixed-price contracts compare, particularly in terms of their impact on profitability and contract performance expectations?",
      "answer": "RTX explicitly states that increasing material, component, and labor prices could subject them to losses in fixed-price contracts in the event of cost overruns, directly impacting operating profit and margin. LMT similarly notes that fixed-price contracts shift risk to the contractor, with cost overruns potentially leading to lower margins or losses over the contract term. Both companies emphasize that failure to control costs under fixed-price contracts can significantly affect profitability and cash flow, but RTX specifically ties this risk to macroeconomic pressures like inflation, while LMT highlights procurement policy shifts and competitive bidding dynamics as contributing factors.",

      "question": "How does FDX's exposure to LIBOR-related hedging adjustments under ASU 2022-06 compare to UPS's use of hedging relationships, particularly in light of ASU 2022-06's extended sunset date through 2024?",
      "answer": "FDX has stated that reference rate reform, including ASU 2022-06, has had no material effect on its financial condition or results of operations as of May 31, 2024, though it continues to monitor contracts for potential application of the standard. ASU 2022-06 extends the sunset date for optional expedients and exceptions related to reference rate reform\u2014including LIBOR transitions\u2014to December 31, 2024. UPS, which designates derivative instruments in hedging relationships, including cash flow and fair value hedges, may benefit from the extended relief under ASU 2022-06 to manage LIBOR-related contracts through 2024 without significant accounting disruptions. Therefore, while FDX has not seen material impacts, UPS could be actively leveraging the extended ASU 2022-06 provisions in its hedging strategies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: FDX \u2192 ASU 2022-06: FDX is subject to ASU 2022-06 and notes that reference rate reform has had no material effect on its financials as of May 31, 2024, but continues to monitor its contracts.",
        "Hop 2: ASU 2022-06 \u2192 Hedging Relationships: ASU 2022-06 extends the sunset date for optional hedging-related accounting relief tied to reference rate reform (e.g., LIBOR transitions) to December 31, 2024.",
        "Hop 3: Hedging Relationships \u2190 UPS: UPS designates derivatives into hedging relationships (cash flow, fair value, and net investment hedges), which could be impacted by the extended relief under ASU 2022-06."

          "chunk_text": "## FedEx Ground Segment\n\n## Overview\n\nBy leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low-cost structure, and efficiently using information technology and advanced automation systems, FedEx Ground continues to enhance its competitive position as a leading provider of business and residential money-back guaranteed ground package delivery services. As of July 15, 2022, the money-back guarantee for all FedEx Ground services remains temporarily suspended in order to balance our focus on service and safety. FedEx Ground serves customers in the North American small-package market, focusing on business and residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Ground service is provided to 100% of the continental U.S. population and overnight service of up to 400 miles to nearly 100% of the continental U.S. population. Service is also provided to nearly 100% of the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx Ground offers service to Alaska and Hawaii through a ground and air network operation coordinated with other transportation providers. FedEx Ground provides seven-day-per-week residential delivery to virtually all of the U.S. population.\n\nThe company offers FedEx Home Delivery service, which reaches 100% of U.S. residences. FedEx Home Delivery is dedicated to meeting the delivery needs of residential customers and provides routine Saturday and evening delivery and premium options such as day-specific, appointment, and signature delivery. Sunday delivery is also provided for virtually all of the U.S. population. FedEx Home Delivery brings unmatched services to residential shippers and their customers and is the first residential ground package delivery service to have offered a money-back guarantee. FedEx Ground Economy service is available for the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages to any residential address or PO Box in the U.S.\n\n## Pricing\n\nFedEx Ground periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guide. In general, U.S. shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, size, any ancillary service charge, and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. Effective January 3, 2022, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery implemented a 5.9% average list price increase. FedEx Ground Economy average list prices also increased.\n\nTo manage demand and capacity constraints in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in June 2020 FedEx Ground implemented a series of surcharges generally applying to shipments that are oversized, unauthorized, or require additional handling; to residential packages for customers meeting a certain volume threshold; and to FedEx Ground Economy shipments. Specific applicable surcharges have been adjusted periodically since their implementation, and higher surcharges were applied during the 2022 holiday peak season. Effective January 17, 2022, the holiday peak surcharges were no longer in effect, and additional surcharges were applied to residential shipments for customers who met certain volume thresholds and to packages delivered or returned using FedEx Ground Economy services. These changes reflect incremental costs associated with the challenging operating environment, while enabling FedEx Ground to continue investing in service enhancement, equipment maintenance, technology innovations, and other areas to serve customers more effectively and efficiently.\n\nFedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two weeks prior to the week in which it is assessed. Effective June 21, 2021, November 1, 2021, and April 4, 2022, the tables used to determine fuel surcharges at FedEx Ground were updated. See the 'Results of Operations and Outlook Consolidated Results - Fuel' section of 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for more information.\n\n## Operations\n\nFedEx Ground operates a highly flexible network of over 680 sortation and distribution facilities, including approximately 160 fully automated stations, in the U.S. and Canada as of May 31, 2022. FedEx Ground conducts its operations primarily with more than 100,000 vehicles owned or leased by independent service providers. To provide FedEx Home Delivery service and FedEx Ground Economy service, FedEx Ground leverages its pickup operation and hub and linehaul network.\n\nIn recent years, FedEx Ground's network expansion has substantially increased the company's daily capacity through the addition of new facilities featuring the latest automated sorting technology as well as the expansion or relocation of existing hubs and other facilities. FedEx Ground has also made significant operational enhancements to ensure safe and reliable handling of large and heavy items. These changes include designing new facilities, adding equipment to certain facilities, and making other operational adjustments.",

      "answer": "LMT applies FAR to its U.S. Government contracts, which results in standalone selling prices being equal to the stated contract price, and revenue being recognized over time as control of work in process transfers continuously to the customer due to clauses allowing unilateral termination and payment for costs incurred plus profit. Similarly, BA notes that U.S. Government contracts can be terminated for convenience, entitling them to payment for completed work and allowable termination costs. This creates a comparable revenue recognition pattern for both companies under FAR-regulated cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts, where revenue is recognized progressively rather than at a point in time, but differences may arise based on contract-specific termination clauses and profit margin negotiations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nincentive based on performance). Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts provide a fixed fee that is negotiated at the inception of the contract and does not vary with actual costs.\n\nWe assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If  combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.\n\nWe evaluate  the  products  or  services  promised  in  each  contract  at  inception  to  determine  whether  the  contract  should  be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have  more  than  one  distinct  performance  obligation,  which  occurs  when  we  perform  activities  that  are  not  highly  complex  or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.\n\nWe determine the transaction  price  for  each  contract  based  on  the  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  for  the  products  or services being provided under the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary, we estimate variable consideration at  the  most  likely  amount,  which  is  included  in  the  transaction  price  to  the  extent  it  is  probable  that  a  significant  reversal  of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.\n\nAt the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently  modified  to  include  changes  in  specifications,  requirements  or  price,  which  may  create  new  or  change  existing enforceable  rights  and  obligations.  Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  modification,  we  consider  whether  to  account  for  the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. Therefore,  such  modifications  are  accounted  for  as  if  they  were  part  of  the  existing  contract  and  recognized  as  a  cumulative adjustment to revenue.\n\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other  products  or  services).  Our  contracts  with  the  U.S.  Government,  including  FMS  contracts,  are  subject  to  the  Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.\n\nFor non-U.S. Government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer's specifications.  When  it  is  necessary  to  allocate  the  transaction  price  to  multiple  performance  obligations,  we  typically  use  the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.\n\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For most contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience  and  pay  us  for  costs  incurred  plus  a  reasonable  profit.  For  most  non-U.S.  Government  contracts,  primarily international direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that  do  not  have  an  alternative  use  to  us  and  if  our  customer  were  to  terminate  the  contract  for  reasons  other  than  our  nonperformance  we  would  have  the  right  to  recover  damages  which  would  include,  among  other  potential  damages,  the  right  to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.",

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

We aspire to achieve zero workplace injuries and provide a safe, open and accountable work environment for our employees. We provide several channels for all employees to speak up, ask for guidance and report concerns related to ethics or safety violations. We address employee concerns and take appropriate actions that uphold our Boeing values.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe  commercial  jet  aircraft  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  We  face  aggressive international  competitors  who  are  intent  on  increasing  their  market  share,  such  as  Airbus  and  other  entrants  from Russia, China and Japan. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with higher quality products.\n\nBDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Technologies Corporation, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their  North American  operations  and  partnering  with  U.S.  defense  companies.  In  addition,  certain  competitors  have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2022.\n\nThe commercial and defense services markets are extremely challenging and are made up of many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering products and services which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial airplane programs: training, fleet services and logistics, maintenance and engineering, modifications and upgrades, as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. BGS expects the market to remain highly competitive in 2022, and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\nOur businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We work with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to, all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.\n\nGovernment Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our  U.S.  government  contracts  were  to  be  terminated  for  convenience,  we  generally  would  be  entitled  to  receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.\n\nCommercial  Aircraft. In  the  U.S.,  our  commercial  aircraft  products  are  required  to  comply  with  FAA  regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. New aircraft models and new derivative aircraft are required to obtain FAA certification prior to entry into  service.  Outside  the  U.S.,  similar  requirements  exist  for  airworthiness,  installation  and  operational  approvals. These requirements are generally",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $990 million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024. There are no expected required contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2025.\n\nThe following table presents estimated future benefit payments as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "\n*In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities then divided by the number of units outstanding and is determined by the investment manager or custodian of the fund. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the fair value of plan assets.\n\nEquities consist primarily of mandates in public equity securities managed to various public equity indices. Publicly traded equities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.\n\nFixed Income investments include domestic and foreign government, and corporate debt securities. The debt securities are valued at the closing price reported if traded on an active market or at yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnership interests in a variety of funds which are valued at NAV as described above. Real estate consists of property funds and REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts). REITS are valued at NAV with published prices provided by the custodians.\n\nAbsolute return consists primarily of private partnership interests in hedge funds, insurance contracts and derivative instruments. Partnerships and hedge funds are valued at NAV as described above. Insurance consists of insurance contracts, which are valued using cash surrender values which is the amount the plan would receive if the contract was cashed out at year end. Derivative instruments consist of various swaps and bond futures that are used to help manage risks and are valued by the custodian using closing market swap curves and market derived input\n\nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include the net of interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased and interest payable. At December 31, 2024 the net payable includes a payable of $88 million to the Canadian Solventum pension.\n\nThe balances of and changes in the fair values of the international pension plans' level 3 assets consist primarily of insurance contracts under the absolute return asset class. In 2024 the aggregate of net purchases and net unrealized gains and losses decreased this balance by $43 million and the change in currency exchange rates decreased this balance by $37 million for a net decrease of $80 million. In 2023 the aggregate net purchases and net unrealized gains increased this balance by $138 million and the change in currency exchange rates increased the balance by $6 million for a net increase to this balance of $144 million.",

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin reports $4,863 million in private equity fund investments valued under the NAV practical expedient, which relies on unobservable inputs in valuation models of underlying securities and typically has terms between 8 and 12 years. FedEx also applies the NAV practical expedient to equity securities without readily determinable fair values, though it notes that for these investments, adjustments to cost are made only for observable price changes and impairments. While Lockheed Martin\u2019s NAV-based private equity investments are part of a broader portfolio including real estate and hedge funds, FedEx specifically highlights immaterial annual and cumulative impairment adjustments under the measurement alternative for such equity securities.",

      "answer": "GD's hedging strategy involves interest rate swap contracts with a dollar-weighted two-year average maturity that generally matches the duration of the activities at risk, indicating a focus on closely aligning hedge instruments with underlying exposure timelines. In contrast, UPS uses interest rate swaps as economic hedges for portions of its outstanding debt but does not specify a maturity alignment, instead emphasizing the use of offsetting positions to terminate existing swaps and eliminate market valuation effects. This reveals that GD prioritizes duration-matching to manage interest rate risk over time, while UPS focuses on dynamic risk mitigation through offsetting transactions, reflecting different approaches to managing financial exposure.",

We have not entered  into  any  material  commodity  hedging  contracts  but  may  do  so  as  circumstances  warrant. We  do  not believe that changes in commodity prices will have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.\n\nInvestment  Risk. Our  investment  policy  allows  for  purchases  of  fixed-income  securities  with  an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years. On December 31, 2021 and 2020, we held $1.6 billion and $2.8 billion in cash and equivalents, respectively, but held no marketable securities other than those  held  in  trust  to  meet  some  of  our  obligations  under  workers'  compensation  and  non-qualified  pension plans. On December 31, 2021 and 2020, we held marketable securities in trust of $191 and $211, respectively. These marketable securities are reflected at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in other current and noncurrent assets. See Note P for additional details.\n\nHedging Activities. On  December 31, 2021, we had notional forward exchange contracts outstanding of $6.8  billion.  On  December  31,  2020,  we  had  notional  forward  exchange  and  interest  rate  swap  contracts outstanding of $9.4 billion. These derivative financial instruments are cash flow hedges, and are reflected at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in other current assets and liabilities. See Note P for additional details.\n\nChanges in fair value (gains and losses) related to derivative financial instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCL until the underlying transaction is reflected in earnings. Alternatively, gains and losses on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded each period in earnings. All gains and losses from derivative financial instruments recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings are presented in the same line item as the underlying transaction, either operating costs and expenses or interest expense.\n\nNet gains and losses recognized in earnings on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting were not material to our results of operations in any of the past three years. Net gains and losses reclassified  to  earnings  from  AOCL  related  to  qualified  hedges  were  also  not  material  to  our  results  of operations in any of the past three years, and we do not expect the amount of these gains and losses that will be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months to be material.\n\nWe had no material derivative financial instruments designated as fair value or net investment hedges on December 31, 2021 or 2020.\n\nForeign Currency Financial Statement Translation. We translate foreign currency balance sheets from our international businesses' functional currency (generally the respective local currency) to U.S. dollars at the end-of-period exchange rates, and statements of earnings at the average exchange rates for each period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are a component of AOCL.\n\nWe do not hedge the fluctuation in reported revenue and earnings resulting from the translation of these international operations' results into U.S. dollars. The impact of translating our non-U.S. operations' revenue and earnings into U.S. dollars was not material to our results of operations in any of the past three years. In addition, the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on non-U.S. cash balances was not material in any of the past three years.",

      "question": "How does the treatment of dividend equivalents on RSU awards differ between CAT's 2023 compensation strategy and LMT's deferred compensation plans, particularly in terms of stock unit valuation and payout timing?",
      "answer": "CAT credits RSU and PRSU awards with dividend equivalent units on each cash dividend payment date and values RSU awards based on the closing stock price on the grant date. LMT also provides dividend equivalents on stock units held under its Deferred Management Incentive Compensation Plan (DMICP), where amounts equal to dividends are credited as additional stock units at the time of dividend payment. However, LMT allows directors who meet stock ownership guidelines to defer receipt of vested stock units and associated dividend equivalents until the first business day of April following the one-year anniversary of the grant, whereas CAT does not specify such deferral options. This reflects a difference in payout timing and deferral flexibility between the two companies' compensation frameworks.",

The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years' digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over 5 years. Capitalized software as a service is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line  method  over  the  term  of  the  hosting  arrangement,  which  is  typically  no  greater  than  10  years.  We  periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.\n\nLong-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Long-lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.\n\nLeases We determine if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at the inception date. Operating leases are included in Other  assets,  with  the  related  liabilities  included  in  Accrued  liabilities  and  Other  long-term  liabilities.  Assets  under finance leases, which primarily represent computer equipment, are included in Property, plant and equipment, net, with the  related  liabilities  included  in  Short-term  debt  and  current  portion  of  long-term  debt  and  Long-term  debt  on  the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\nOperating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. Variable components of the lease payments such as fair market value adjustments, utilities and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and not included in determining the present value. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe have real property lease agreements with lease and non-lease components which are accounted for as a single lease component.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe  record  all  known  asset  retirement  obligations  for  which  the  liability's  fair  value  can  be  reasonably  estimated, including  certain  asbestos  removal,  asset  decommissioning  and  contractual  lease  restoration  obligations.  Recorded amounts are not material.\n\nWe  also  have  known  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations,  such  as  certain  asbestos  remediation  and  asset decommissioning  activities  to  be  performed  in  the  future,  that  are  not  reasonably  estimable  due  to  insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the  liability's  fair  value.  In  addition,  there  may  be  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations  that  we  have  not  yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of",

The impact from a change in liquidity and credit policies could negatively affect the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, create supply chain inefficiencies and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nChanges in monetary and fiscal policies, along with other factors, may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate. Actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country, which could adversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nGovernment policies on taxes and spending also affect our business.  Throughout the world, government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development, such as highways, rail systems, airports, sewer and water systems, waterways and dams.  Tax regulations determine asset depreciation lives and impact the after-tax returns on business activity and investment, both of which influence investment decisions.  Unfavorable developments, such as decisions to reduce public spending or to increase taxes, could negatively impact our results.\n\n## Our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate.\n\nOur global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and economic instability or uncertainty. Some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others.  Our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. Operating in different regions and countries exposes us to numerous risks, including:\n\n- multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change;\n- imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints;\n- imposition of new or additional tariffs or quotas;\n- withdrawal from or modification of trade agreements or the negotiation of new trade agreements;\n- imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments;\n- war or acts of terrorism; and\n- political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.\n\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\n## The success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers' needs.\n\nOur business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products.  To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers, OEMs and end-user customers.  This is dependent on a number of factors, including our",

This is especially concerning given RTX\u2019s inability to renegotiate contract values on such agreements, which directly pressures operating profit and margin. Meanwhile, GE faces cost overrun risks on large-scale industrial projects, particularly in its Power and Renewable Energy divisions, where delays, coordination challenges with subcontractors, and supply chain issues can trigger penalties, liquidated damages, and unanticipated expenses. Both companies cite supply chain disruptions and inflation as key contributors to cost volatility, but RTX\u2019s fixed-price contract structure exposes it to more direct margin erosion, whereas GE\u2019s risks are tied to project execution complexity and consortium liabilities.",

      "question": "How does the use of pricing models for Level 2 fixed income investments by LMT compare to HON's use of pricing models for corporate bonds and government securities in terms of observable market data inputs and risk adjustments?",
      "answer": "LMT values its Level 2 fixed income investments using pricing models that rely on verifiable observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, and credit spreads, or through bids from brokers and quoted prices of similar securities. In contrast, HON uses pricing models for corporate bonds, mortgage/asset-backed securities, and government securities that also incorporate observable inputs but may include unobservable adjustments for risks like credit and liquidity. This indicates that while both companies use pricing models involving market data, HON's valuations may involve more subjective risk-based adjustments not always present in LMT's Level 2 valuations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LMT \u2192 Fixed Income Investments: LMT categorizes certain fixed income investments as Level 2 and values them using pricing models with observable market data like interest rates, yield curves, and credit spreads, or through broker bids and quoted prices of similar securities.",
        "Hop 2: Fixed Income Investments \u2192 Pricing Models: Pricing models are a valuation method applied to fixed income investments when they are categorized as Level 2, using a mix of observable and sometimes unobservable inputs depending on the entity's policy.",
        "Hop 3: Pricing Models \u2190 HON: HON uses pricing models for corporate bonds, mortgage/asset-backed securities, and government securities that include observable inputs but also incorporate unobservable adjustments for credit and liquidity risks."

      "answer": "RTX faces significant exposure to work complexity risks due to the need for accelerated inspections of the PW1100 GTF engines, which power the A320neo family, resulting in increased shop visits and financial uncertainty based on assumptions about timing, scope of work, and parts availability. General Dynamics similarly relies on assumptions and projections tied to labor productivity, work complexity, and material costs when accounting for their Aerospace segment contracts. Both companies are exposed to financial volatility when these assumptions change, particularly in relation to technical complexity and supplier performance, which can materially affect earnings and margins.",

        "Hop 1: RTX \u2192 Work Complexity: RTX's financial results are impacted by work complexity risks, especially the rare powder metal issue in PW1100 GTF engines, which has increased shop visits and requires assumptions about turnaround times, parts availability, and inspection scope.",

These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook, or credit ratings. Downgrades of our credit ratings may result, if we are unable to meet operating expectations and our cash flow expectations, or to the extent that we are unable to reduce our outstanding debt according to planned timeframes.\n\nWe use estimates in accounting for many of our programs, and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results. Accounting for longterm  contracts  and  related  assets  requires  estimates  and  judgments  related  to  our  progress  toward  completion  and  the  long-term  performance  on  the  contract. Significant judgments include potential risks associated with the ability and cost to achieve program schedule, including customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, and technical and other specific contract requirements including customer activity levels and variable consideration based upon that activity. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complex and subject to many variables. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and cost (such as estimates of variable consideration, including award fees and penalties), including with respect to: (1) labor productivity and availability; (2) the complex ity and scope of the work to be performed; (3) the availability and cost of materials including any impact from changing costs or inflation; (4) the length of time to complete the performance obligation; (5) ex ecution by our subcontractors; (6) the availability and timing of funding from our customer; (7) overhead cost rates; and (8) current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among other variables. Cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or ICIP agreements, required under certain contracts. In addition, in 2023 Pratt &amp; Whitney determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the PW1100 GTF fleet, which powers the A320neo family of aircraft. This determination and corresponding fleet actions have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, significant incremental shop visits necessary to perform inspections on PW1100 GTF engines as compared to estimates prior to this determination. Actual and future estimated aircraft on ground levels for the A320neo family of aircraft have therefore increased. The expected financial impact of the powder metal issue is based on historical experience and is subject to various assumptions and judgments, including, without limitation, the number and expected timing of shop visits, inspection results and scope of work to be performed, turnaround time, availability of parts, available capacity at overhaul facilities, and outcomes of negotiations with  impacted  customers,  and  these  assumptions  are  subject  to  variability.  Because  of  the  significance  of  management's  judgments  and  estimation  processes described above, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.\n\nSignificant changes in key estimates and assumptions with respect to our retirement plans, such as discount rate, expected return on plan assets (EROA), and other actuarial factors, could affect our future earnings, equity, and pension contributions. We must determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plans' expense or income, which involves significant judgment particularly with respect to our discount rate, EROA, and other actuarial assumptions. These assumptions are evaluated annually at December 31 and when significant events require a mid-year remeasurement. They may change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative, regulatory, and/or demographic experience or circumstances. Changes in our assumptions or actual experience that differs from these assumptions, as well as  management changes to retirement plans, could impact our pension and postretirement net periodic (income) expense, the plans' funded status, and/or the required cash contributions to such plans, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Our plan assets are invested in accordance with our investment management objectives and are subject to market volatility and other conditions.\n\nAdditional tax expense or exposures could affect our future profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and international jurisdictions. Significant  judgment  is  required  in  determining  our  worldwide  provision  for  income  tax es.  In  the  ordinary  course  of  our  business,  there  are  transactions  and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance, and fluctuations in taxable income could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax  assets and deferred tax  liabilities, as well as our income tax expense and tax payments. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to examinations by various tax authorities. In addition to ongoing examinations, there could be additional examinations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing examinations could be expanded. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, changes in the geographic mix of our sales could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense and profitability. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional examinations, proceedings, and contingencies will arise from time to time. Our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity could be negatively impacted by any of the above factors, the outcome of any one of which cannot be predicted with certainty.",

Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards and/or potentially required sustainability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, is costly and technologically challenging. These  challenges  are  particularly  significant  with  newer  aircraft  programs.  Any  failure  of  any  Boeing  aircraft  to  satisfy  performance  or  reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower rev enues.\n\nChanges  in  levels  of  U.S.  government  defense  spending  or  acquisition  priorities,  as  well  as  significant  delays  in  U.S.  government appropriations, could negatively impact our business, financial position and results of operations.\n\nWe derive a substantial portion of our rev enue from the U.S. gov ernment, primarily from defense related programs with the United States Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) and contracts with other gov ernment agencies, including NASA. Lev els of U.S. defense spending are v ery difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such as the ev olv ing nature of the national security threat env ironment, U.S. national security strategy, U.S. foreign policy,  the  domestic  political  env ironment,  macroeconomic  conditions  and  the  ability  of  the  U.S.  gov ernment  to  enact  relev ant  legislation  such  as authorization and appropriations bills. The gov ernment may also constrain discretionary spending by instituting enforceable spending caps.\n\nThe  timeliness  of  annual  appropriations  for  U.S.  gov ernment  departments  and  agencies  remains  a  recurrent  risk.  Congress  may  fund  gov ernment departments  and  agencies  with  one  or  more  continuing  resolutions,  which  could  delay  new  programs  or  competitions  and/or  negativ ely  impact  the execution of certain program activ ities. A lapse in appropriations for gov ernment departments or agencies would result in a full or partial gov ernment shutdown,  which  could  impact  our  operations.  In  the  ev ent  of  a  prolonged  shutdown,  requirements  to  furlough  employees  in  the  U.S.  DoD,  the Department of Transportation, including the FAA, or other gov ernment agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to deliv er commercial airplanes or perform work on existing contracts, delays in the certification of new aircraft or otherwise impact our operations, negativ ely impact future orders, and/or cause other disruptions or delays. There is uncertainty regarding which gov ernment functions would shut down or continue operations during a lapse in appropriations, and corresponding uncertainty regarding the extent or magnitude of potential impacts to our operations. For additional information  on  U.S.  gov ernment  appropriations  and  budgets,  see  'Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of Operations - Additional Considerations - U.S. Gov ernment Funding' on page 31 of this Form 10-K.\n\nIn  addition, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to future acquisition priorities and program-lev el appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies (including NASA), including changes to national security and defense priorities, and tension between modernization inv estments, sustainment inv estments, and inv estments in new technologies or emergent capabilities. Future inv estment priority changes or budget cuts, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs or future program opportunities. Any of these impacts could hav e a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nAs a result of the significant  ongoing  uncertainty  with  respect  to  both  U.S.  defense  spending  and  the  ev olv ing  nature  of  the  national  security  threat environment, we also expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize affordability, innov ation, cybersecurity and deliv ery of technical data and software in its procurement processes, including the implementation of cybersecurity compliance requirements on the Defense Industrial Base, for which the supply chain may not be fully prepared. If we and our suppliers are unable to adjust to these changing acquisition priorities and policies, our rev enues and market share could be impacted.",

      "question": "How does the ownership structure of UPS's Class A shares, particularly through trusts, compare to LMT's reliance on trusts for funding pension obligations, given the specific roles these trusts play in each company's financial framework?",
      "answer": "UPS's Class A shares are primarily held by employees, retirees, trusts, and descendants of the company's founders, with 4.6 billion Class A shares authorized as of December 31, 2021. These shares carry significant voting power (10 votes per share) and are convertible into publicly traded Class B shares. Trusts play a key role in holding these shares, which influences corporate governance. In contrast, LMT utilizes trusts to fund obligations for defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans, with $872 million in trust assets as of December 31, 2021. These trusts are used to ensure future benefit payments and are legally diversified to potentially cover other obligations. Thus, while UPS uses trusts as part of its equity ownership and governance structure, LMT uses trusts as a financial mechanism to secure employee benefits.",

      "answer": "GE uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach as part of its annual goodwill impairment testing, relying on cash flow forecasts, terminal value assumptions, and discount rates to estimate fair value. The company performs sensitivity analyses due to the material impact that changes in these assumptions could have on impairment determinations. Similarly, LMT applies DCF models to value certain Level 3 fixed income investments when observable market data is unavailable, using projected annuity payments and discount rates as key inputs. Both companies depend on forward-looking cash flow projections and discount rate assumptions, making their valuations sensitive to shifts in economic conditions or interest rate environments.

          "chunk_text": "REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG -TERM SERVICES AG REEMENTS. We enter into long-term services agreements with our customers, predominantly within the CES segment, that require us to maintain the customers' assets over the contract terms, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. Contract modifications that extend or revise contracts are not uncommon. We recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. This requires us to make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the current contract term as well as the costs to perform required maintenance services.\n\nOur rights to consideration for these arrangements are generally based on the utilization of the asset (e.g., per hour of usage) and contractual payment terms are based on either periodic billing schedules or upon the occurrence of a maintenance event, such as an overhaul. A s a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenue of a contract is estimating how customers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. The estimate of utilization, which can change over the contract life, impacts both the amount of customer payments we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract costs. Customers' asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhauls and other service events over the life of the contract. We generally use a combination of both historical utilization trends as well as forward-looking information such as market conditions and potential asset retirements in developing our revenue estimates.\n\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul events, including the frequency of maintenance events and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the maintenance. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.\n\nWe routinely review estimates and revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. Changes in estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis with an adjustment to revenue in the current period. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. Contract modifications that change the rights and obligations, as well as the nature, timing and extent of future cash flows, are evaluated for potential price concessions, contract asset impairments and significant financing to determine if adjustments of earnings are required before effectively accounting for a modified contract as a new contract.\n\nWe regularly assess expected billings adjustments and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and fleet management strategies through close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions may affect a long-term services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings.\n\nOn December 31, 2024, our long-term service agreements net liability balance of $6.6 billion represents approximately 4.1% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $162 billion. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 18.4% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. Revisions to our estimates of future billings or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage point would increase or decrease the long-term service agreements balance by $0.4 billion. Billings collected on these contracts were $8.6 billion and $8.1 billion during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Notes 1 and 8 for further information.\n\nNONRECURRING ENGINEERING  COSTS. We incur contract fulfillment costs for engineering and development of products directly related to existing or anticipated contracts with customers, primarily in our Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies segment. Contract fulfillment costs are capitalized to the extent recoverable from the customer contract, and subsequently amortized as the products are delivered to the customer. We periodically assess the recoverability of capitalized contract fulfillment costs, which requires significant judgement. Specifically, we estimate program volumes, contract revenue based on negotiated prices, and product costs based on input costs, inflation and productivity. See Note 8 for further information.\n\nIMPAIRMENT OF G OODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIED INTANG IBLE ASSETS . Goodwill is subject to annual, or more frequent, if necessary, impairment testing. In the impairment test, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions, or a market approach, when available and appropriate, utilizing market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, or both. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, and changes to those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analyses on key estimates and assumptions. Once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired. In the fourth quarter of each y ear, we perform our annual impairment test. See Note 7 for further information.\n\nWe review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. To determine fair value, we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate. See Notes 1 and 7 for further information.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 17",

      "question": "How do BA's and GD's approaches to using NAV as a practical expedient differ, and what does this reveal about their valuation complexity and disclosure practices?",
      "answer": "BA applies NAV as a practical expedient for valuing private equity, private debt, real estate, and hedge fund investments, which are primarily calculated by fund managers or third-party administrators. These valuations are based on inputs such as cost, discounted cash flows, and market-based comparable data, with adjustments made for subsequent cash flows and significant events, particularly for investments reported on a one-quarter lag. GD, on the other hand, uses NAV for its Level 1 and Level 2 assets, including commingled equity and fixed-income funds, which are actively traded or based on observable market inputs. GD also notes that certain NAV-based investments are redeemable monthly or quarterly with up to a 90-day notice period. The key difference lies in the nature of the assets: BA deals with more complex, illiquid private market investments requiring extensive adjustments, whereas GD relies on NAV for more liquid or observable fund structures. This distinction reveals that BA faces greater valuation complexity and must provide more nuanced disclosures around adjustments and timing lags, while GD's NAV-based assets are more standardized and transparent in reporting.",

Exchange-traded deriv ativ e positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily v ariation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receiv ables portion of the table.\n\nCash equivalents and other short-term inv estments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingled fund (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equiv alents. All inv estments in this cash v ehicle are v alued daily using a market approach with inputs that include quoted market prices for similar instruments. In the ev ent a market price is not av ailable for instruments with an original maturity of one year or less, amortized cost is used as a proxy for fair v alue. Common and preferred stock equity securities are primarily v alued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments.\n\nPriv ate equity and priv ate debt NAV v aluations are based on the v aluation of the underlying inv estments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those inv estments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs), we use NAVs adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant ev ents.\n\nReal estate and real asset NAVs are based on the v aluation of the underlying inv estments, which include inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. For those inv estments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily LPs), NAVs are adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant ev ents. Publicly traded infrastructure stocks are v alued using a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. Exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily v ariation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receiv ables portion of the table.\n\nHedge fund NAVs are generally based on the v aluation of the underlying inv estments. This is primarily done by applying a market or income v aluation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument held.\n\nInv estments in priv ate equity, priv ate debt, real estate, real assets and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the General Partner, fund manager or third-party administrator. Additionally, some inv estments in fixed income and equity are made v ia commingled v ehicles and are v alued in a similar  fashion.  Pension  assets  inv ested  in  commingled  and  LP  structures  rely  on  the  NAV  of  these  inv estments  as  the  practical  expedient  for  the valuations.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

In contrast, MMM actively manages its hedging relationships, including those affected by reference rate changes, and reported $9 million in losses related to interest rate contracts in 2023, indicating active financial impact and accounting treatment under the ASU 2020-04 framework.

New optional expedients allow derivative instruments impacted by changes in the interest rate used for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment to qualify for certain optional relief. The amendments in ASU 2022-06 extend the sunset date of the reference rate reform optional expedients and exceptions to December 31, 2024. | Effective for contract modifications made between March 12, 2020 and December 31, 2024. | The guidance has reduced the operational and financial impacts of contract modifications that replace a reference rate, such as London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR'), affected by reference rate reform.

      "answer": "UNP's pension plan investments in retail properties are held indirectly through real estate funds, which are valued using net asset value (NAV) derived primarily from property appraisals of the underlying assets. Real estate funds generally invest in assets like retail properties, and their fair value is calculated using NAV as pricing inputs are not readily observable. UNP specifically records the fair value of its real estate fund investments using the NAV for each investment, which incorporates appraisal-based valuations of properties such as retail locations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UNP \u2192 Real Estate Funds: UNP's pension plan holds real estate investments through private real estate funds, and these are valued using net asset value (NAV) derived from property appraisals.",

        "Hop 3: Retail Properties \u2190 BA: BA's real estate investments include retail properties, though this connection is general and does not imply a direct link to UNP\u2019s holdings; however, it confirms the relevance of retail properties in real estate fund strategies."

T he following is a description of the v aluation methodologies used for the inv estments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the v aluation hierarchy.\n\nFederal Government Securities - Federal Gov ernment Securities consist of bills, notes, bonds, and other fixed income securities issued directly by the  U.S.  T reasury  or  by  gov ernment-sponsored  enterprises.  T hese  assets  are  v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by independent pricing sources. Federal Gov ernment Securities are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nBonds and Debentures -  Bonds  and  debentures  consist  of  debt  securities  issued  by  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  corporations  as  well  as  state  and  local governments.  These assets are v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by  independent  pricing  sources.  Corporate,  state,  and municipal bonds and debentures are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nCorporate Stock - This inv estment category consists of common and preferred stock issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations. Most common shares are traded activ ely on exchanges and price quotes for these shares are readily av ailable. Common stock is classified as a Lev el 1 inv estment. Preferred shares included in this category are v alued using a bid ev aluation process with bid data prov ided by independent pricing sources. Preferred stock is classified as a Lev el 2 inv estment.\n\nVenture Capital and Buyout Partnerships - This inv estment category is comprised of interests in limited partnerships that inv est primarily in priv atelyheld companies. Due to the priv ate nature of the partnership inv estments, pricing inputs are not readily observ able. Asset v aluations are dev eloped by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These v aluations are based on the application of public market multiples to priv ate company cash flows, market transactions that prov ide v aluation information for comparable companies, and other methods. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using each partnership's net asset v alue (NAV).\n\nReal Estate Funds -  T he  plan's  real  estate  inv estments  are  primarily  interests  in  priv ate  real  estate  inv estment  trusts,  partnerships,  limited  liability companies, and similar structures. Valuations for the holdings in this category are not based on readily observ able inputs and are primarily deriv ed from property appraisals. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using the NAV for each inv estment.\n\nCollective  Trust  and  Other  Funds -  Collectiv e  trust  and  other  funds  are  comprised  of  shares  or  units  in  commingled  funds  and  limited  liability companies that are not publicly traded. The underlying assets in these entities (global stock funds and short-term inv estment funds) are publicly traded on exchanges and price quotes for the assets held by these funds are readily av ailable.

      "question": "How does the $2.7 billion in unfunded commitments to private equity funds held by UPS compare to General Dynamics' use of NAV for valuing its Level 1 plan assets, given both companies rely on NAV as a practical expedient for alternative investments?",
      "answer": "UPS reports $2.7 billion in unfunded commitments to private equity and similar funds as of December 31, 2024, with contributions expected over 3 to 6 years. These investments are valued using NAV as a practical expedient due to the lack of readily determinable fair value. Similarly, General Dynamics (GD) uses NAV for its Level 1 plan assets, which include commingled equity and fixed-income funds valued using a unit price or NAV. Both companies rely on NAV for valuation, but UPS's private equity commitments carry longer redemption restrictions (10\u201315 year terms), whereas GD's NAV-based assets are generally redeemable monthly or quarterly. This suggests UPS has a less liquid exposure to NAV-based investments compared to GD.",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules.

      "question": "How might the potential termination of the USPS contract with FedEx Express in 2024 and the associated revenue risk compare to Boeing's exposure from U.S. government contract modifications, given both companies' disclosures about the financial impacts of such events?",
      "answer": "The potential termination of the USPS contract with FedEx Express, which expires in September 2024, poses a direct revenue risk to FedEx, particularly since the USPS is the largest customer of FedEx Express, contributing significantly to its domestic air transportation services for First Class Mail, Priority Mail Express, and international delivery. FedEx explicitly states that a decision by the USPS to terminate or not renew this contract would negatively impact its profitability. Similarly, Boeing faces exposure from U.S. government contracts that may be modified, curtailed, or terminated at the government\u2019s convenience or due to performance issues, which could have a material adverse effect on Boeing\u2019s financial position and cash flows. Both companies disclose that their financial performance is materially tied to the continuation and stability of these contracts, with FedEx highlighting the negative impact already seen in 2022 from USPS's strategic changes and Boeing noting that contract modifications could significantly affect reported results, such as the $402 million in additional losses recorded on the KC-46A Tanker contract in 2021.",

FedEx is one of the most widely recognized, trusted, and respected brands in the world, and the FedEx brand is one of our most important and valuable assets. In addition, we have a strong reputation among customers, team members, and the general public for high standards of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethics. The FedEx brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sales and marketing and recruitment tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our team members or others with whom we do business, such as customer service mishaps, accidents, catastrophes, or incidents involving aircraft, vehicles, or facilities operated by us; low service or safety levels; data breaches or technology infrastructure disruptions; noncompliance with laws; the shipment of certain items pursuant to our obligation as a common carrier operating under federal law; our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, or marketing programs; or our executive compensation practices could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. With the increase in the use of social media outlets such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly without context, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. Further, our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation with certain groups, including our customers and team members. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and/or create difficulties in retaining and recruiting employee talent, and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.\n\nChanges in the business or financial soundness of the USPS, including strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air network of FedEx Express, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

See 'Item 1. Business' of this Annual Report under 'FedEx Express Segment' for more information.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the USPS. Additionally, the USPS continues to experience budgetary uncertainty as well as increased political debate regarding potential privatization or restructuring of its operations. The USPS is currently implementing strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air networks of FedEx Express and other transportation providers, which negatively impacted our results of operations in 2022. The difficulties discussed above or additional changes in the USPS's business, including its ability to access capital or any structural changes to its operations, network, volume levels, service offerings, service commitments, or pricing, could have additional negative impacts on our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, a decision by the USPS to terminate early or not renew its contract with FedEx Express for domestic services, which expires in September 2024, would negatively impact our profitability.\n\nWe face intense competition. The transportation and business services markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. Some of our competitors have more financial resources and competitive advantages than we do, appear willing to operate at little or no margin to gain market share, or they are owned, controlled, or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to raise capital more easily. We also compete with regional transportation providers that operate smaller and less capital-intensive transportation networks and startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, which could in turn reduce our revenues and market share. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. See 'Item 1.

The U.S. government contracting party  may  modify,  curtail  or  terminate  its  contracts  and  subcontracts  with  us,  without  prior  notice  and  either  at  its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such  as  'continuing  resolutions'  rather  than  full-year  appropriations.  Any  loss  or  anticipated  loss  or  reduction  of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable  under  U.S.  government  contracts. U.S.  government  agencies,  including  the  Defense  Contract  Audit Agency  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency,  routinely  audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.\n\n## We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.\n\nOur BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 68% and 69% of their 2021 revenues from fixed-price contracts.  While  fixed-price  contracts  enable  us  to  benefit  from  performance  improvements,  cost  reductions  and efficiencies,  they  also  subject  us  to  the  risk  of  reduced  margins  or  incurring  losses  if  we  are  unable  to  achieve estimated costs and revenues. In addition, increased compliance costs and costs due to loss of productivity due to COVID-19 may not be reimbursed. If  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  price,  we  recognize  reach-forward losses  which  can  significantly  affect  our  reported  results.  For  example  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  BDS  recorded additional losses of $402 million on the KC-46A Tanker contract reflecting continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer's requirements definition has evolved. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the  process  of  estimating  costs  and  revenues  on  fixed-price  contracts  inherently  risky.  Fixed-price  contracts  often contain  price  incentives  and  penalties  tied  to  performance,  which  can  be  difficult  to  estimate  and  have  significant impacts  on  margins.  In  addition,  some  of  our  contracts  have  specific  provisions  relating  to  cost,  schedule  and performance.\n\nFixed-price  development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  Examples  of  significant  BDS  fixed-price  development  contracts include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military satellites.",

      "answer": "EMR's foreign currency liabilities decreased from $22 billion in 2023 to $20 billion in 2024, a $2 billion reduction, while LMT maintained $7.5 billion in outstanding foreign currency hedges at the end of 2024. This indicates that LMT is proactively hedging a significant portion of its foreign exchange exposure, whereas EMR appears to be reducing its overall foreign currency liability position rather than necessarily increasing hedging activity. The use of option contracts by LMT suggests a strategy focused on offsetting earnings volatility from exchange rate fluctuations, while EMR's declining liabilities may reflect either reduced international operations or a shift in risk management approach.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nWe maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources.\n\nOur main exposures to market risk relate to interest rates, foreign currency ex change rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fix ed-rate long-term debt and commercial paper, if issued. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $20.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and the outstanding principal amount of debt, including short-term and long-term debt, was $21.6 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.3 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2024.\n\nWe use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates.  We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to minimize fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Norwegian kroner and the Polish zloty. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate  changes  primarily  through  our  borrowing  activities.  For  fix ed  rate  borrowings,  we  may  use  variable  interest  rate  swaps,  effectively  converting  fix ed  rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to minimize certain economic exposures.\n\nThe classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are not highly effective, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps was $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $7.5 billion and $6.5 billion. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see 'Note 15 - Fair V alue Measurements' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter  into  foreign  currency  contracts  to  hedge  foreign  currency  ex posure  on  underlying  transactions,  we  believe  that  any  movement  on  our  foreign  currency contracts would be offset by movement on the underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.\n\nWe evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across many banks. We regularly monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nWe maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2024, investments in the trust totaled $1.8 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fix ed-income securities that are ex posed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2024.",

The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .\n\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value.\n\n- U.S. and Foreign Government Securities : U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities and municipal securities. Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Corporate Debt Instruments : Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Common Stock : Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date.\n- Collective Investment Funds : Collective investment funds consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index. They are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective collective investment funds. The underlying assets are valued based on the net asset value ('NAV'), which is provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCash Flows: Altria makes contributions to the pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax deductible and pays benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. Currently, Altria anticipates making employer contributions to its pension and postretirement plans of up to approximately $30 million for each in 2022. However, the foregoing estimates of 2022 contributions to the pension and postretirement plans are subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, changes in interest rates, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return for each respective plan.\n\nEstimated future benefit payments at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "GE holds $31.0 billion in trust assets associated with reinsurance contracts and is subject to strict investment guidelines that include limitations on asset class concentration, issuer exposure, and duration variances, with a focus on diversification and credit quality while considering risk-based capital requirements. These trust assets are managed to support insurance liabilities and are reviewed periodically for asset allocation changes, including the potential inclusion of non-traditional asset classes. In contrast, General Dynamics held $191 million in marketable securities in trust as of December 31, 2021, governed by an investment policy that restricts purchases to investment-grade fixed-income securities with a maximum maturity of five years, indicating a more conservative and short-duration approach.

We reinsure approximately 27,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 54. These structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-thanaverage life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins). Unlike long- term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nOur life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. As of December 31, 2021, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance blocks, we reinsure approximately $70 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.7 million policies with an average attained age of 60. In 2021, our incurred claims were approximately $0.6 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $50,000. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20 and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20-year level term policies, which represent approximately 25% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2024 as the policies reach the end of their 20-year level premium period.\n\nInvestment portfolio and other adjustments. Our insurance liabilities and annuity benefits are primarily supported by investment securities of $41.6 billion and $42.0 billion and commercial mortgage loans of $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, we expect to purchase approximately $5.5 billion of new assets through 2024 in conjunction with expected capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2022, pending completion of our December 31, 2021 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. Our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and comprise mainly investment-grade debt securities. The portfolio includes $6.7 billion of net unrealized gains that are recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of applicable taxes and other adjustments as of December 31, 2021.\n\nIn calculating our future policy benefit reserves, we are required to consider the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investment securities supporting our insurance contracts as if those unrealized amounts were realized. To the extent that the realization of gains would result in a premium deficiency, an adjustment is recorded to increase future policy benefit reserves with an after-tax offset to Accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2021, $3.4 billion of net unrealized gains on our investment securities required a related increase to future policy benefit reserves. This adjustment decreased from $8.2 billion in 2020 to $3.4 billion in 2021 primarily from the higher margin resulting from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities. See Note 3 for further information about our investment securities.\n\nWe manage the investments in our run-off insurance operations under strict investment guidelines, including limitations on asset class concentration, single issuer exposures, asset-liability duration variances, and other factors to meet credit quality, yield, liquidity and diversification requirements associated with servicing our insurance liabilities under reasonable circumstances. This process includes consideration of various asset allocation strategies and incorporates information from several external investment advisors to improve our investment yield subject to maintaining our ability to satisfy insurance liabilities when due, as well as considering our risk-based capital requirements, regulatory constraints, and tolerance for surplus volatility. With the expected capital contributions through 2024, we intend to further diversify our portfolio, including with non-traditional asset classes such as private equity, senior secured loans and infrastructure debt, among others. Asset allocation planning is a dynamic process that considers changes in market conditions, risk appetite, liquidity needs and other factors which are reviewed on a periodic basis by our investment team. Investing in these assets exposes us to both credit risk (i.e., debtor's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest), interest rate risk (i.e., market price, cash flow variability, and reinvestment risk due to changes in market interest rates) and equity risk (i.e., the risk arising from",

Assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contracts and trust agreements. Some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of ERAC or UFLIC which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates and benefit utilization rates); morbidity improvement (i.e., assumed rate of improvement in morbidity in the future); mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force); anticipated premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, including actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2030, on long-term care insurance policies; and interest rates. Assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.\n\nClaim reserves . Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. Key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. Claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.\n\nReinsurance recoverables . We cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies, and record receivables for estimated recoveries as we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholders or cedents. These receivables are estimated in a manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves. Reserves ceded to reinsurers, net of allowance, were $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in the caption All other assets in our Statement of Financial Position.\n\nPremium Deficiency Testing . We annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. The premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. A comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. Premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nThe primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include:\n\nMorbidity . Morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. For long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last). Prior to 2017, premium deficiency assumptions considered the risk of anti-selection by including issue age adjustments to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long-term care policies issued to younger individuals would exhibit lower expected incidences and claim costs than those issued to older policyholders. Recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curves indicated issue age differences had minimal impact on claim cost projections, and, accordingly, beginning in 2017, issue age adjustments were eliminated in developing morbidity assumptions. Higher morbidity increases, while lower morbidity decreases, the present value of expected future benefit payments.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, licenses, patents, customer lists, non-compete agreements and franchise rights are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from 2 to 21 years. Capitalized software is generally amortized over 7 years. Finite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment as part of asset groups whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n## Assets Held for Sale\n\nWe classify long-lived assets or disposal groups as held for sale in the period when all of the following conditions have been met:\n\n- we have approved and committed to a plan to sell the assets or disposal group;\n- the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition;\n- an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the sale have been initiated;\n- the sale of the asset or disposal group is probable and expected to be completed within one year;\n- the asset or disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and\n- it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nWe initially measure a long-lived asset or disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell and recognize any loss in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. G ains are not recognized until the date of sale. We cease depreciation and amortization of a long-lived asset, or assets within a disposal group, upon their designation as held for sale and subsequently assess fair value less any costs to sell at each reporting date until the asset or disposal group is no longer classified as held for sale.\n\n## Supplier Finance Programs\n\nAs part of our working capital management, certain financial institutions offer a Supply Chain Finance (\"SCF\") program to certain of our suppliers. We agree to commercial terms with our suppliers, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. Suppliers issue invoices to us based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. If they participate in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, to sell to the financial institutions. Our suppliers' voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No guarantees are provided by us under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the SCF program.\n\nAmounts due to our suppliers that participate in the SCF program are included in Accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, suppliers sold $515 and $504 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations to participating institutions.

This ASU requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

          "chunk_text": "RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, primarily investment securities and derivatives, fair v alue is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability  in an orderly  transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. See Note 21 for further information.\n\nDebt Securities. When available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of debt securities which are included in Level 1. For our remaining debt securities, we obtain pricing information from an independent pricing vendor. The inputs and assumptions to the pricing vendor's models are derived from market observable sources including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other marketrelated data. These investments are included in Level 2. Our pricing vendors may also provide us with valuations that are based on significant unobservable inputs, and in those circumstances, we classify the investment securities in Level 3.\n\nAnnually, we conduct reviews of our primary pricing vendor to validate that the inputs used in that vendor's pricing process are deemed to be market observable as defined in the standard. We believe that the prices received from our pricing vendor are representative of prices that would be received to sell the assets at the measurement date (exit prices) and are classified appropriately in the hierarchy. We use non-binding broker quotes and other third-party pricing services as our primary basis for valuation when there is limited, or no, relevant market activity for a specific instrument or for other instruments that share similar characteristics. Debt securities priced in this manner are included in Level 3.\n\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values . These publicly traded equity securities are valued using quoted prices and are included in Level 1.\n\nDerivatives. The majority of our derivatives are valued using internal models. The models maximize the use of market observable inputs including interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 2 primarily represent interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency and commodity forward and option contracts.\n\nInvestments in private equity, real estate and collective funds held within our pension plans or run-off insurance operations . M ost inv estments are generally valued using the net asset value (NA V ) per share as a practical expedient for fair value provided certain criteria are met. The NA V s are determined based on the fair v alues of the underly ing inv estments in the funds. Inv estments that are measured at fair value using the NA V  practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair v alue hierarchy . Inv estments classified within Lev el 3 primarily  relate to real estate and priv ate equities which are v alued using unobserv able inputs, primarily by discounting expected future cash flows, using comparative market multiples, third-party pricing sources, or a combination of these approaches as appropriate. See Notes 3 and 13 for further information.\n\nNONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets may include loans and longliv ed assets reduced to fair value upon classification as held for sale, impaired loans based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, impaired equity securities without readily determinable fair value, equity method investments and long-lived assets and remeasured retained investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in the deconsolidation of that subsidiary and retention of a noncontrolling stake in the entity. Assets written down to fair value when impaired and retained investments are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.\n\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair value and Associated companies. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value and associated companies are valued using market observable data such as transaction prices when available. When market observable data is unavailable, investments are valued using either a discounted cash flow model, comparative market multiples, third-party pricing sources or a combination of these approaches as appropriate. These investments are generally included in Level 3.\n\nLong-lived Assets . Fair v alues of long-liv ed assets are primarily  deriv ed internally  and are based on observed sales transactions for similar assets or discounted cash flow estimates. In other instances for which we do not have comparable observed sales transaction data, collateral values are developed internally and corroborated by external appraisal information. A djustments to third-party valuations may be performed in circumstances where market comparables are not specific to the attributes of the specific collateral or appraisal information may not be reflective of current market conditions due to the passage of time and the occurrence of market events since receipt of the information.\n\nADOPTIONS OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50) Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations . This guidance requires disclosures for supply chain finance programs using a retrospective approach, except for the annual roll-forward which is applicable prospectively in the period beginning January 1, 2024. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn 2024, we adopted ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , on a retrospective basis. The amendments are intended to increase reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.

          "chunk_text": "## HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts)\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (T opic 405): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs. The new standard requires annual disclosure of the key terms of the program, a description of where in the financial statements amounts outstanding under the program are presented, a rollforward of such amounts, and interim disclosure of amounts outstanding as of the end of each period. The guidance does not affect recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of supplier finance programs. The A SU was effective on January 1, 2023, except for the rollforward, which was effective on January 1, 2024. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2023, with the exception of the rollforward adopted on January 1, 2024. The adoption of this standard does not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nResearch and development costs for projects are expensed as incurred, unless these costs relate to contracts with customers where the Company receives reimbursements. Costs related to contracts with customers for customer-sponsored research and development projects are included as a contract cost and included in Cost of products and services sold when revenue from such contracts is recognized, consistent with the Company's sales recognition policies.\n\n## CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less.\n\n## INVENTORIES\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Carrying value adjustments for inventory obsolescence is equal to the difference between the cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Items capable of being sold, including as spare parts, are classified as finished goods.\n\n## PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty ,  plant  and  equipment  are  recorded  at  cost,  including  any   asset  retirement  obligations,  less  accumulated  depreciation.  For  financial  reporting,  the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and three to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability , the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding asset's useful life.\n\n## GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nThe Company recognizes goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances in conjunction with business combinations, with amounts being recorded at their  respective  fair  v alues  upon  the  closing  of  a  transaction.  Subsequent  to  the  closing  of  a  business  combination,  the  Company  evaluates  and  books adjustments, as applicable, to the preliminary amounts recorded over the relevant measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or if a triggering event occurs or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.  This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter and determined there was no impairment as of that date. The Company is not aware of any additional triggering events.\n\n## DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nThe Company recognizes definite-lived intangible asset balances in conjunction with business combinations, with amounts being recorded at their respective fair values upon the closing of a transaction. Subsequent to the closing of a business combination, the Company evaluates and books adjustments, as applicable, to the preliminary amounts recorded over the relevant measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n\nDefinite-liv ed  intangible  assets  consist  of  customer  relationships,  patents  and  technology ,  trademarks,  and  other  intangibles  and  are  amortized  over  their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to 20 years.\n\n58 Honeywell International Inc.",

This ASU requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, licenses, patents, customer lists, non-compete agreements and franchise rights are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from 2 to 21 years. Capitalized software is generally amortized over 7 years. Finite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment as part of asset groups whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n## Assets Held for Sale\n\nWe classify long-lived assets or disposal groups as held for sale in the period when all of the following conditions have been met:\n\n- we have approved and committed to a plan to sell the assets or disposal group;\n- the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition;\n- an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the sale have been initiated;\n- the sale of the asset or disposal group is probable and expected to be completed within one year;\n- the asset or disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and\n- it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nWe initially measure a long-lived asset or disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell and recognize any loss in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. G ains are not recognized until the date of sale. We cease depreciation and amortization of a long-lived asset, or assets within a disposal group, upon their designation as held for sale and subsequently assess fair value less any costs to sell at each reporting date until the asset or disposal group is no longer classified as held for sale.\n\n## Supplier Finance Programs\n\nAs part of our working capital management, certain financial institutions offer a Supply Chain Finance (\"SCF\") program to certain of our suppliers. We agree to commercial terms with our suppliers, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. Suppliers issue invoices to us based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. If they participate in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, to sell to the financial institutions. Our suppliers' voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No guarantees are provided by us under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the SCF program.\n\nAmounts due to our suppliers that participate in the SCF program are included in Accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, suppliers sold $515 and $504 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations to participating institutions. A rollforward of obligations confirmed and paid during the year is presented below (dollars in millions):\n\n",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .\n\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value.\n\n- U.S. and Foreign Government Securities : U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities and municipal securities. Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Corporate Debt Instruments : Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Common Stock : Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date.\n- Collective Investment Funds : Collective investment funds consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index. They are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective collective investment funds. The underlying assets are valued based on the net asset value ('NAV'), which is provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCash Flows: Altria makes contributions to the pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax deductible and pays benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. Currently, Altria anticipates making employer contributions to its pension and postretirement plans of up to approximately $30 million for each in 2022. However, the foregoing estimates of 2022 contributions to the pension and postretirement plans are subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, changes in interest rates, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return for each respective plan.\n\nEstimated future benefit payments at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "Both UPS and LMT rely on observable market data such as yield curves and interest rates in pricing models for valuing financial instruments. UPS uses these models for foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate derivatives, which are classified as Level 2 due to the use of market observable inputs. Similarly, LMT applies pricing models with verifiable observable market data like interest rates and credit spreads for Level 2 fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps. This shared methodology reflects a consistent industry practice for valuing complex financial instruments using reliable, external data sources when active exchange trading is not available.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS \u2192 Pricing Models: UPS utilizes over-the-counter derivatives valued using pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves and foreign exchange rates, resulting in Level 2 classification.",
        "Hop 2: Pricing Models \u2192 Fixed Income Investments: LMT applies pricing models using observable market data like interest rates and credit spreads to value fixed income investments, including swaps, which are categorized as Level 2.",
        "Hop 3: Fixed Income Investments \u2190 LMT: LMT invests in fixed income instruments and uses pricing models with observable inputs to determine fair value for Level 2 assets in its pension plan portfolio."

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin's retirement trust categorizes municipal bonds within Level 2 securities if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor, while Union Pacific explicitly states that municipal bonds are valued using a bid evaluation process with bid data provided by independent pricing sources. This indicates both companies rely on third-party pricing vendors for Level 2 municipal bond valuations, but Lockheed Martin allows for broader corroboration methods beyond just bid data.",

        "Hop 1: LMT \u2192 Level 2 Securities: Lockheed Martin discloses that securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor or investment manager.",

          "chunk_text": "## FEDEX CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\norganizational redesign was implemented in phases with full legal implementation effective June 1, 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability.\n\nFedEx is making progress with Network 2.0, as the company has implemented Network 2.0 optimization in more than 50 locations in the U.S. Contracted service providers will handle the pickup and delivery of packages in some locations while employee couriers will handle others.\n\nWe incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $582 million ($444 million, net of tax , or $1.77 per diluted share) in 2024 and $273 million ($209 million, net of tax , or $0.81 per diluted share) in 2023. The costs incurred in 2024 were primarily related to professional fees and severance, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. The costs incurred in 2023 were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in Russia, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express. We did not incur costs associated with our business optimization activities in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe related to the network integration of TNT Express. The plan affected approximately 5,000 employees in Europe across operational teams and back-office functions and was completed during 2023. We incurred costs of $36 million ($27 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) in 2023 and $278 million ($214 million, net of tax , or $0.80 per diluted share) in 2022 associated with our business realignment activities. These costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements. Payments under this program totaled approximately $118 million in 2023 and approximately $225 million in 2022. The cumulative pre-tax cost of our business realignment activities was approximately $430 million. We did not incur any costs related to business realignment activities in 2024.\n\nIn June 2024, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe as part of its ongoing measures to reduce structural costs. The plan will impact between 1,700 and 2,000 employees in Europe across back-office and commercial functions. The execution of the plan is subject to a consultation process that is expected to occur over an 18-month period in accordance with local country processes and regulations. We expect the pre-tax cost of the severance benefits and legal and professional fees to be provided under and related to the plan to range from $250 million to $375 million in cash ex penditures. These charges are expected to be incurred through fiscal 2026 and will be classified as business optimization ex penses.\n\nUSE OF ESTIMATES . The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include self-insurance accruals, retirement plan obligations, long-term incentive accruals, tax  liabilities, loss contingencies, litigation claims, impairment assessments on long-lived assets (including goodwill) that rely on projections of future cash flows, and purchase price allocations.\n\n## NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\n\nNew accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly affect our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements. We believe the following new accounting guidance is relevant to the readers of our financial statements.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires a buyer in a supplier finance program (e.g., reverse factoring) to disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program's nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. The amendments do not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. We adopted this standard effective June 1, 2023 (fiscal 2024). The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or internal controls. See Note 1 for further discussion about our supplier finance program obligations.",

          "chunk_text": "## (Dollars in Millions Except Per S hare Amounts)\n\nIn August 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-05, 'Business Combinations-Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement.' This ASU requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

Supplier Finance Program Obligations\n\nUnder supplier finance programs, 3M agrees to pay participating banks the stated amount of confirmed invoices from its designated suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices, generally within 90 days of the invoice date. 3M or the banks may terminate the agreements with advance notice. Separately, the banks may have arrangements with the suppliers that provide them the option to request early payment from the banks for invoices confirmed by 3M. 3M's outstanding balances of confirmed invoices in the programs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. These amounts are included within accounts payable on 3M's consolidated balance sheet. The activity in 2024 included approximately $1.5 billion of invoices confirmed and $1.5 billion of invoices paid and other adjustments.\n\n## NOTE 17. Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3M's financial position and performance.\n\nAdditional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:\n\n- Impact on other comprehensive income of non-derivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 9.\n- Fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 18.\n- Derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company's long-term debt are also described in Note 14.\n\nRefer to the section below titled Location on Statement of Income (Loss) and Impact of Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments for details on the location within the consolidated statements of income (loss) for amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow or fair value hedges (along with similar information relative to the hedged items) and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Additional information relative to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included below as applicable.\n\nCash Flow Hedges: For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts: The Company may enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of ex change rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The Company may de-designate a cash flow hedge if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable, if 3M determines that the hedge is no longer expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction, or in certain other circumstances. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income for de-designated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in the value of derivative instruments after de-designation are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments section below. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Interest Rate Contracts: The Company may use forward starting interest rate contracts and treasury rate lock contracts to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments on forecasted debt issuances.\n\nThe amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the gain/(loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had a balance of $15 million associated with the after-tax net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). This includes a remaining balance of $80 million (after-tax loss) related to forward starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock contracts terminated in 2019 concurrent with associated debt issuances, which is being amortized over the respective lives of the underlying notes. Based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, of the total after-tax net unrealized balance as of December 31, 2024, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $44 million after-tax  net unrealized gain over the nex t 12 months (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).",

Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin also anticipates no material impact from Pillar 2 on its effective tax rate or consolidated results, despite the framework's phased implementation starting in 2024 and 2025. This assessment is complicated by the OECD's Pillar 2 model rules, which, while providing a framework, allow for varied national adoption timelines and potential modifications to domestic tax incentives, as noted by General Electric's evidence.",

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin reported cumulative reach-forward losses of $270 million and $280 million on two fixed-price contracts as of December 31, 2023, with potential for additional losses if cost overruns continue. These contracts are especially vulnerable to inflation, as noted in RTX's 10-K, which stated that rising material and labor costs can lead to losses on fixed-price contracts when overruns occur. Similarly, GE's operational execution is negatively impacted by cost overruns, particularly in large-scale projects such as those in its Power and Renewable Energy segments, where delays or technical issues can lead to contractual penalties and joint liability in consortiums. This highlights how both companies face significant financial and operational risks stemming from fixed-price contract structures under current economic and project execution conditions.",

      "answer": "Honeywell's strategic investment in 4.2 million shares of Garrett's Series A Preferred Stock specifically excluded standard voting rights, aligning with AIG's disclosure that Series A Preferred Stock typically only carries voting rights in limited circumstances like dividend non-payments. This contrasts with General Dynamics' equity compensation programs, where restricted stock recipients receive both cash dividends and full voting rights during the restriction period, while RSU recipients receive dividend-equivalent units but are explicitly denied voting rights. The comparison reveals differing corporate philosophies regarding shareholder engagement through equity structures, with Honeywell accepting limited governance influence as an investor while General Dynamics bifurcates voting privileges based on equity instrument type.",

        "Hop 1: HON \u2192 Series A Preferred Stock: Honeywell invested in 4.2 million shares of Garrett's Series A Preferred Stock, accepting terms that excluded standard voting rights as part of its strategic investment approach.",

          "chunk_text": "## HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts)\n\nOn December 17, 2021, Garrett  announced  their  intention  to  effect  the  First  Partial  Redemption  on  December  28,  2021,  in  the amount  of  $211  million,  and  plan  to  effect  the  Second  Partial  Redemption  during  the  first  quarter  of  2022  for  a  corresponding payment of $200 million. On December 28, 2021, Garrett paid $211 million for the amount due as the First Partial Redemption.\n\nThe Company recorded the Series B Preferred Stock at fair value at the Effective Date. The Company believes the present value of the mandatory redemptions is an appropriate basis for determining the fair value of the Series B Preferred Stock. The Company's present value reflects amortized cost determined by the present value of the mandatory redemptions discounted at 7.25%, which is the rate reflected in the Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation. The discount amount will accrete into interest income over the mandatory redemption period. In addition to the Series B Preferred Stock, the Company subscribed for 4.2 million shares of Garrett's Series A Preferred Stock, which are convertible into Garrett's Common Stock if certain conditions are met. Prior to and following  Garrett's  emergence  from  bankruptcy,  the  Company  also  held  2.9  million  shares  of  Garrett's  Common  Stock.  As  of December 31, 2021, Short-term investments included $34 million and Investments and long-term receivables included $423 million for the Company's investments in Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock.\n\n## OTHER MATTERS\n\nThe Company is subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of the Company's business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters (including the matter described below). The Company recognizes liabilities for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company continually assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes in such matters,  as  well  as  potential  ranges  of  possible  losses  (taking  into  consideration  any  insurance  recoveries),  based  on  a  careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts.\n\nSuch matters include:\n\n- Petrobras and Unaoil - The Company continues to cooperate with investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  and  the  Brazilian  authorities  relating  to  the  Company's  use  of  third  parties  who previously worked for the Company's UOP business in Brazil in relation to Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras) in connection with a  project  awarded  in  2010.  The  investigations  focus  on  compliance  with  the  U.S.  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  similar Brazilian laws (the UOP Matters), and involve, among other things, document production and interviews with former and current management and employees. The DOJ and the SEC are also examining a matter involving a foreign subsidiary's prior contract with Unaoil S.A.M. in Algeria executed in 2011. The Company continues to be engaged in discussions with the authorities with respect to a potential comprehensive resolution of these matters.\n\nAs the discussions are both ongoing and at different stages with regards to each respective authority, there can be no assurance as  to  whether  the  Company  will  reach  a  resolution  with  such  authorities  or  as  to  the  potential  timing,  terms,  or  collateral consequences of any such resolution. As a result, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these UOP Matters or the potential impact on the Company. Based on available information to date, the Company estimates that a potential comprehensive resolution of these UOP Matters would result in a probable loss of at least $160 million, and the Company has recorded a charge in this amount in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations, and accrued a corresponding liability on the Consolidated Balance  Sheet. Amounts  payable  to  authorities  pursuant  to  any  potential  final  comprehensive  resolution  could  differ  from  the amount recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Based on available information to date, the Company does not expect that any such difference would be material with respect to the Company's consolidated financial position.\n\nGiven the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations, the Company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably  possible  losses  (or  a  range  of  possible  losses)  in  excess  of  current  accruals  for  such  matters.  Considering  the Company's past experience and existing accruals, the Company does not expect the outcome of such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.\n\n98 Honeywell International Inc.",

For stock options exercised, intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the market price on the date of exercise and the exercise price. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $62 in 2021, $57 in 2020 and $244 in 2019.\n\nRestricted Stock/RSUs. The fair value of restricted stock and RSUs equals the average of the high and low market prices of our common stock as listed on the NYSE on the date of grant. Grants of restricted stock are awards of shares of common stock. Participation units represent obligations that have a value derived from or related  to  the  value  of  our  common  stock. These  include  stock  appreciation  rights,  phantom  stock  units  and RSUs, and are payable in cash or common stock.\n\nRestricted  stock  and  RSUs  generally  vest  over  a  three-year  restriction  period  after  the  grant  date,  during which recipients  may  not  sell,  transfer,  pledge,  assign  or  otherwise  convey  their  restricted  shares  to  another party.  During  this  period,  restricted  stock  recipients  receive  cash  dividends  on  their  restricted  shares  and  are entitled to vote those shares, while RSU recipients receive dividend-equivalent units instead of cash dividends and are not entitled to vote their RSUs or dividend-equivalent units.",

      "question": "How does the exposure of Lockheed Martin's investments in private equity funds, measured at NAV, compare to UPS's reported valuation challenges with similar investments, given the role of NAV as a practical expedient in both companies' financial disclosures?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin reported $4,951 million invested in private equity funds measured at NAV as of December 31, 2023, while UPS disclosed that its U.S. pension and postretirement medical benefit plans held $9.9 billion in hedge fund, private debt, private equity, and real estate investments valued primarily based on estimated NAV. Both companies rely on NAV as a practical expedient for valuing investments without readily determinable fair values, as described in UPS's accounting policy. However, UPS highlights the subjectivity and audit complexity involved in estimating NAV due to the lack of active trading and reliance on fund managers' audited or unaudited financial reports, which could lead to potential valuation discrepancies over time.",

These hedges are designed to offset earnings and cash flow fluctuations from forecasted foreign currency transactions, as outlined in their hedging practices. Meanwhile, EMR reports $31 billion in foreign currency assets as of 2024, indicating a significant exposure to foreign exchange risk. The comparison suggests that while LMT proactively uses derivative instruments to mitigate FX volatility, EMR's larger asset base in foreign currencies may require a different risk management approach, potentially involving less hedging or a focus on natural offsets through liabilities. This contrast highlights differing strategies in handling foreign exchange risk between the two companies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nWe maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources.\n\nOur main exposures to market risk relate to interest rates, foreign currency ex change rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fix ed-rate long-term debt and commercial paper, if issued. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $20.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and the outstanding principal amount of debt, including short-term and long-term debt, was $21.6 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.3 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2024.\n\nWe use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates.  We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to minimize fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Norwegian kroner and the Polish zloty. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate  changes  primarily  through  our  borrowing  activities.  For  fix ed  rate  borrowings,  we  may  use  variable  interest  rate  swaps,  effectively  converting  fix ed  rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to minimize certain economic exposures.\n\nThe classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are not highly effective, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps was $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $7.5 billion and $6.5 billion. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see 'Note 15 - Fair V alue Measurements' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter  into  foreign  currency  contracts  to  hedge  foreign  currency  ex posure  on  underlying  transactions,  we  believe  that  any  movement  on  our  foreign  currency contracts would be offset by movement on the underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.\n\nWe evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across many banks. We regularly monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nWe maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2024, investments in the trust totaled $1.8 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fix ed-income securities that are ex posed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2024.",

The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million. The following table summarizes the effect of foreign ex change cash flow hedges on AOCI:\n\n",

      "answer": "Caterpillar is subject to ASU 2022-06, which defers the sunset date of ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, allowing companies more time to manage the effects of reference rate reform, particularly the discontinuation of LIBOR. FedEx, although also subject to ASU 2020-04, notes that as of May 31, 2024, there has been no material effect on its financial condition or operations from reference rate reform.

The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, with certain exceptions. ASU 2021-01 amends the scope of the recent reference rate reform guidance. New optional expedients allow derivative instruments impacted by changes in the interest rate used for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment to qualify for certain optional relief. The amendments in ASU 2022-06 extend the sunset date of the reference rate reform optional expedients and exceptions to December 31, 2024. | Effective for contract modifications made between March 12, 2020 and December 31, 2024. | The guidance has reduced the operational and financial impacts of contract modifications that replace a reference rate, such as London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR'), affected by reference rate reform. Contract modifications to replace reference rates affected by the reform occurred during 2021, 2022 and 2023.

Caterpillar, on the other hand, had Citibank, N.A. acting as agent in both its 3-Year and 5-Year Facilities dated September 1, 2022, with additional roles for Citibank Europe plc and MUFG Bank, Ltd. in local currency management. Both companies saw Citibank play a central role in structuring and managing credit facilities, but Caterpillar\u2019s agreements included more complex international components, while Boeing\u2019s amendment in 2022 was a singular update to its existing agreement.",

        "Hop 1: BA \u2192 Five Year Credit Agreement: Boeing entered into a Five-Year Credit Agreement in 2019, amended in 2022, with Citibank, N.A. as administrative agent and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as syndication agent.",
        "Hop 2: Five Year Credit Agreement \u2192 Citibank, N.A.: Citibank, N.A. serves as administrative agent in Boeing\u2019s credit agreement and as agent in Caterpillar\u2019s 3-Year and 5-Year Facilities, indicating a central role in syndicated credit structures.",
        "Hop 3: Citibank, N.A. \u2190 CAT: Caterpillar has multiple credit agreements with Citibank, N.A. as agent, including 3-Year and 5-Year Facilities dated September 1, 2022, with amendments in 2023, and localized currency arrangements involving Citibank Europe plc and MUFG Bank, Ltd."

The total carrying value of GE preferred stock at December 31, 2021 was $5,935 million and will increase to $5,940 million by the respective call dates through periodic accretion. Dividends on GE preferred stock are payable semiannually in June and December and accretion is recorded on a quarterly basis. Dividends on GE preferred stock totaled $237 million, including cash dividends of $220 million, $474 million, including cash dividends of $295 million, and $460 million, including cash dividends of $295 million, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. On January 21, 2021, the GE Series D preferred stock became callable and its dividends converted from 5% fixed rate to 3-month LIBOR plus 3.33%. As of the filing date of this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, the GE Series D preferred stock has not been called.\n\nGE has 50 million authorized shares of preferred stock ($1.00 par value), of which 5,939,875 shares are outstanding as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. GE's authorized common stock consists of 1,650 million shares having a par value of $0.01 each, with 1,462 million shares issued. To facilitate settlement of employee compensation programs, we repurchased shares of 0.5 million and 0.1 million, for a total of $35.8 million and $15.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests , presented within All other liabilities in our Statement of Financial Position, include common shares issued by our affiliates that are redeemable at the option of the holder of those interests and amounted to $148 million and $487 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease of $339 million was primarily due to a redeemable noncontrolling interest in our Aviation segment, which was converted into a mandatorily redeemable instrument and reclassified to All other current liabilities.\n\nNOTE 16. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. We grant stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units to employees under the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Grants made under all plans must be approved by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of GE's Board of Directors, which is composed entirely of independent directors. We record compensation expense for awards expected to vest over the vesting period. We estimate forfeitures based on experience and adjust expense to reflect actual forfeitures. When options are exercised, restricted stock units vest, and performance share awards are earned, we issue shares from treasury stock. Where applicable, the disclosures below have been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-8 reverse stock split effective July 30, 2021.\n\nStock options provide employees the opportunity to purchase GE shares in the future at the market price of our stock on the date the award is granted (the strike price). The options become exercisable over the vesting period, typically three years, and expire 10 years from the grant date if not exercised. Restricted stock units (RSU) provide an employee with the right to receive one share of GE stock when the restrictions lapse over the vesting period. Upon vesting, each RSU is converted into one share of GE common stock for each unit. Performance share units (PSU) and performance shares provide an employee with the right to receive shares of GE stock based upon achievement of certain performance or market metrics. Upon vesting, each PSU earned is converted into shares of GE common stock. We value stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, RSUs using market price on grant date, and PSUs and performance shares using market price on grant date and a Monte Carlo simulation as needed based on performance metrics.\n\n",

An Amended Complaint was filed on December 30, 2019, and on February 7, 2020, the  Company filed a Motion to Dismiss. On May 18, 2020, the Court denied the Motion to Dismiss. On December 7, 2021, the parties filed a Stipulation of Settlement (Settlement Agreement) and Plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement, which includes payment by Honeywell of $10 million to settle the claims in dispute. Honeywell continues to believe the claims lack merit and denies wrongdoing as well as any liability for the claims made against Honeywell in the action. The Settlement Agreement remains subject to final court approval and other conditions.\n\n## GARRETT LITIGATION AND BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS\n\nIn conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into a binding indemnification and reimbursement agreement (Garrett Indemnity) and a binding tax matters agreement (Tax Matters Agreement) with Garrett and a Garrett subsidiary. On December 2, 2019, Garrett and Garrett ASASCO Inc. filed a Summons with Notice and commenced a lawsuit in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the State Court), seeking to invalidate the Garrett Indemnity. Garrett sought damages and a declaratory judgment based on various claims set forth in the Summons with Notice. On July 17, 2020, the Company received a notice from Garrett asserting that the Company had caused material breaches of the Tax Matters Agreement and that the Tax Matters Agreement was unenforceable.\n\nOn September 20, 2020, Garrett and 36 of its affiliates  filed  voluntary  petitions  for  relief  under  Chapter  11  of  the  United  States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On September 24, 2020, Garrett moved the existing State Court litigation against Honeywell to the Bankruptcy Court. For the year ended December 31,  2020,  the  Company  reviewed  the  aggregate  carrying  value  of  the  receivable  amounts  due  in  connection  with  the  Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement and reduced the aggregate carrying value of the receivable by $509 million to reflect the present value of the amounts owed to the Company over the full term of these agreements.\n\nOn April 26, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Garrett's amended Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the Confirmed Plan), and on  April  30,  2021  (the  Effective  Date),  Garrett  emerged  from  bankruptcy.  On  the  Effective  Date,  and  in  accordance  with  the Confirmed Plan, (i) the Company received from Garrett an initial payment of $375 million and 834.8 million shares of Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock in full and final satisfaction of the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement, (ii) the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement were terminated, (iii) the Company and Garrett mutually released each other from the claims asserted in all pending  legal  actions  related  to  the  Garrett  Indemnity  and  Tax  Matters  Agreement,  and  (iv)  all  pending  litigation  between  the Company and Garrett in connection with those agreements was resolved.\n\nThe original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation provides for mandatory redemptions by Garrett of $35 million in 2022  and  $100  million  per  year  from  2023  to  2030  (inclusive)  at  the  anniversary  of  the  Effective  Date,  unless  (i)  Garrett's consolidated EBITDA as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year is less than $425 million, or (ii) Garrett does not have sufficient funds available to pay the redemption, at which point the redemption amounts past due will accrue interest. The Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation also includes rights which allow (a) the Company to put the Series B Preferred Stock to Garrett if certain EBITDA conditions are met, and (b) Garrett to call the Series B Preferred Stock in whole or in part if certain EBITDA conditions are met.\n\nOn September 30, 2021, Garrett filed an Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Amendment required Garrett to partially redeem a portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before March 31, 2022, such that the present value of remaining outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock would be $400 million (First Partial Redemption), subject to applicable law, including that Garrett had funds legally available for the partial  redemption.  The  First  Partial  Redemption  would  be  applied  to  the  latest  scheduled  redemption  dates,  beginning  with  the shares  to  be  redeemed  in  2030.  The Amendment  also  provides  that  the  Company  cannot  exercise  its  right  to  put  the  Series  B Preferred Stock to Garrett until after December 31, 2022, subject to the EBITDA conditions described in the above section, unless the partial redemption does not occur on or before March 31, 2022. All other material terms and conditions in the Amendment were unchanged from the original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation.\n\nOn December 16, 2021, Garrett filed a Second Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Second Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Second Amendment accelerates the First Partial Redemption from March 31, 2022, to December 30, 2021, and allows Garrett to partially redeem an additional portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before  March  31,  2022,  such  that  the  present  value  of  remaining  outstanding  shares  of  the  Series  B  Preferred  Stock  will  be $207  million  (Second  Partial  Redemption).  The  Second  Partial  Redemption  is  subject  to  similar  terms  as  the  First  Partial Redemption, including that Garrett has funds legally available for the partial redemption. However, the Second Partial Redemption is also contingent upon Garrett completing the First Partial Redemption and either (i) increasing their revolving credit facility, or (ii) the Garrett Board of Directors determining that Garrett otherwise has sufficient liquidity to effect the Second Partial Redemption. The Second Partial Redemption would be applied to the earliest scheduled redemptions beginning with the shares to be redeemed on April 30, 2022.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts)\n\nOn December 17, 2021, Garrett  announced  their  intention  to  effect  the  First  Partial  Redemption  on  December  28,  2021,  in  the amount  of  $211  million,  and  plan  to  effect  the  Second  Partial  Redemption  during  the  first  quarter  of  2022  for  a  corresponding payment of $200 million. On December 28, 2021, Garrett paid $211 million for the amount due as the First Partial Redemption.\n\nThe Company recorded the Series B Preferred Stock at fair value at the Effective Date. The Company believes the present value of the mandatory redemptions is an appropriate basis for determining the fair value of the Series B Preferred Stock. The Company's present value reflects amortized cost determined by the present value of the mandatory redemptions discounted at 7.25%, which is the rate reflected in the Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation. The discount amount will accrete into interest income over the mandatory redemption period. In addition to the Series B Preferred Stock, the Company subscribed for 4.2 million shares of Garrett's Series A Preferred Stock, which are convertible into Garrett's Common Stock if certain conditions are met. Prior to and following  Garrett's  emergence  from  bankruptcy,  the  Company  also  held  2.9  million  shares  of  Garrett's  Common  Stock.  As  of December 31, 2021, Short-term investments included $34 million and Investments and long-term receivables included $423 million for the Company's investments in Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock.\n\n## OTHER MATTERS\n\nThe Company is subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of the Company's business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters (including the matter described below). The Company recognizes liabilities for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company continually assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes in such matters,  as  well  as  potential  ranges  of  possible  losses  (taking  into  consideration  any  insurance  recoveries),  based  on  a  careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts.\n\nSuch matters include:\n\n- Petrobras and Unaoil - The Company continues to cooperate with investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  and  the  Brazilian  authorities  relating  to  the  Company's  use  of  third  parties  who previously worked for the Company's UOP business in Brazil in relation to Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras) in connection with a  project  awarded  in  2010.  The  investigations  focus  on  compliance  with  the  U.S.  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  similar Brazilian laws (the UOP Matters), and involve, among other things, document production and interviews with former and current management and employees. The DOJ and the SEC are also examining a matter involving a foreign subsidiary's prior contract with Unaoil S.A.M. in Algeria executed in 2011. The Company continues to be engaged in discussions with the authorities with respect to a potential comprehensive resolution of these matters.\n\nAs the discussions are both ongoing and at different stages with regards to each respective authority, there can be no assurance as  to  whether  the  Company  will  reach  a  resolution  with  such  authorities  or  as  to  the  potential  timing,  terms,  or  collateral consequences of any such resolution. As a result, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these UOP Matters or the potential impact on the Company. Based on available information to date, the Company estimates that a potential comprehensive resolution of these UOP Matters would result in a probable loss of at least $160 million, and the Company has recorded a charge in this amount in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations, and accrued a corresponding liability on the Consolidated Balance  Sheet. Amounts  payable  to  authorities  pursuant  to  any  potential  final  comprehensive  resolution  could  differ  from  the amount recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Based on available information to date, the Company does not expect that any such difference would be material with respect to the Company's consolidated financial position.\n\nGiven the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations, the Company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably  possible  losses  (or  a  range  of  possible  losses)  in  excess  of  current  accruals  for  such  matters.  Considering  the Company's past experience and existing accruals, the Company does not expect the outcome of such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.\n\n98 Honeywell International Inc.",

In contrast, GE employs Level 3 valuation techniques\u2014such as discounted cash flow (DCF) methodologies\u2014for certain insurance and pension liabilities, where significant unobservable assumptions are required.

          "chunk_text": "INSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include providing insurance and reinsurance for life and health risks and providing certain annuity products. Primary product types include long-term care, structured settlement annuities, life and disability insurance contracts and investment contracts. Insurance contracts are contracts with significant mortality and/or morbidity risks, while investment contracts are contracts without such risks. Insurance revenue is comprised primarily of premiums and investment income. For traditional long-duration insurance contracts, we report premiums as revenue when due. Premiums received on non-traditional long-duration insurance contracts and investment contracts, including annuities without significant mortality risk, are not reported as revenue but rather as deposit liabilities. We recognize revenue for charges and assessments on these contracts, mostly for mortality, administration and surrender. Interest credited to policyholder accounts is charged to expense.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions. A s a run-off insurance operation consisting substantially all of reinsurance, contracts are grouped into cohorts by legal entity and product type, based on the date the reinsurance contract was consummated. Future policy benefit reserves are adjusted each period as a result of updating lifetime net premium ratios for differences between actual and expected experience with the retroactive effect of those variances recognized in current period earnings. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings.\n\nAs our insurance operations are in run-off, the locked-in discount rate is used for the computation of interest accretion on future policy benefit reserves recognized in earnings. However, cash flows used to estimate future policy benefit reserves are also discounted using an upper-medium grade (i.e., low credit risk) fixedincome instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristics of the liabilities and is updated each reporting period with changes recorded in A ccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). As a result, changes in the current discount rate at each reporting period are recognized as an adjustment to A OCI and not earnings each period, whereas, changes relating to cash flow assumptions are recognized in the Statement of Earnings (Loss).\n\nLiabilities for inv estment contracts equal the account value, that is, the amount that accrues to the benefit of the contract or policyholder including credited interest and assessments through the financial statement date. See Note 12 for further information.\n\nPOSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. We sponsor a number of pension and retiree health and life insurance benefit plans that we present in three categories, principal pension plans, other pension plans and principal retiree benefit plans. We use a December 31 measurement date for these plans. On our Statement of Financial Position, we measure our plan assets at fair value and the obligations at the present value of the estimated payments to plan participants. Participants earn benefits based on their service and pay. Those estimated future payment amounts are determined based on assumptions. Differences between our actual results and what we assumed are recorded in a separate component of equity each period. These differences are amortized into earnings over the remaining average future service of active employees or the expected life of inactive participants, as applicable, who participate in the plan. See Note 13 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability  in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROG RAMS. We evaluate supply chain finance programs to ensure where we use a third-party intermediary to settle our trade payables, their inv olv ement does not change the nature, existence, amount or timing of our trade payables and does not provide the Company with any direct economic benefit. If any  characteristics of the trade pay ables change or we receive a direct economic benefit, we reclassify the trade payables as borrowings.\n\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. The following sections describe the valuation methodologies we use to measure financial and non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value including certain assets within our pension plans and retiree benefit plans. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These inputs establish a fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and Level 3 Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.\n\n46 2024 FORM  10-K",

      "question": "How does the use of unobservable inputs in private equity fund valuations by MMM's pension plan compare to UPS's approach of modeling equity price risk, given that both rely on valuation models with different degrees of market sensitivity?",
      "answer": "MMM's pension plan holds private equity funds valued at NAV, which rely on valuation models incorporating unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable market data, as stated in the LMT_10k_2023.pdf. In contrast, UPS explicitly discloses the use of valuation models to assess equity price risk, assuming instantaneous and parallel shifts in equity prices. MMM's reliance on opaque private equity valuation models introduces higher uncertainty in reporting pension asset values (e.g., a $144 million net increase in 2023 due to net purchases and unrealized gains, partly influenced by these unobservable inputs), while UPS's approach directly quantifies exposure to equity market fluctuations, allowing for more transparent sensitivity analysis despite acknowledging inherent modeling limitations.",

      "answer": "FDX reported $1,207 million in government securities as part of its $3,528 million international plan assets in 2023, representing approximately 34.2%. In comparison, HON had $2,045 million invested in government securities as of December 31, 2022. This shows that while FDX had a moderate allocation to government securities within its international plan, HON's total investment in government securities was higher in absolute terms.",

      "answer": "Honeywell values its fixed income investments using pricing models, broker bids, or discounted cash flows, incorporating adjustments for credit and liquidity risks when necessary. 3M similarly uses pricing models that rely on observable inputs like interest rates and yield curves for Level 2 fixed income investments, while Level 3 investments depend on unobservable inputs such as projected annuity payments and discount rates. Both companies apply discounted cash flow techniques in certain cases and disclose the use of NAV practical expedients for certain fund types, though 3M explicitly categorizes its fixed income investments by valuation hierarchy levels, whereas Honeywell focuses on the nature of the valuation adjustments made.",

Sufficient cash or cash equivalents are held by the Company's pension plans to cover the notional value of the futures contracts. A s of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company's U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $1,991 million and $4,025 million, respectively . A s of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company's non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $195 million and $124 million, respectively . In both the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is related to outstanding equity and fixed income futures contracts.\n\nCommon stocks, preferred stocks, broad index exposures with ETFs, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgage/asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows, and as such, include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity , debt, real estate and hedge funds, and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. V aluation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. The insurance buy-in contracts represent policies held by the Honeywell UK Pension Scheme, whereby the cost of providing pension benefits to plan participants is funded by the policies. The cash flows from the policies are intended to match the pension benefits. The fair value of these policies is based on an estimate of the policies' exit price.\n\nThe Company's funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company was not required to make contributions to the U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made. The Company is not required to make any contributions to the U.S. pension plans in 2025. In 2024, contributions of $15 million were made to the non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2025, the Company expects to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $6 million to the nonU.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Contributions for both the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets.\n\n108 Honeywell International Inc.",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $990 million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024.

The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities then divided by the number of units outstanding and is determined by the investment manager or custodian of the fund. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the fair value of plan assets.\n\nEquities consist primarily of mandates in public equity securities managed to various public equity indices. Publicly traded equities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.\n\nFixed Income investments include domestic and foreign government, and corporate debt securities. The debt securities are valued at the closing price reported if traded on an active market or at yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnership interests in a variety of funds which are valued at NAV as described above. Real estate consists of property funds and REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts). REITS are valued at NAV with published prices provided by the custodians.\n\nAbsolute return consists primarily of private partnership interests in hedge funds, insurance contracts and derivative instruments. Partnerships and hedge funds are valued at NAV as described above. Insurance consists of insurance contracts, which are valued using cash surrender values which is the amount the plan would receive if the contract was cashed out at year end.

Supplier Finance Program Obligations\n\nUnder supplier finance programs, 3M agrees to pay participating banks the stated amount of confirmed invoices from its designated suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices, generally within 90 days of the invoice date. 3M or the banks may terminate the agreements with advance notice. Separately, the banks may have arrangements with the suppliers that provide them the option to request early payment from the banks for invoices confirmed by 3M. 3M's outstanding balances of confirmed invoices in the programs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. These amounts are included within accounts payable on 3M's consolidated balance sheet. The activity in 2024 included approximately $1.5 billion of invoices confirmed and $1.5 billion of invoices paid and other adjustments.\n\n## NOTE 17. Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3M's financial position and performance.\n\nAdditional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:\n\n- Impact on other comprehensive income of non-derivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 9.\n- Fair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 18.\n- Derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company's long-term debt are also described in Note 14.\n\nRefer to the section below titled Location on Statement of Income (Loss) and Impact of Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments for details on the location within the consolidated statements of income (loss) for amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow or fair value hedges (along with similar information relative to the hedged items) and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Additional information relative to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included below as applicable.\n\nCash Flow Hedges: For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts: The Company may enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of ex change rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The Company may de-designate a cash flow hedge if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable, if 3M determines that the hedge is no longer expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction, or in certain other circumstances. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income for de-designated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in the value of derivative instruments after de-designation are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments section below. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months.\n\nCash Flow Hedging - Interest Rate Contracts: The Company may use forward starting interest rate contracts and treasury rate lock contracts to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments on forecasted debt issuances.\n\nThe amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the gain/(loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had a balance of $15 million associated with the after-tax net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). This includes a remaining balance of $80 million (after-tax loss) related to forward starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock contracts terminated in 2019 concurrent with associated debt issuances, which is being amortized over the respective lives of the underlying notes. Based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, of the total after-tax net unrealized balance as of December 31, 2024, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $44 million after-tax  net unrealized gain over the nex t 12 months (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).",

This ASU requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

          "chunk_text": "RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, primarily investment securities and derivatives, fair v alue is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability  in an orderly  transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. See Note 21 for further information.\n\nDebt Securities. When available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of debt securities which are included in Level 1. For our remaining debt securities, we obtain pricing information from an independent pricing vendor. The inputs and assumptions to the pricing vendor's models are derived from market observable sources including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other marketrelated data. These investments are included in Level 2. Our pricing vendors may also provide us with valuations that are based on significant unobservable inputs, and in those circumstances, we classify the investment securities in Level 3.\n\nAnnually, we conduct reviews of our primary pricing vendor to validate that the inputs used in that vendor's pricing process are deemed to be market observable as defined in the standard. We believe that the prices received from our pricing vendor are representative of prices that would be received to sell the assets at the measurement date (exit prices) and are classified appropriately in the hierarchy. We use non-binding broker quotes and other third-party pricing services as our primary basis for valuation when there is limited, or no, relevant market activity for a specific instrument or for other instruments that share similar characteristics. Debt securities priced in this manner are included in Level 3.\n\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values . These publicly traded equity securities are valued using quoted prices and are included in Level 1.\n\nDerivatives. The majority of our derivatives are valued using internal models. The models maximize the use of market observable inputs including interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 2 primarily represent interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency and commodity forward and option contracts.\n\nInvestments in private equity, real estate and collective funds held within our pension plans or run-off insurance operations . M ost inv estments are generally valued using the net asset value (NA V ) per share as a practical expedient for fair value provided certain criteria are met. The NA V s are determined based on the fair v alues of the underly ing inv estments in the funds. Inv estments that are measured at fair value using the NA V  practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair v alue hierarchy . Inv estments classified within Lev el 3 primarily  relate to real estate and priv ate equities which are v alued using unobserv able inputs, primarily by discounting expected future cash flows, using comparative market multiples, third-party pricing sources, or a combination of these approaches as appropriate. See Notes 3 and 13 for further information.\n\nNONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets may include loans and longliv ed assets reduced to fair value upon classification as held for sale, impaired loans based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, impaired equity securities without readily determinable fair value, equity method investments and long-lived assets and remeasured retained investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in the deconsolidation of that subsidiary and retention of a noncontrolling stake in the entity. Assets written down to fair value when impaired and retained investments are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.\n\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair value and Associated companies. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value and associated companies are valued using market observable data such as transaction prices when available. When market observable data is unavailable, investments are valued using either a discounted cash flow model, comparative market multiples, third-party pricing sources or a combination of these approaches as appropriate. These investments are generally included in Level 3.\n\nLong-lived Assets . Fair v alues of long-liv ed assets are primarily  deriv ed internally  and are based on observed sales transactions for similar assets or discounted cash flow estimates. In other instances for which we do not have comparable observed sales transaction data, collateral values are developed internally and corroborated by external appraisal information. A djustments to third-party valuations may be performed in circumstances where market comparables are not specific to the attributes of the specific collateral or appraisal information may not be reflective of current market conditions due to the passage of time and the occurrence of market events since receipt of the information.\n\nADOPTIONS OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50) Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations . This guidance requires disclosures for supply chain finance programs using a retrospective approach, except for the annual roll-forward which is applicable prospectively in the period beginning January 1, 2024. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn 2024, we adopted ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , on a retrospective basis. The amendments are intended to increase reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.

      "answer": "RTX faces exposure to cost overruns on fixed-price contracts due to inflationary pressures, rising material and labor costs, and supply chain disruptions, which could lead to losses since they are often unable to increase contract pricing. In contrast, Boeing experienced actual financial losses on its fixed-price defense contracts in 2023, including $1,585 million in additional losses on five major programs such as the KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.

      "answer": "FedEx disclosed that as of its 2024 annual meeting, there were 50,900,000 shares remaining available for future issuance under its equity compensation plans, excluding shares reflected in other columns related to outstanding options and warrants. Meanwhile, Emerson Electric (EMR) highlighted its universal shelf registration statement that allows the company to issue various securities, including warrants, with no predetermined limit and flexible terms determined at the time of sale. While FedEx's equity compensation plan focuses on employee incentives with a defined remaining share pool, Emerson's approach includes warrants as part of a broader capital structure flexibility strategy, enabling access to capital markets as needed.

The decrease in 2024 reflected the repayment of \u20ac500 of 0.375% euro notes that matured in May 2024. The decrease in 2023 included a net reduction in short-term borrowings of approximately $1.6 billion and repayments of long-term debt of $741 (including $264 related to AspenTech's repayment of the outstanding balance on its existing term loan facility plus accrued interest). Activ ity in 2022 included the issuance of $3 billion of long-term debt and increased commercial paper borrowings of approximately $1.3 billion. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes and the increased commercial paper borrowings to fund the majority of its contribution of approximately $6.0 billion to existing stockholders of Heritage AspenTech as part of the transaction. Long-term debt was issued in December 2021 as follows: $1 billion of 2.0% notes due December 2028, $1 billion of 2.2% notes due December 2031, and $1 billion of 2.8% notes due December 2051. Additionally, the Company repaid $500 of 2.625% notes that matured in 2022. See Note 4 and Note 13.\n\nThe total debt-to-total capital ratio decreased slightly in 2024, reflecting repayments of long-term debt, while the net debt-to-net capital ratio increased reflecting the use of cash held on the balance sheet at September 30, 2023 that was used to complete the NI acquisition. These ratios decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 due to the proceeds and after-tax gains (which increased common stockholder's equity) on the Copeland transaction and InSinkErator div estiture. The interest cov erage ratio is computed as earnings before income taxes plus interest expense, div ided by interest expense. The decrease in 2024 reflects lower GAAP pretax earnings largely due to the NI acquisition. Excluding the impact from acquisition-related inv entory stepup amortization of $231, higher intangibles amortization of $595, acquisition/div estiture fees and related costs of $220, higher restructuring and related costs of $152, the loss of $279 on the Copeland note receiv able and the gain on the subordinated interest of $79, the interest cov erage ratio was 11.6X . The Company's earnings increased in 2023 which offset higher interest expense due to the increased long-term debt and commercial paper borrowings to fund the Heritage AspenTech acquisition.\n\nIn February 2023, the Company entered into a $3.5 billion fiv e-year rev olv ing backup credit facility with v arious banks, which replaced the May 2018 $3.5 billion facility. T he credit facility is maintained to support general corporate purposes, including commercial paper borrowings. The Company has not incurred any borrowings under this or prev ious facilities. The credit facility contains no financial cov enants and is not subject to termination based on a change of credit rating or material adv erse changes. The facility is unsecured and may be accessed under v arious interest rate alternativ es at the Company's option. Fees to maintain the facility are immaterial. The Company also maintains a univ ersal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which it can issue debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, share purchase contracts or share purchase units without a predetermined limit. Securities can be sold in one or more separate offerings with the size, price and terms to be determined at the time of sale.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .\n\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value.\n\n- U.S. and Foreign Government Securities : U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities and municipal securities. Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Corporate Debt Instruments : Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Common Stock : Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date.\n- Collective Investment Funds : Collective investment funds consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index. They are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective collective investment funds. The underlying assets are valued based on the net asset value ('NAV'), which is provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCash Flows: Altria makes contributions to the pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax deductible and pays benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. Currently, Altria anticipates making employer contributions to its pension and postretirement plans of up to approximately $30 million for each in 2022. However, the foregoing estimates of 2022 contributions to the pension and postretirement plans are subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, changes in interest rates, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return for each respective plan.\n\nEstimated future benefit payments at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

The valuation of Level 3 investments requires significant judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity, and the long-term nature of such assets. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate, hedge funds, and other private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. These estimates incorporate factors such as contributions and distributions, market transactions, market comparables, and performance multiples.\n\nThe fair values of investments by level and asset category and the weighted-average asset allocations for our U.S. Pension Plans and our most significant international pension plans at the measurement date are presented in the following table (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How does the deferral of ASU 2020-04's sunset date under ASU 2022-06 impact both Caterpillar's and UPS's transition strategies for replacing LIBOR-based financial instruments with alternative reference rates like SOFR?",
      "answer": "ASU 2022-06 deferred the sunset date of ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, giving companies more time to transition away from LIBOR. Caterpillar is subject to ASU 2022-06, which provides relief related to reference rate reform. Meanwhile, UPS has transitioned its affected debt instruments and contracts to SOFR, the alternative reference rate adopted by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, and while it did not elect the practical expedients under Topic 848, it will continue to assess transactions for potential impact through 2024. The deferral thus allows UPS to maintain flexibility in managing its transition strategy beyond the original deadline.",

        "Hop 3: ASU 2020-04 \u2190 UPS: UPS transitioned its affected debt instruments to SOFR and, although it did not apply the practical expedients under Topic 848, it will continue to assess the impact through 2024 due to the extended sunset date."

Significant changes in U.S. government defense spending or changes in U.S. government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\nWe Face Risks Relating to Our U.S. Government Contracts and the Mix of Our U.S. Government Contracts and Programs that Could Negatively Impact our Financial Condition, Results of Operations, Liquidity and Overall Business. The termination of one or more of our contracts, or the occurrence of performance delays, cost overruns, product failures, materials or components shortages,  or  contract  definitization  delays,  could  negatively  impact  our  competitive  position,  results  of  operations,  financial condition and liquidity. U.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without  prior  notice,  at  the  U.S.  government's  convenience  or  for  default  based  on  performance.  If  one  of  our  contracts  is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for work accepted by the U.S. government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. In addition, we are a subcontractor on some contracts and the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, without regard to our performance as a subcontractor. We can give no assurance that we would be awarded new U.S. government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of the termination  of  any  of  our  contracts.  In  addition,  because  the  funding  of  U.S.  government  programs  is  subject  to  congressional appropriations made on a fiscal year basis even for multi-year programs, programs are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future years. Appropriation bills may be delayed, which may result in delays to funding, the collection of receivables and our contract performance due to lack of authorized funds to procure related products and services. Under certain circumstances, we may use our own funds to meet our customer's desired delivery dates or other requirements, but we may not be reimbursed. Further, if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable, reduced or delayed, the U.S. government may terminate for  convenience our contract or subcontract under that program. In addition, our U.S. government contracts typically involve  the  development,  application  and  manufacture  of  advanced  defense  and  technology  systems  and  products  aimed  at achieving  challenging  goals.  New  technologies  may  be  untested  or  unproven  and  in  some  instances,  product  requirements  or specifications may be modified. As a result, we may experience technological and other performance difficulties, which may result in delays, setbacks, cost overruns or product failures, and could divert our attention or resources from other projects. Our failure to execute effectively on our development programs could impact our future sales opportunities. Additionally, in order to win certain U.S. government contracts, we may be required to invest in development prior to award as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions. These additional investments may not be worthwhile if we are not chosen for these awards.\n\nOur U.S. government contracts are typically either fixed-priced contracts or cost reimbursement contracts. Fixed-price contracts are predominantly either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, we generally share with the U.S. government savings for cost underruns less than target costs and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated ceiling price. We carry the entire burden of cost overruns exceeding the ceiling price amount under FPI contracts. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed or performance-based fee, but  we  are  generally  not  reimbursed  for  unauthorized  costs  exceeding  a  cost  ceiling  amount  or  costs  not  allowable  under  the contract or applicable regulations. If we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, our profitability could be negatively affected, particularly under fixed-price development contracts. We may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenues, and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenues. While contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are  typically  cost  reimbursable,  they  can  be  FFP  or  FPI,  which  can  significantly  increase  our  risk  of  a  potential  negative  profit adjustment, as development contracts by nature involve elements that have not been undertaken before and, thus, are highly subject to  future  unexpected cost growth. In addition, other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production, which includes starting and stabilizing a manufacturing and test line while the final design is still being validated. Moreover, over the past several years, the DoD has increased its use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracts, under which it awards certain prototypes, research and production contracts without all of the procurement requirements that typically apply to DoD contracts, including justification of sole source awards. OTAs may use fixed-price contracts during all phases of the contract, or mandated contract  cost  sharing  (e.g.,  one-third  of  program  costs).  They  may  also  require  non-traditional  subcontractor  participation  and impose other requirements that differ from our other DoD contracts. Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to perform on our OTA contracts, including any applicable non-traditional requirements. Moreover, from time to time, we may begin performance under an undefinitized contract action with a not-to-exceed price prior to completing contract negotiations in order to support U.S. government priorities. Uncertainties in final contract price, specifications and terms, or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization, may negatively affect our profitability. In addition, as discussed more fully below, our U.S. government contracts also require us to comply with extensive and evolving procurement rules and regulations and subject us to potential U.S. government audits, investigations, and disputes. We are also involved in programs that are classified by the U.S.",

We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.\n\n## REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  and  the  Cost Accounting  Standards  (CAS)  govern  the  majority  of  our  contracts.  The  FAR  mandates uniform  policies  and  procedures  for  U.S.  government  acquisitions  and  purchased  services.  Also,  individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the  FAR.  For  example,  the  DoD  implements  the  FAR  through  the  Defense  Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement  (DFARS).  For  all  federal  government  entities,  the  FAR  regulates  the  phases  of  any  product  or service acquisition, including:\n\n- acquisition planning;\n- competition requirements;\n- contractor qualifications;\n- protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n- acquisition procedures.\n\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\n\n## NON-U.S. REGULATORY\n\nOur  non-U.S.  operations  are  subject  to  the  applicable  government  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\n\n## BUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\n\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety  Agency  (EASA)  and  the  Civil  Aviation  Administration  of  China  (CAAC).  For  an  aircraft  to  be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each  aircraft  must  receive  a  certificate  of  airworthiness.  Aircraft  outfitting  and  completions  also  require approval  by  the  appropriate  aviation  authority,  which  is  often  accomplished  through  a  supplemental  type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and  regulations  cover  the  discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal,  investigation  and  remediation  of  materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations.

We  consider  securities  with  a maturity  of  three  months  or  less  to  be  cash  equivalents.  Our  cash  balances  are  invested  primarily  in  time deposits rated A-/A3 or higher. Our investments in other securities are included in other current and noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We report our equity securities at fair value with subsequent changes in  fair  value  recognized  in  net  earnings.  We  report  our  available-for-sale  debt  securities  at  fair  value  with unrealized  gains  and  losses  recognized  as  a  component  of  other  comprehensive  income  in  the  Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. We had no trading or held-to-maturity debt securities on December 31, 2021 or 2020. See Note P for additional information regarding our investments in debt and equity securities.\n\nOther Contract Costs. Other contract costs represent amounts accrued under GAAP that are not currently allocable to U.S. government contracts in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). These costs include workers' compensation, pension and other post-retirement benefits,  and  environmental  obligations.  We  defer  these  costs  in  other  current  assets  on  the  Consolidated Balance  Sheet  until  they  can  be  allocated  to  contracts,  which  is  generally  after  they  are  paid.  We  expect  to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. We regularly  assess  the  probability  of  recovery  of  these  costs.  If  the  backlog  in  the  future  does  not  support  the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Other contract costs on December 31, 2021 and 2020, were $305 and $499, respectively.\n\nAcquisitions  and  Divestitures. In  the  last  three  years,  we  acquired  six  businesses  in  our  Aerospace segment,  two  businesses  in  our  Combat  Systems  segment  and  a  business  in  our  Technologies  segment.  The operating results of these acquisitions have been included with our reported results since the respective closing dates. The purchase prices of the acquisitions have been allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill.\n\nIn  2020,  we  completed  the  sale  of  a  business  in  our  Aerospace  segment  and  two  businesses  in  our Technologies  segment,  one  of  which  was  classified  as  held  for  sale  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  on December  31,  2019.  In  2019,  we  completed  the  sale  of  a  business  in  our  Technologies  segment  that  was classified as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on December 31, 2018.\n\nLong-lived  Assets  and  Goodwill. We  review  long-lived  assets,  including  intangible  assets  subject  to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows. Impairment losses, where identified, are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived assets over the estimated fair value as determined by discounted cash flows.",

AspenTech, as defined in Note 4, operates as a separate publicly traded company and has v arious stock-based compensation plans, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units, which are settled in their own common stock and are accounted for as equity awards. Restricted stock units and performance stock units generally v est ov er three years. In fiscal 2023 and 2024, the Company granted performance stock units with both a performance and serv ice condition. The performance condition relates to the attainment of predefined goals based on annual contract v alue and free cash flows. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the probability that the threshold performance goals will be achiev ed, if at all, and the anticipated lev el of attainment to determine the amount of compensation expense to record in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Option awards hav e been granted with an exercise price equal to the market closing price of AspenTech's stock on the trading day prior to the grant date. These options generally v est ov er four years and expire within sev en years or ten years of grant. AspenTech's policy is to issue new shares upon the exercise of v ested stock awards.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement between Emerson and Heritage AspenTech, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock, whether vested or unvested, that was unexercised as of immediately prior to the closing date was conv erted into an option to acquire shares of AspenTech. Each conv erted option is subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original option. In addition, each outstanding award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock that were unv ested as of immediately prior to the closing date was conv erted into an award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of AspenTech. Each conv erted restricted stock unit is also subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original restricted stock unit.\n\nASC 805 required the Company to determine the fair v alue of the AspenTech share-based payment awards related to the replacement of the Heritage AspenTech share-based payment awards, and allocate the total fair v alue based on the serv ices that are attributable to the pre- and post-combination serv ice periods, respectiv ely. The portion that is attributable to the pre-combination serv ice period was considered part of the consideration transferred for Heritage AspenTech and included as part of the purchase price. The portion that is attributable to the post-combination serv ice period is recognized as stock-based compensation expense in the post-combination consolidated financial statements ov er the remaining requisite serv ice period.\n\n## AspenTech Stock Options\n\nAspenTech utilizes the Black-Scholes option v aluation model for estimating the fair v alue of options granted. The Black-Scholes option v aluation model incorporates assumptions regarding expected stock price v olatility, the expected life of the option, the risk-free interest rate, div idend yield and the market value of AspenTech's common stock. The expected stock price v olatility is determined based on AspenTech's stock's historic prices ov er a period commensurate with the expected life of the award.

      "answer": "LMT transferred pension liabilities by purchasing a group annuity contract, which led to a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion in 2022 and $1.7 billion in 2021 due to the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses. This annuitization was executed through a third-party insurer, as evidenced by the JNJ filing which noted that such contracts involve transfers to insurers\u2014UPS similarly transferred a portion of its workers\u2019 compensation liabilities for policy years 2001\u20132006 and 2017 to a third-party insurer, paying $151 million against reserves of $153 million and recognizing a $2 million pre-tax gain. Both companies used third-party insurers to offload legacy liabilities, but LMT\u2019s transaction was significantly larger in scale and triggered settlement accounting, whereas UPS\u2019s transfer resulted in a modest gain and was part of a broader self-insurance accrual strategy.",

      "answer": "FedEx applied ASU 2020-04 to contracts referencing LIBOR or other discontinued rates, using optional expedients through December 31, 2024, with no material effect on financial condition or results of operations as of May 31, 2024. ASU 2020-04 specifically allows relief for contract modifications related to reference rate reform, reducing operational complexity. UPS, while not directly referencing ASU 2020-04, details its approach to contract modifications that change existing enforceable rights and obligations\u2014modifications that do not add distinct services typically change the price of existing services and are accounted for prospectively. Both companies manage variable consideration through customer incentives and performance metrics, with FedEx recognizing revenue proportionally as costs are incurred (cost-to-cost measure) and UPS adjusting revenue estimates based on probable outcomes of incentive tiers and performance metrics. The guidance in ASU 2020-04 would specifically apply to any contract modifications at FedEx related to reference rate reform, while UPS\u2019s broader contract modification policy governs how such changes affect revenue recognition prospectively.",

The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. |\n",

      "question": "How do the roles of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in 3M's and Boeing's credit agreements reflect differences in their syndication strategies for financing arrangements?",
      "answer": "In 3M's case, the evidence shows that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is involved through the Five-Year Credit Agreement dated May 11, 2023, which has undergone multiple amendments (e.g., Amendment No. 1 on July 7, 2023, and Amendment No. 2 on September 18, 2023). This indicates a dynamic and potentially evolving syndication strategy with active lender coordination. In contrast, Boeing's filings show that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. serves as a syndication agent and joint lead arranger in multiple agreements, including the Five-Year Credit Agreement dated October 30, 2019, and the August 24, 2023, 364-Day Credit Agreement. This suggests Boeing consistently relies on JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a key syndication partner across multiple credit facilities. The difference in how each company structures its relationship with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. indicates that 3M may be more flexible or reactive in adjusting its syndication strategy, while Boeing maintains a more stable and recurring syndication partnership.",

        "Hop 1: MMM \u2192 Five Year Credit Agreement: 3M's Five-Year Credit Agreement, dated May 11, 2023, has been amended multiple times, indicating an evolving financing structure with active lender coordination.",

These real estate funds are structured as limited partnerships, as disclosed in the fair value hierarchy. BA, on the other hand, invests in limited partnerships that include global private investments in real estate and real assets, covering areas such as office, retail, apartment, and industrial properties, as well as natural resources and infrastructure. While UNP's exposure is relatively small and focused on real estate funds, BA's strategy is broader, encompassing both real estate and real assets through LPs.",

      "answer": "Honeywell targets 5%-10% of its U.S. pension plan assets to be allocated to real estate investments. However, as disclosed in UPS's 10-K, real estate investments valued using NAV are subject to delays due to reliance on audited financial reports from fund managers and require adjustments for investment activity between reporting periods. This creates potential misalignments in valuation timing and liquidity constraints, as UPS notes that real estate fund redemptions are typically limited until the end of partnership terms (10\u201315 years). These factors could hinder Honeywell's ability to promptly rebalance its pension portfolio to stay within its 5%-10% real estate allocation target, especially given the illiquid nature and subjective valuation methods of such investments.",

      "answer": "UNP values its real estate funds using the NAV practical expedient, derived from property appraisals, and these funds typically have terms between 8 and 10 years. Similarly, FDX applies the NAV practical expedient to equity securities without readily determinable fair values. However, FDX also uses a measurement alternative for other equity securities, adjusting cost for observable price changes and impairments. Unlike UNP, which relies on appraisals and long-term structures, FDX's NAV-based valuations are tied to the underlying investments' reported NAV without adjustments, and it separately discloses unrealized gains and losses, such as $14 million in 2024. These differences in valuation approach and disclosure suggest distinct applications of the NAV practical expedient between the two companies.",

T hese  assets  are  v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by independent pricing sources. Federal Gov ernment Securities are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nBonds and Debentures -  Bonds  and  debentures  consist  of  debt  securities  issued  by  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  corporations  as  well  as  state  and  local governments.  These assets are v alued  using  a  bid  ev aluation  process  with  bid  data  prov ided  by  independent  pricing  sources.  Corporate,  state,  and municipal bonds and debentures are classified as Lev el 2 inv estments.\n\nCorporate Stock - This inv estment category consists of common and preferred stock issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations. Most common shares are traded activ ely on exchanges and price quotes for these shares are readily av ailable. Common stock is classified as a Lev el 1 inv estment. Preferred shares included in this category are v alued using a bid ev aluation process with bid data prov ided by independent pricing sources. Preferred stock is classified as a Lev el 2 inv estment.\n\nVenture Capital and Buyout Partnerships - This inv estment category is comprised of interests in limited partnerships that inv est primarily in priv atelyheld companies. Due to the priv ate nature of the partnership inv estments, pricing inputs are not readily observ able. Asset v aluations are dev eloped by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These v aluations are based on the application of public market multiples to priv ate company cash flows, market transactions that prov ide v aluation information for comparable companies, and other methods. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using each partnership's net asset v alue (NAV).\n\nReal Estate Funds -  T he  plan's  real  estate  inv estments  are  primarily  interests  in  priv ate  real  estate  inv estment  trusts,  partnerships,  limited  liability companies, and similar structures. Valuations for the holdings in this category are not based on readily observ able inputs and are primarily deriv ed from property appraisals. The fair v alue recorded by the plan is calculated using the NAV for each inv estment.\n\nCollective  Trust  and  Other  Funds -  Collectiv e  trust  and  other  funds  are  comprised  of  shares  or  units  in  commingled  funds  and  limited  liability companies that are not publicly traded. The underlying assets in these entities (global stock funds and short-term inv estment funds) are publicly traded on exchanges and price quotes for the assets held by these funds are readily av ailable.

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $990 million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin faces cybersecurity risks that could result in breaches compromising customer or third-party data, potentially leading to claims against the company and triggering indemnification obligations. These risks are heightened due to the national security nature of its business and the sensitivity of the data it protects. Meanwhile, Solventum, following its spin-off from 3M, assumed certain legal liabilities, including those previously disclosed in 3M\u2019s filings under the Bair Hugger and Federal False Claims Act/Qui Tam Litigation sections. Under the separation and distribution agreement, Solventum is responsible for indemnifying 3M in these matters. Therefore, while both companies have indemnification exposures, Lockheed Martin\u2019s are tied to cybersecurity vulnerabilities, whereas Solventum\u2019s are rooted in legacy legal liabilities assumed post-spinoff.",

Moreover, depending on the severity of an incident, our customers' data, our employees' data, our intellectual property (including trade secrets and research, development and engineering know-how) and other third-party data (such as that of subcontractors, suppliers and vendors) could be compromised, which could adversely affect our business. Products and services we provide to customers also carry cybersecurity risks, including risks that they could be breached or fail to detect, prevent or combat attacks, which could result in losses to our customers and claims against us, and could harm our relationships with our customers and financial results.\n\nGiven the persistence, sophistication, volume and novelty of threats we face, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating an attack that could have a material adverse effect on us and the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. The national  security  aspects  of  our  business  and  much  of  the  data  we  protect  increase  and  create  different  risks  relative  to  other  industries.  National  security considerations may also preclude us from publicly disclosing a cybersecurity incident.\n\nOur customers (including sites that we operate and manage for our customers), suppliers, subcontractors, joint venture partners and acquired entities face similar security threats and an incident at one of these entities could adversely impact our business. These entities are typically outside our control and may have access to our information with varying levels of security and cybersecurity resources, expertise, safeguards and capabilities. Their relationships with government contractors, including us, may increase the risk that they are targeted by the same threats we face, however, they may not be as prepared for such threats. Adversaries actively seek to exploit security and cybersecurity weaknesses in our supply chain. Breaches in our multi-tiered supply chain, which is comprised of thousands of direct and indirect  suppliers,  have  and  could  in  the  future  compromise  our  data  and  adversely  affect  customer  deliverables.  We  also  must  rely  on  our  supply  chain  for adequately detecting and reporting cyber incidents, which could affect our ability to report or respond to cybersecurity incidents effectively or in a timely manner.\n\nFor information on our cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance, see Item 1C. - Cybersecurity.\n\n## If we fail to successfully complete or manage acquisitions, divestitures, equity investments and other transactions or if acquired entities or equity investments fail to perform as expected, our financial results, business and future prospects could be harmed.\n\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate companies, and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, joint ventures, other investments and divestitures. We seek to identify acquisition or investment opportunities that will expand or complement our existing products and services or customer base, at reasonable valuations. To be successful, we must conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies or underlying risks, some of which are difficult to discover or assess prior to consummation of an acquisition or investment; negotiate transaction terms; complete and close complex transactions; integrate acquired companies and employees; and realize anticipated operating synergies efficiently and effectively. U.S. regulators have increased their scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions in recent years, which could continue to limit our ability to execute certain transactions that we might otherwise pursue.\n\nAcquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and investments often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. Unidentified or identified but uncertain liabilities that are not covered by indemnification or other coverage could adversely affect our future financial results. This is particularly the case in respect of successor liability under procurement laws and regulations such as the False Claims Act or the Truthful Cost or Pricing Data Act (formerly the Truth in Negotiations Act), anti-corruption, environmental, tax, import-export and technology transfer laws, which provide for civil and criminal penalties and the potential for debarment. We also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, employee retention, transaction-related or other litigation, and other liabilities. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nJoint ventures and other noncontrolling investments operate under shared control with other parties. These investments typically face many of the same risks and uncertainties as we do, but may expose us to additional risks not present if we retained full control. A joint venture partner may have economic or other business interests that are inconsistent with ours and we may be unable to prevent strategic decisions that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of",

      "answer": "MMM discloses that its fixed income investments, which include mortgage-backed securities, are valued at the closing price reported in active markets or based on yields for comparable securities. This valuation method suggests a more market-sensitive approach, as these instruments are directly tied to current market yields. In contrast, BA reports unrealized gains and losses for Level 3 mortgage-backed securities, which indicates the use of more subjective valuation models and less reliance on active market pricing. As a result, MMM\u2019s portfolio may reflect more immediate market volatility, while BA\u2019s Level 3 classification implies less frequent but potentially more volatile adjustments, as seen in BA\u2019s reported changes in unrealized gains/losses such as ($1) million for 2021 and $1 million for 2020.",

A s of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company's non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $195 million and $124 million, respectively . In both the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is related to outstanding equity and fixed income futures contracts.\n\nCommon stocks, preferred stocks, broad index exposures with ETFs, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgage/asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows, and as such, include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity , debt, real estate and hedge funds, and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. V aluation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. The insurance buy-in contracts represent policies held by the Honeywell UK Pension Scheme, whereby the cost of providing pension benefits to plan participants is funded by the policies. The cash flows from the policies are intended to match the pension benefits. The fair value of these policies is based on an estimate of the policies' exit price.\n\nThe Company's funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company was not required to make contributions to the U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made. The Company is not required to make any contributions to the U.S. pension plans in 2025. In 2024, contributions of $15 million were made to the non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2025, the Company expects to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $6 million to the nonU.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards.

Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $990 million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024. There are no expected required contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2025.\n\nThe following table presents estimated future benefit payments as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\n\n",

MMM, on the other hand, noted that its international pension plans' Level 3 assets (primarily insurance contracts under the absolute return category) decreased by $80 million in 2024, driven by net purchases/unrealized losses and currency exchange effects.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 2020 - $10.1 billion pre-tax actuarial loss related to benefit obligation:\n\n- Discount Rates ($7.3 billion pre-tax loss): The weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from 3.55% as of December 31, 2019 to 2.87% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decline in U.S. treasury yields that was slightly offset by an increase in credit spreads on AA-rated corporate bonds.\n- Coordinating benefits attributable to the Central States Pension Fund ($2.3 billion pre-tax loss): This represents our current best estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the Central States Pension Fund before taking into account the impact of the change in discount rates.\n- Demographic and Assumption Changes ($513 million pre-tax loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation changes, rates of termination, retirement, mortality and other changes.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Plan Assets\n\nPension assets are invested in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as investment guidelines established by plan trustees. The strategic asset mixes are specifically tailored for each plan given distinct factors, including liability and liquidity needs. Equities, alternative investments, and other higher yielding assets are utilized to generate returns and promote growth. Derivatives, repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements and fixed income securities are utilized as tools for duration management, mitigating interest rate risk, and minimizing funded status volatility.\n\nThe primary long-term investment objectives for pension assets are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital to meet future obligations while minimizing risk exposures and reducing funded status volatility. To meet these objectives, investment managers are engaged to actively manage assets within the guidelines and strategies set forth by the Investment Committee. Active managers are monitored regularly and their performance is compared to applicable benchmarks. As a result of our long-term U.S. investment objectives for pension assets, the weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on assets decreased from 7.77% during 2020 to 6.50% in 2021.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nPlan assets valued utilizing Level 1 inputs include equity investments, corporate debt instruments and U.S. government securities. Fair values were determined by closing prices for those securities traded on national stock exchanges, while securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on the valuation date are valued at the mean between the last reported bid and ask prices.\n\nLevel 2 assets include fixed income securities that are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of other issues with similar credit ratings; mortgage-backed securities that are valued based on cash flow and yield models using acceptable modeling and pricing conventions; and certain investments that are pooled with other investments in a commingled fund. We value our investments in commingled funds by taking the percentage ownership of the underlying assets, each of which has a readily determinable fair value.\n\nFair value estimates for certain investments are based on unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by observable market data and are thus classified as Level 3.\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a net asset value (\"NAV\") or its equivalent developed consistent with FASB measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, risk parity funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds and risk parity funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31st. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility.

      "answer": "UPS's U.S. pension plans held $9.9 billion in alternative investments as of December 31, 2023, including private debt, with unfunded commitments totaling approximately $3.3 billion expected to be contributed over 3 to 6 years. These investments are valued using NAV due to the lack of readily determinable fair value. Similarly, Boeing allocates to private debt as part of a diversified fixed income portfolio, with private equity and real assets also held through limited partnerships, typically having investment horizons of 10 to 15 years. Both companies face long-duration commitments, but UPS specifically discloses a shorter funding period for its unfunded commitments.",

        "Hop 1: UPS \u2192 NAV: UPS discloses that its U.S. pension and postretirement medical benefit plans held $9.9 billion in hedge fund, private debt, private equity, and real estate investments, primarily valued using NAV due to lack of active market trading.",
        "Hop 2: NAV \u2192 Private Debt: The NAV valuation method applies to private debt investments, which are subject to limited redemption provisions and typically have investment terms of 10 to 15 years, with UPS having $3.3 billion in unfunded commitments to be funded over 3 to 6 years.",

      "answer": "UPS's Class B common stockholders have limited voting rights, specifically in relation to corporate governance decisions such as mergers or amendments to the certificate of incorporation. They only have voting rights in specified circumstances, such as decisions to exit the core payments business, certain consolidation or merger transactions, or the approval of specific amendments to the certificate of incorporation that affect the terms of Class B or C common stock. In contrast, Honeywell\u2019s common stockholders are entitled to one vote per share on all matters generally subject to shareholder vote, with no distinction between classes of common stock. Honeywell does not have a differentiated voting structure like UPS, where certain decisions require separate class voting or are restricted to specific matters.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, licenses, patents, customer lists, non-compete agreements and franchise rights are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from 2 to 21 years. Capitalized software is generally amortized over 7 years. Finite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment as part of asset groups whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n## Assets Held for Sale\n\nWe classify long-lived assets or disposal groups as held for sale in the period when all of the following conditions have been met:\n\n- we have approved and committed to a plan to sell the assets or disposal group;\n- the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition;\n- an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the sale have been initiated;\n- the sale of the asset or disposal group is probable and expected to be completed within one year;\n- the asset or disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and\n- it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nWe initially measure a long-lived asset or disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell and recognize any loss in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. G ains are not recognized until the date of sale. We cease depreciation and amortization of a long-lived asset, or assets within a disposal group, upon their designation as held for sale and subsequently assess fair value less any costs to sell at each reporting date until the asset or disposal group is no longer classified as held for sale.\n\n## Supplier Finance Programs\n\nAs part of our working capital management, certain financial institutions offer a Supply Chain Finance (\"SCF\") program to certain of our suppliers. We agree to commercial terms with our suppliers, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. Suppliers issue invoices to us based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. If they participate in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, to sell to the financial institutions. Our suppliers' voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No guarantees are provided by us under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the SCF program.\n\nAmounts due to our suppliers that participate in the SCF program are included in Accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, suppliers sold $515 and $504 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations to participating institutions. A rollforward of obligations confirmed and paid during the year is presented below (dollars in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## (Dollars in Millions Except Per S hare Amounts)\n\nIn August 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-05, 'Business Combinations-Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement.' This ASU requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This guidance is applicable to joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 and is not ex pected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, 'Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.' This ASU clarified the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases under common control. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, 'Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.' This ASU requires a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the programs' key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated roll-forward information. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 1, 2023, and with respect to the roll-forward information disclosure, beginning on January 1, 2024. See Note 15, Supplier Finance Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of E stimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\nIn certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.\n\n- The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ('FIFO') method (approximately 75% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method (approximately 25% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2024 or 2023 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.\n- Shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company's Gross profit margin is not comparable with the Gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in Cost of sales. If such costs had been included as a component of Cost of sales, the Company's Gross profit margin would have been lower by 880 bps in 2024, 910 bps in 2023 and 1040 bps in 2022, with no impact on reported earnings.\n\nThe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax  valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.\n\n- In accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 5.73% and 5.40% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 5.74% and 5.37% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio",

          "chunk_text": "## HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts)\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (T opic 405): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs. The new standard requires annual disclosure of the key terms of the program, a description of where in the financial statements amounts outstanding under the program are presented, a rollforward of such amounts, and interim disclosure of amounts outstanding as of the end of each period. The guidance does not affect recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of supplier finance programs. The A SU was effective on January 1, 2023, except for the rollforward, which was effective on January 1, 2024. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2023, with the exception of the rollforward adopted on January 1, 2024. The adoption of this standard does not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nResearch and development costs for projects are expensed as incurred, unless these costs relate to contracts with customers where the Company receives reimbursements. Costs related to contracts with customers for customer-sponsored research and development projects are included as a contract cost and included in Cost of products and services sold when revenue from such contracts is recognized, consistent with the Company's sales recognition policies.\n\n## CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less.\n\n## INVENTORIES\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Carrying value adjustments for inventory obsolescence is equal to the difference between the cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Items capable of being sold, including as spare parts, are classified as finished goods.\n\n## PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty ,  plant  and  equipment  are  recorded  at  cost,  including  any   asset  retirement  obligations,  less  accumulated  depreciation.  For  financial  reporting,  the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and three to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability , the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding asset's useful life.\n\n## GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nThe Company recognizes goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances in conjunction with business combinations, with amounts being recorded at their  respective  fair  v alues  upon  the  closing  of  a  transaction.  Subsequent  to  the  closing  of  a  business  combination,  the  Company  evaluates  and  books adjustments, as applicable, to the preliminary amounts recorded over the relevant measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or if a triggering event occurs or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.  This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter and determined there was no impairment as of that date. The Company is not aware of any additional triggering events.\n\n## DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nThe Company recognizes definite-lived intangible asset balances in conjunction with business combinations, with amounts being recorded at their respective fair values upon the closing of a transaction. Subsequent to the closing of a business combination, the Company evaluates and books adjustments, as applicable, to the preliminary amounts recorded over the relevant measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n\nDefinite-liv ed  intangible  assets  consist  of  customer  relationships,  patents  and  technology ,  trademarks,  and  other  intangibles  and  are  amortized  over  their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to 20 years.\n\n58 Honeywell International Inc.",

      "question": "How does the $4,951 million in private equity funds held by LMT compare to UPS's use of valuation models in assessing financial instrument sensitivity, given that private equity funds are valued using unobservable inputs in NAV models?",
      "answer": "LMT reports $4,951 million in private equity funds as of December 31, 2023, which are valued using NAV models that rely on unobservable inputs. These inputs cannot be corroborated with market data, indicating a high degree of estimation uncertainty. Meanwhile, UPS discloses its use of valuation models to assess the sensitivity of financial instruments to market risks like interest rates and equity prices. While LMT\u2019s private equity fund valuations depend heavily on internal models with opaque assumptions, UPS applies valuation models in a different context\u2014quantifying exposure to market shifts. This highlights a contrast in how each company engages with valuation models: LMT uses them for asset measurement with limited transparency, while UPS uses them for risk assessment with sensitivity analysis.",

      "answer": "FDX's pension plan assumptions explicitly include employee turnover, which directly affects the financial volatility of its defined benefit plans under market-to-market (MTM) accounting. Inflationary pressures, as seen in QCOM's filing, can increase employee compensation costs and lead to attrition if wages do not keep pace. This implies that FDX could face increased pension liabilities and financial volatility if inflationary pressures lead to higher employee turnover. Separately, CAT acknowledges that inflationary pressures can significantly affect its operational costs, particularly through increased material and labor expenses, which could reduce profitability and impact its financial condition. While both companies are exposed to inflationary pressures, FDX's exposure is amplified through pension liabilities sensitive to turnover, whereas CAT's exposure manifests more directly through operational cost increases.",

Upon closing of the transaction, Emerson owned 55 percent of the outstanding shares of AspenTech common stock (on a fully diluted basis). AspenTech and its subsidiaries now operate under Heritage AspenTech's prev ious name 'Aspen Technology, Inc.' and AspenTech common stock is traded on NASDAQ under AspenTech's previous stock ticker symbol 'AZPN.' Due to the timing of the acquisition, the results for the first half of fiscal 2022 do not include the results of Heritage AspenTech.\n\nSee Notes 4, 5 and 8 and Item 1A - \"Risk Factors\" for further information on acquisitions and div estitures.\n\n## COST OF SALES\n\nCost of sales for 2024 were $8,607, an increase of $869 compared with $7,738 in 2023, reflecting the impact of higher v olume and the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition. Gross profit was $8,885 in 2024 compared to $7,427 in 2023, while gross margin increased 1.8 percentage points to 50.8 percent, reflecting the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition and higher price partially offset by the impact from acquisition-related inv entory step-up amortization of $231, which negativ ely impacted margins by approximately 1.3 percentage points.\n\nCost of sales for 2023 were $7,738, an increase of $240 compared with $7,498 in 2022. Gross profit was $7,427 in 2023 compared to $6,306 in 2022, while gross margin increased 3.3 percentage points to 49.0 percent due to fav orable price less net material inflation, the impact of the Heritage AspenTech acquisition which benefited margins by 0.6 percentage points, and fav orable mix.\n\n## SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $5,142 in 2024 increased $956 compared with 2023 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.8 percentage points to 29.4 percent, reflecting the impact of the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition, partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\nSG&amp;A expenses of $4,186 in 2023 increased $572 compared with 2022 and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased 1.4 percentage points to 27.6 percent, reflecting the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and higher stock compensation expense of $125, of which $75 related to Emerson stock plans due to a higher share price and $50 was attributable to AspenTech stock plans. These items were partially offset by strong operating lev erage on higher sales.\n\n## SALE OF COPELAND NOTE RECEIVABLE AND EQUITY INTEREST\n\nOn June 6, 2024, the Company entered into definitiv e agreements to sell its 40 percent non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland to priv ate equity funds managed by Blackstone for $1.5 billion and its note receiv able to Copeland for $1.9 billion, and the transactions were subsequently completed in August 2024. Upon entering into the note agreement, the Company recorded a pretax loss in continuing operations of $279 ($217 after-tax, $0.38 per share) to adjust the carrying v alue of the note to $1.9 billion to reflect the transaction price, while the Company recognized a gain of $539 ($435 after-tax) in discontinued operations upon the sale of the common equity interest. In addition, the equity method losses related to the Company's non-controlling common equity interest in Copeland, which were reported since May 2023 in Other deductions, net, hav e been reclassified and are now reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\n\n## GAIN ON SUBORDINATED INTEREST\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company receiv ed a distribution of $438 related to its subordinated interest in Vertiv  (in total, a pretax gain of $453 was recognized in the first quarter of 2022, $358 after-tax, $0.60 per share) and receiv ed the remaining $15 related to the pretax gain in the first quarter of 2023. In 2023, the Company receiv ed additional distributions totaling $161 ($122 after-tax, $0.21 per share) and in 2024, receiv ed its final distribution of $79 ($60 after-tax, $0.10 per share).\n\n## OTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET\n\nOther deductions, net were $1,434 in 2024, an increase of $928 compared with 2023. The current year included intangibles amortization related to the Test &amp; Measurement acquisition of $560, while restructuring costs increased by $156 and acquisition/div estiture costs increased by $27. The Company also incurred div estiture losses of $48 ($50 after-tax, $0.09 per share).\n\nOther deductions, net were $506 in 2023, a decrease of $13 compared with 2022, and included higher intangibles amortization of $146 primarily related to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition and an unfav orable impact from foreign currency transactions of $112 reflecting losses in the current year compared to gains in the prior year.

AspenTech, as defined in Note 4, operates as a separate publicly traded company and has v arious stock-based compensation plans, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units, which are settled in their own common stock and are accounted for as equity awards. Restricted stock units and performance stock units generally v est ov er three years. In fiscal 2023 and 2024, the Company granted performance stock units with both a performance and serv ice condition. The performance condition relates to the attainment of predefined goals based on annual contract v alue and free cash flows. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the probability that the threshold performance goals will be achiev ed, if at all, and the anticipated lev el of attainment to determine the amount of compensation expense to record in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Option awards hav e been granted with an exercise price equal to the market closing price of AspenTech's stock on the trading day prior to the grant date. These options generally v est ov er four years and expire within sev en years or ten years of grant. AspenTech's policy is to issue new shares upon the exercise of v ested stock awards.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement between Emerson and Heritage AspenTech, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock, whether vested or unvested, that was unexercised as of immediately prior to the closing date was conv erted into an option to acquire shares of AspenTech. Each conv erted option is subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original option. In addition, each outstanding award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of Heritage AspenTech common stock that were unv ested as of immediately prior to the closing date was conv erted into an award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of AspenTech. Each conv erted restricted stock unit is also subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the original restricted stock unit.\n\nASC 805 required the Company to determine the fair v alue of the AspenTech share-based payment awards related to the replacement of the Heritage AspenTech share-based payment awards, and allocate the total fair v alue based on the serv ices that are attributable to the pre- and post-combination serv ice periods, respectiv ely. The portion that is attributable to the pre-combination serv ice period was considered part of the consideration transferred for Heritage AspenTech and included as part of the purchase price. The portion that is attributable to the post-combination serv ice period is recognized as stock-based compensation expense in the post-combination consolidated financial statements ov er the remaining requisite serv ice period.\n\n## AspenTech Stock Options\n\nAspenTech utilizes the Black-Scholes option v aluation model for estimating the fair v alue of options granted. The Black-Scholes option v aluation model incorporates assumptions regarding expected stock price v olatility, the expected life of the option, the risk-free interest rate, div idend yield and the market value of AspenTech's common stock. The expected stock price v olatility is determined based on AspenTech's stock's historic prices ov er a period commensurate with the expected life of the award. The expected life of an option represents the period for which options are expected to be outstanding as determined by historic option exercises and cancellations. The risk-free",

V ested stock units are payable to directors upon their termination of service from our Board, ex cept that directors who have satisfied the stock ownership g uidelines may elect to have payment of awards made after January 1, 2018 (tog ether with any dividend equivalents thereon) made on the first business day of April following  the one-year anniversary of the g rant. (1)\n\nThe shares represent annual incentive bonuses and Long -Term Incentive Performance (L TIP) payments earned and voluntarily deferred by employees. The deferred amounts are payable under the Deferred Management Incentive Compensation Plan (DMICP). Deferred amounts are credited as phantom stock units at the closing  price of our stock on the date the deferral is effective. Amounts equal to our dividend are credited as stock units at the time we pay a dividend. Following  termination of employment, a number of shares of stock equal to the number of stock units credited to the employee's DMICP account are distributed to the employee. There is no discount or value transfer on the stock distributed. Distributions may be made from newly issued shares or shares purchased on the open market. Historically, all distributions have come from shares held in a separate trust and, therefore, do not further dilute our common shares outstanding . Because the DMICP shares are outstanding , they should be included in the denominator (and not the numerator) of a dilution calculation. (2)\n\n## ITEM 13.

      "answer": "UNP values its limited partnership investments in real estate funds using net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient due to the lack of readily observable inputs, which places them outside the Level 1, 2, or 3 fair value hierarchy classifications. These investments are part of a broader category of alternative investments that include private equity and private debt funds. Similarly, GD reports its real estate fund investments as part of its Level 3 assets, indicating unobservable market inputs were used. In 2023, GD reported $13 million in real estate funds, which experienced a $1 million realized gain during the year. Unlike GD, which explicitly discloses realized gains and losses on real estate funds, UNP does not report specific realized gains or losses on its real estate fund holdings, focusing instead on NAV-based valuation.",

These investments are not actively traded and require significant auditor judgment. In contrast, General Dynamics includes Level 1 assets (commingled equity and fixed-income funds) that are valued using quoted prices from market exchanges and are considered actively traded, though they also use NAV as a practical expedient in some cases. This indicates that while both companies use NAV for pension asset disclosures, the nature of the assets and their liquidity differs significantly, with GD\u2019s Level 1 assets being more transparent and market-driven compared to UPS\u2019s more subjective and illiquid NAV-based valuations.",
