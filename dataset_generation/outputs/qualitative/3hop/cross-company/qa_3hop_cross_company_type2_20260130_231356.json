Our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our System's ability  to meet ex pectations for safe food and on our ability  to manage the potential impact on M cDonald's of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future, including in the supply chain, restaurants or delivery. Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources aimed at ensuring that our customers enjoy safe food products, including as our menu and service model evolve. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, have occurred within the food industry and our System from time to time (including the E. coli event in the U.S. in October 2024) and could occur in the future. Instances of food tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial results.\n\n## If we do not effectively manage our real estate portfolio, our operating results may be negatively impacted.\n\nWe have significant real estate operations, primarily in connection with our restaurant business. We generally own or secure a long-term lease on the land and building for conventional franchised and Company-owned and operated restaurant sites. We seek to identify and develop restaurant locations that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential. A s we generally secure long-term real estate interests for our restaurants, we have limited flex ibility  to quickly  alter our real estate portfolio. The competitiv e business landscape continues to ev olv e in light of changing business trends, consumer preferences, trade area demographics, consumer use of digital, delivery and drive thru, local competitive positions and other economic factors. If our restaurants are not located in desirable locations, or if we do not evolve in response to these factors, it could adversely affect Systemwide sales and profitability.\n\nOur real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate operations are also impacted by a variety of other factors, including governmental regulations, insurance, zoning, tax and eminent domain laws, interest rate levels, the cost of financing, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities, or other factors beyond our control. A  significant change in real estate values, or an increase in costs as a result of any of these factors, could adversely affect our operating results.\n\n## Information technology system failures or interruptions, or breaches of network security, may impact our operations or cause reputational harm.\n\nWe are increasingly reliant upon technology systems, such as point-of-sale, that support our business operations, including our digital and delivery solutions, and technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration with affiliated entities, customers, employees, franchisees, suppliers, service providers or other independent third parties to conduct our business, whether developed and maintained by us or provided by third parties. A ny failure or interruption of these systems could significantly impact our or our franchisees' operations, or our customers' experiences and perceptions. In addition, the artificial intelligence tools we are incorporating into certain aspects of our business may not generate the intended efficiencies and may impact our business results.\n\nSecurity incidents and breaches have from time to time occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the systems of the parties with whom we communicate or collaborate (including franchisees) or the systems of third-party providers. These may include such things as unauthorized access, phishing attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, computer viruses, deepfakes and other malicious uses of artificial intelligence, introduction of malware or ransomware, other disruptive problems caused by hackers or unintentional events. Certain of these technology systems contain personal, confidential, financial and other information of our customers, employees, franchisees and their employees, suppliers and other third parties, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. Despite response procedures and measures in place in the event an incident occurs, it could result in disruptions, shutdowns, or a security breach including the theft or unauthorized disclosure of certain of the above-described information. The actual or alleged occurrence of any of these types of incidents could result in mitigation costs, reputational damage, adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk, including administrative fines, criminal or civil penalties or civil liabilities.\n\nDespite the implementation of business continuity measures, any of these technology systems could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Certain technology systems may also become vulnerable, unreliable or inefficient in cases where technology vendors limit or terminate product support and/or maintenance. Our increasing reliance on third-party systems also subjects us to risks faced by those third-party businesses, including operational, security and credit risks. Further, the technology systems of third parties upon which we rely to conduct our business could be compromised in a manner that adversely affects us and our technology systems, information and business continuity. If technology systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, or if business continuity or disaster recovery plans were not effective, and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we could experience an interruption in our or our franchisees' operations. While we maintain insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\n## LEGAL AND REG ULATORY\n\n## Increasing regulatory and legal complexity may adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\nOur regulatory and legal environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways. M any of our markets are subject to increasing, conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations involving, among other matters, restaurant operations, product packaging, marketing, use of information technology systems, the nutritional and allergen content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices. Compliance efforts with those regulations may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers. We also are subject to increasing public focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, on environmental, social responsibility and corporate governance matters. Our success depends in part on our",

If we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives, or, in the event we undertake large acquisitions, integrations, and divestitures, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. In the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\n## Our investments to transform and enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected results.\n\nOur long-term business objectives depend on the successful execution of our strategies. We continue to build upon our investments in development, technology, digital engagement, and delivery in order to transform and enhance the customer experience. As part of these investments, we continue to focus on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, mobile order and payment systems, and enhancement of our technologies. We also continue to expand and refine our mobile ordering process. If these customer experience initiatives are not successfully executed or do not generate expected results, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our financial results may suffer. It is also possible that the greater allocation of time and resources to these customer experience initiatives versus other organizational priorities could negatively impact other areas of our business, or that we will fail to achieve optimal allocation of resources, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.\n\n## Evolving consumer preferences and tastes, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, may adversely affect our business.\n\nOur continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers. Our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outside-the-home food and beverages (such as a reduction in discretionary spending); lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the Starbucks brand), and platforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs, and our delivery services initiatives); or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced. In addition, some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar, and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. An unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether or not accurate, imposition of additional tax es on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and materially harm our business and results of operations. Changes in diet (whether due to changes in consumer behavior and eating habits, use of weight-loss drugs, or other factors) could also influence the demand for our offerings and materially harm our business and results of operations.

LOW highlights its reliance on vendors to meet compliance standards and the increased risk when sourcing from unfamiliar manufacturers, especially in the context of supply chain disruptions like those caused by the pandemic. NKE discusses its vulnerability to supply chain interruptions due to extreme weather events and public health emergencies, noting the difficulty in replacing capacity at key manufacturing locations.

      "question": "How do BKNG, LOW, and MCD each allocate their short-term investments in Certificates of Deposit, and what does this reveal about their respective liquidity strategies in 2023?",
      "answer": "BKNG held $60 million in Certificates of Deposit as part of its cash equivalents in 2023, indicating a minimal allocation to this form of short-term investment. LOW reported $42 million in Certificates of Deposit under short-term investments, showing a moderate emphasis on this asset class. MCD held $4.0 billion in Certificates of Deposit as part of its $4.6 billion in Cash and equivalents, revealing a significant reliance on CDs for liquidity. This comparison suggests that MCD prioritizes CDs as a core liquidity vehicle, while LOW uses them more selectively, and BKNG allocates only marginally to CDs in its cash management strategy.",

General Motors highlights the complexity of complying with global data protection laws like the GDPR and CCPA, and the increasing cost and operational burden of regulatory compliance, especially in the automotive technology space. Lowe's focuses on the risks associated with third-party vendors and customer-facing systems, and the potential for reputational damage from cybersecurity incidents, particularly in the retail environment. Together, these approaches show that while all three companies recognize the growing importance of data protection regulations, they differ in emphasis\u2014Amazon on internal governance and control, GM on regulatory complexity, and Lowe\u2019s on external-facing vulnerabilities.",

      "answer": "Amazon's $11.8 billion valuation gain from its equity investment in Rivian and its 18% ownership stake highlight its strategic commitment to electric vehicles through a key market player. GM emphasizes its ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of electric vehicles and the importance of timely product development to attract consumers, signaling a major traditional automaker's pivot toward electrification. Tesla, with its in-house design and engineering capabilities, has significantly reduced product development time and optimized vehicle performance through innovations like integrated battery-body structures. Together, these perspectives show Amazon backing a disruptive EV startup, GM transitioning legacy operations toward electric platforms, and Tesla maintaining a technological edge through vertical integration and innovation.",

          "chunk_text": "\nIncluded in other income (expense), net in 2021 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain of $11.8 billion from our equity investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc. ('Rivian'). Our investment in Rivian's preferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, prior to Rivian's initial public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2021, we held 158 million shares of Rivian's Class A common stock, representing an approximate 18% ownership interest, and an approximate 16% voting interest. We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles, and one of our employees serving on Rivian's board of directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, and the 2021 valuation gain is primarily comprised of the gain recognized upon the initial public offering, and also includes subsequent changes in fair value through December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our equity investment in Rivian had a fair value of $15.6 billion, which reflects a discount for lack of marketability until Q1 2022 of approximately $800 million due to regulatory sales restrictions, and is included in 'Marketable securities' on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nSummarized financial information of Rivian as disclosed in its SEC filings is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact. Forward-looking  statements  represent  our  current  judgment  about  possible  future  events  and  are  often  identified  by  words  like 'aim,'  'anticipate,'  'appears,'  'approximately,'  'believe,'  'continue,'  'could,'  'designed,'  'effect,'  'estimate,'  'evaluate,' 'expect,'  'forecast,'  'goal,'  'initiative,'  'intend,'  'may,'  'objective,'  'outlook,'  'plan,'  'potential,'  'priorities,'  'project,' 'pursue,'  'seek,'  'should,'  'target,'  'when,'  'will,'  'would,'  or  the  negative  of  any  of  those  words  or  similar  expressions.  In making these statements, we rely on assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these  judgments  are  reasonable,  but  these  statements  are  not  guarantees  of  any  future  events  or  financial  results,  and  our  actual results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors, which may be  revised  or  supplemented  in  subsequent  reports  we  file  with  the  SEC,  include,  among  others,  the  following:  (1)  our  ability  to deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry; (2) our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models, including electric vehicles, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers; (3) our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of electric vehicles that will help drive consumer adoption; (4) the success of our current line of full-size SUVs and full-size pickup trucks; (5) our highly competitive industry, which has been historically characterized by excess manufacturing capacity and the use of  incentives,  and  the  introduction  of  new  and  improved  vehicle  models  by  our  competitors;  (6)  the  unique  technological, operational,  regulatory  and  competitive  risks  related  to  the  timing  and  commercialization  of  autonomous  vehicles;  (7)  risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, our transition to electric vehicles and the  potential  increased  impacts  of  severe  weather  events;  (8)  global  automobile  market  sales  volume,  which  can  be  volatile;  (9) prices  and  uncertain  availability  of  raw  materials  and  commodities  used  by  us  and  our  suppliers,  and  instability  in  logistics  and related costs; (10) our business in China, which is subject to unique operational, competitive, regulatory and economic risks; (11) the success of our ongoing strategic business relationships and of our joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which we may have limited control; (12) the international scale and footprint of our operations, which exposes us to a variety of unique  political,  economic,  competitive  and  regulatory  risks,  including  the  risk  of  changes  in  government  leadership  and  laws (including  labor,  trade,  tax  and  other  laws),  political  uncertainty  or  instability  and  economic  tensions  between  governments  and changes in international trade policies, new barriers to entry and changes to or withdrawals from free trade agreements, changes in foreign  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates,  economic  downturns  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  differing  local  product preferences and product requirements, changes to and compliance with U.S. and foreign countries' export controls and economic sanctions,  differing  labor  regulations,  requirements  and  union  relationships,  differing  dealer  and  franchise  regulations  and relationships,  difficulties  in  obtaining  financing  in  foreign  countries,  and  public  health  crises,  including  the  occurrence  of  a contagious disease or illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; (13) any significant disruption, including any work stoppages, at any of our manufacturing facilities; (14) the ability of our suppliers to deliver parts, systems and components without disruption and at such times to allow us to meet production schedules; (15) the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; (16) the success of any restructurings or  other  cost  reduction  actions;  (17)  the  possibility  that  competitors  may  independently  develop  products  and  services  similar  to ours, or that our intellectual property rights are not sufficient to prevent competitors from developing or selling those products or services; (18) our ability to manage risks related to security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology systems and networked products, including connected vehicles and in-vehicle systems; (19) our ability to comply with increasingly complex, restrictive and punitive regulations relating to our enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing and security of the Personal  Identifiable  Information  of  our  customers,  employees,  or  suppliers;  (20)  our  ability  to  comply  with  extensive  laws, regulations  and  policies  applicable  to  our  operations  and  products,  including  those  relating  to  fuel  economy,  emissions  and autonomous vehicles; (21) costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations; (22) the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services; (23) any additional tax expense or exposure; (24) our continued ability to develop captive financing capability through GM Financial; and (25) any significant increase in our pension funding requirements. For a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except where we are expressly required to do so by law.\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *",

          "chunk_text": "## Design and Engineering\n\n## Automotive\n\nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. Our team has core competencies in computer aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations, which reduces the product development time of new models. Additionally, our team has expertise in selecting and working with a range of materials for our vehicles to balance performance, cost and durability in ways that are best suited for our vehicles' target demographics and utility. We have also used our capabilities to achieve complex engineering feats in stamping, casting and thermal systems, and are currently developing designs that integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost characteristics.\n\nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and production for particular markets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase our capabilities, particularly in the areas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design and manufacture our energy generation and storage products and components. We also employ our design and engineering expertise to customize solutions including our energy storage products, solar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their specific needs. We have developed software that simplifies and expedites the design process, as well as mounting hardware that facilitates solar panel installation.\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\nHistorically, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our products, and we believe we will continue to do so. Such media coverage and word of mouth are the current primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs.\n\n## Automotive\n\n## Direct Sales\n\nOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some jurisdictions, we also have galleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback.\n\nWe reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our current sales channels. Sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time.\n\n## Used Vehicle Sales\n\nOur used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer's existing Tesla or non-Tesla vehicle with the sale of a new or used Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third parties. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns.\n\n## Public Charging\n\nWe have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where possible, we co-locate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power. Supercharger stations are typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable and ubiquitous charging with convenient, minimal stops. Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs.\n\nWe also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting employees, to offer additional charging options for our customers. These Destination Charging and workplace locations deploy Tesla Wall Connectors to provide charging to Tesla vehicle owners who patronize or are employed at their businesses. We also work with single-family homeowners and multi-family residential entities to deploy home charging solutions.",

      "question": "How do HD, LOW, and SBUX each utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage financial risk, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to interest rate exposure in the consumer discretionary sector?",
      "answer": "HD amended its interest rate swap agreements to transition from LIBOR to SOFR in fiscal 2023 without material impact, and it also settled forward-starting swaps related to forecasted debt issuances, with unamortized losses being amortized over the life of the notes. LOW uses interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on certain debt, but notes that nearly all its long-term debt is fixed-rate and carried at amortized cost, making interest rate risk exposure not material to its financial condition. SBUX employs interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances, as part of a broader market risk management policy that includes commodity and foreign exchange risk. This comparative analysis shows that while all three companies use interest rate swaps, HD focuses on benchmark rate transition and historical hedge amortization, LOW minimizes exposure through fixed-rate debt structure, and SBUX proactively hedges against future interest rate movements in line with planned financings.",

      "question": "How do AMZN, MCD, and SBUX each approach the protection and strategic value of copyrights, and what does this reveal about their respective brand management and competitive differentiation strategies in the consumer discretionary sector?",
      "answer": "AMZN emphasizes the criticality of copyrights, along with other intellectual property, to its business success, noting that it actively registers and protects these rights globally to maintain competitive advantage. MCD highlights its dependence on trademarks and copyrights for brand awareness and development, but also expresses risk around potential infringement and the cost of enforcement, especially in evolving digital environments. SBUX explicitly states ownership of numerous copyrights for product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics, and training materials, underscoring the importance of brand identity and in-store experience in its competitive differentiation. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies view copyrights as strategically important, their approaches vary from proactive global registration (AMZN), to brand-focused but risk-aware enforcement (MCD), to identity-driven ownership (SBUX), reflecting their broader brand and operational strategies.",

T he VP , C IS has prim ary responsibility for im plem enting and overseeing our enterprise-wide cybersecurity strategy, policy, architecture and processes. W e use various tools and m ethodologies to identify and manage cybersecurity risk, including risk assessm ents and a vulnerability m anagem ent program  that includes periodic penetration testing. W e have a third-party cyber risk managem ent program  that conducts assessm ents on third parties who integrate with our data, network, system s and applications. These tools and m ethodologies inform  our rem ediation activities, which are tracked and reported to senior m anagem ent.\n\nI n addition, our internal audit function periodically conducts independent testing of the overall operations of our cybersecurity program  and supporting control fram eworks, and reports the results to the Audit &amp; F inance C om m ittee. W e also engage third parties to assess our cybersecurity program  m aturity and to perform  audits of portions of our cybersecurity control environm ent based on risk or where necessary to ensure regulatory com pliance.\n\nOur cybersecurity team  m eets frequently to m onitor the prevention, detection, m itigation and rem ediation of cybersecurity threats and incidents. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, we have an incident response plan that governs our im m ediate response including detection, escalation, assessm ent, m anagem ent and rem ediation. As part of incident response, the cybersecurity team  will also coordinate with external advisors and other key stakeholders as needed. The cybersecurity team  routinely tests this plan across the organization to validate the procedures for appropriately escalating potentially m aterial cybersecurity risks and incidents. Also, we provide an annual, m andatory cybersecurity training program  for em ployees that is intended to help them  understand cybersecurity risks and com ply with our cybersecurity policies.\n\n## Board Oversight\n\nOur Board of D irectors has ultim ate oversight of cybersecurity risk as part of its risk m anagem ent oversight responsibilities, including with respect to cybersecurity risk priorities, resource allocation and oversight structures. T he Board of D irectors receives an update on our cybersecurity program  on an annual basis, or m ore frequently as determ ined to be necessary or advisable. The Board of D irectors has delegated risk m anagem ent oversight responsibility for inform ation security and data protection to the Audit &amp; F inance C om m ittee, which regularly reviews our cybersecurity program  and related m atters with m anagem ent and reports to the Board of D irectors. T opics discussed at the board level include our approach to cybersecurity risk m anagem ent, key initiatives, the threat landscape and recent developm ents and trends. T he Board of D irectors is aware of the critical nature of managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats and is actively engaged in our cybersecurity risk m anagem ent strategy.\n\n## Risks from Cybersecurity Threats\n\nEven though, to date, cybersecurity risks have not m aterially affected our business or our results of operations, we face num erous and evolving cybersecurity threats.

CYBERSECURITY\n\n## Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, ex tortion, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws.\n\nIdentifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity risks related to our business, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach including third party assessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews. To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we, among other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration testing using external third-party tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability reporting, conduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including our consumer products) and implement appropriate changes.\n\nWe have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected stages: 1) preparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and recovery, and 4) post-incident analysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity.\n\nSecurity events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents are evaluated to determine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact.\n\nWe also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals then collaborate with technical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form detection, mitigation and remediation strategies.\n\nAs part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and compliance with applicable practices and standards. As of 2024, our Information Security Management System has been certified to conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.\n\nOur risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third parties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service providers. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated when determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers and potential fourth-party risks when handling and/or processing our employee, business or customer data. In addition to new vendor onboarding, we perform risk management during third-party cybersecurity compromise incidents to identify and mitigate risks to us from third-party incidents.\n\nWe describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the heading 'Our information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences' included as part of our risk factor disclosures at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Cybersecurity Governance\n\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. Our Audit Committee is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. Members of the Audit Committee receive updates on a quarterly basis from senior management, including leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity. This includes existing and new cybersecurity risks, status on how management is addressing and/or mitigating those risks, cybersecurity and data privacy incidents (if any) and status on key information security initiatives. Our Board members also engage in ad hoc conversations with management on cybersecurity-related news events and discuss any updates to our cybersecurity risk management and strategy programs.",

      "question": "How do BKNG, MCD, and TSLA each approach the protection and utilization of copyrights, and what does this reveal about their respective strategies in leveraging intellectual property to support their business models?",
      "answer": "BKNG emphasizes the importance of copyrights as part of its broader intellectual property portfolio, noting that it relies on trademarks, copyrights, patents, and trade secrets to support its business. The company has filed applications for protection in the U.S. and other jurisdictions and holds issued patents in several jurisdictions. MCD highlights its reliance on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, and patents to protect its brand and branded products, noting the challenges of protecting intellectual property globally and the potential for costly litigation over infringement claims. TSLA places a strong emphasis on protecting innovations through intellectual property rights, including copyrights, and has adopted a patent policy that includes a pledge not to sue parties acting in good faith for using its electric vehicle patents, aiming to encourage broader adoption of electric vehicles. This reveals that BKNG focuses on a broad and legally secured IP portfolio, MCD prioritizes brand protection amid global operational complexity, and TSLA seeks to drive industry-wide innovation through open IP policy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BKNG \u2192 Copyrights: The company explicitly states that it relies on copyrights as part of its intellectual property strategy and has filed applications in multiple jurisdictions, holding issued patents in several locations.",
        "Hop 2: MCD \u2192 Copyrights: MCD notes that it uses a combination of trademarks, copyrights, and other IP rights to protect its brand and branded products, while acknowledging the cost and complexity of global IP enforcement.",
        "Hop 3: TSLA \u2192 Copyrights: TSLA emphasizes protecting innovations through copyrights and patents, and has adopted a unique IP policy where it pledges not to sue in good faith users of its electric vehicle patents to promote broader industry adoption."

The Home Depot applies for copyrights as part of its brand protection efforts, particularly for its proprietary brands like Hampton Bay and Husky, indicating a focus on product-specific branding and merchandising. Nike holds copyrights for its designs, graphics, and software applications, underscoring a strategic approach to protecting both physical and digital innovations.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Competition\n\nOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including onpremises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers' ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth's most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,608,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for personnel across other parts of our business.\n\nAs we strive to be Earth's best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and develop the best talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (funded education for hourly employees) and the Amazon Technical Academy (software development engineer training). We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.",

We also provide tool and equipment rentals at over 1,400 locations across the U.S. and Canada, providing value and convenience for both Pros and consumers. To improve the customer experience and continue to grow this differentiated service offering, we are continuing to invest in more locations, more tools, and better technology.\n\nSourcing and Quality Assurance. We maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innovative products directly from manufacturers in the U.S. and around the world. During fiscal 2021, in addition to our U.S. sourcing operations, we maintained sourcing offices in Mexico, Canada, China, India, Vietnam and Europe. To ensure that suppliers adhere to our high standards of social and environmental responsibility, we also have a global responsible sourcing program. Under our supplier contracts, our suppliers are obligated to ensure that their products comply with applicable international, federal, state and local laws. These contracts also require compliance with our responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, health and safety, environment, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. To drive accountability with our suppliers, our standard supplier buying agreement includes a factory audit right related to these standards, and we conduct factory audits and compliance visits with our suppliers of private branded and direct import products. Our 2021 Responsible Sourcing Report, available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility/sourcing-responsibility, provides more information about this program. In addition, we have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to establishing criteria and overseeing compliance with safety, quality and performance standards for our private branded products.\n\nIntellectual Property. Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, ecommerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business, including our proprietary brands such as HDX , Husky , Hampton Bay , Home Decorators Collection , Glacier Bay , Vigoro , Everbilt and Lifeproof . The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nWe also maintain patent portfolios relating to our business operations, retail services and products and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our business. Patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential to our business. We continuously assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within The Home Depot's portfolio of proprietary and exclusive brands.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nOur industry is highly competitive, very fragmented, and evolving. As a result, we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer bases, and service providers, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online. These competitors include a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO distributors, home d\u00e9cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. The internet facilitates competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the level of competition we face.\n\nWe compete primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, product availability and assortment, and delivery options, both in-store and online. We also compete based on store location and appearance, presentation of merchandise, and ease of shopping experience. Furthermore, with respect to delivery options, customers are increasingly seeking faster and/or guaranteed delivery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or convenient pickup options, including curbside pickup. Our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including the success of our supply chain investments, described more fully under 'Our Supply Chain' below.\n\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, and the lowest volume occurs either during our first or fourth fiscal quarter.",

If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability.\n\nOur international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or \"FCPA\", and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. We source a significant portion of our products from, and have important consumer markets, outside of the United States. We have an ethics and compliance program to address compliance with the FCPA and similar laws by us, our employees, agents, suppliers and other partners. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information on risks relating to our international operations.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment, including adidas, Anta, ASICS, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, Puma, Under Armour and V.F. Corporation, among others. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.\n\nNIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. Important aspects of competition in this industry are:\n\n- Product attributes such as quality; performance and reliability; new product style, design, innovation and development; as well as consumer price/value.\n- Consumer connection, engagement and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing, promotion and digital experiences; social media interaction; customer support and service; identification with prominent and influential athletes, influencers, public figures, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics.\n- Effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and on digital platforms.\n\nWe believe that we are competitive in all of these areas.\n\n## TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS\n\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success and our competitive position. We strategically pursue available protections of these rights and vigorously protect them against third-party theft and infringement.\n\nWe use trademarks on nearly all of our products and packaging, and in our marketing materials, and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh Design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 190 jurisdictions worldwide. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we use in marketing our products. We own common law rights in the trade dress of several distinctive shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have sought and obtained trademark registrations.\n\nWe have copyright protection in our designs, graphics, software applications, digital goods and other original works. When appropriate, we also obtain registered copyrights.\n\nWe file for, own and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility and design patents protecting components, technologies, materials, manufacturing techniques, features, functionality, and industrial designs used in and for the manufacture of various athletic, performance, and leisure footwear and apparel, including physical and digital versions thereof, athletic equipment, and digital devices, and related software applications. These patents expire at various times.\n\nWe believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing and is supported and protected by our intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, utility and design patents, copyrights, and trade secrets, among others.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 5",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nWe  have  listed  below  the  most  material  risk  factors  applicable  to  us.  These  risk  factors  are  not  necessarily  in  the  order  of importance or probability of occurrence:\n\n## Risks related to our competition and strategy\n\nIf we do not deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry, our business could suffer. We believe that the automotive industry will  continue  to  experience  significant  change  in  the  coming  years,  particularly  as  traditional  automotive  original  equipment manufacturers shift resources to the development of EVs. In addition to our traditional competitors, we must also be responsive to the  entrance  of  start-ups  and  other  non-traditional  competitors  in  the  automotive  industry.  These  new  competitors,  as  well  as established  industry  participants,  are  disrupting  the  historic  business  model  of  our  industry  through  the  introduction  of  new technologies, products, services, direct-to-consumer  sales channels, methods  of  transportation  and  vehicle  ownership.  To successfully execute our long-term strategy, we must continue to develop new products and services, including products and services that  are  outside  of  our  historically  core  ICE  business,  such  as  EVs  and A Vs, software-enabled connected services and other new businesses.\n\nOur vehicles and connected services increasingly rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and complex. The process of designing and developing new technology, products and services is costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit the best talent. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained, if costs of capital increased significantly, or if our ability to raise capital is challenged relative to our peers, in each case including as a result of any constraints  on  lending  due  to  concerns  about  climate  change,  our  ability  to  execute  on  our  strategic  plans  could  be  adversely affected. Further, the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our strategic plans.\n\nThere can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way, if at all, that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do, or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage. Further, if we are unable to prevent or effectively remedy errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects in our software and hardware, or fail to deploy updates to our software properly, or if we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed.\n\nOur ability  to  maintain  profitability  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  timely  fund  and  introduce  new  and  improved  vehicle models, including EVs, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers. We operate in a very competitive industry with market  participants  routinely  introducing  new  and  improved  vehicle  models  and  features  designed  to  meet  rapidly  evolving consumer expectations. Producing new and improved vehicle models, including EVs, that preserve our reputation for designing, building and selling safe, high-quality cars, trucks and SUVs is critical to our long-term profitability. Successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability. The new vehicle development process can take two years or more, and a number of factors may lengthen that time period. Because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers' acceptance of new vehicle designs, including competitors' product introductions, technological innovations, fuel prices, general economic conditions, regulatory developments, transportation infrastructure and changes in quality, safety, reliability and styling demands and preferences, an initial product concept or design may not result in a saleable vehicle or a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable. Our high proportion of fixed costs, both due to our significant investment in property, plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements, which limit our flexibility  to  adjust  personnel  costs  to  changes  in  demands  for  our  products,  may  further  exacerbate  the  risks  associated  with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles.\n\nOur  long-term  strategy  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  profitably  deliver  a  broad  portfolio  of  EVs. The  production  and profitable sale of EVs has become increasingly important to our long-term business as we accelerate our transition to an all-electric future.  In  2021,  we  increased  our  commitment to investments in EV and AV technologies to more than $35.0 billion from 2020 through 2025, with plans to launch more than 30 new EV models globally across several price points in that timeframe. Our EV strategy  is  dependent  on  our  ability  to  deliver  a  broad  portfolio  of  high-quality  EVs  that  are  competitive  and  meet  consumer demands; reduce the costs associated with the manufacture of EVs, particularly with respect to batteries; increase vehicle range and the energy density of our batteries; license and monetize our proprietary platforms and related innovations; successfully invest in new technologies relative to our peers; develop new software and services; and leverage our scale, manufacturing capabilities and synergies with existing ICE vehicles.",

Our Installed Sales model, which separates selling and project administration tasks, allows our sales associates to focus on project selling, while project managers ensure that the details related to installing the products are efficiently executed.  Installed Sales, which includes both product and labor, accounted for approximately 5% of total sales in fiscal 2021.\n\n## Lowe's Protection Plans and Repair Services\n\nWe offer extended protection plans for various products within the Appliances, Kitchens &amp; Bath, D\u00e9cor, Millwork, Rough Plumbing, Electrical, Seasonal &amp; Outdoor Living, Tools, and Hardware categories. These protection plans provide customers with product protection that enhances or extends coverage offered by the manufacturer's warranty and provides additional customerfriendly benefits that go beyond the scope of a manufacturer's warranty. The protection plans provide in-warranty benefits and outof-warranty repair services for major appliances, outdoor power equipment, tools, grills, fireplaces, air conditioners, water heaters, and other eligible products through our stores or in the home through the Lowe's Authorized Service Repair Network. Our contact centers take customers' calls, assesses the problems, and facilitates resolutions, making after-sales service easier for our customers by managing the entire process.\n\n## Selling Channels\n\nWe are continuing to enhance our omnichannel capabilities, which allows our customers to move from channel to channel with simple and seamless transitions even within the same transaction. For example, for many projects, more than half of our customers conduct research online before making an in-store purchase. For purchases made on Lowes.com, customers may pick up their purchase in-store at the customer service desk, curbside pick-up, or touchless lockers, or have their purchase delivered to their home or business. In addition, flexible fulfillment options are available for in-store purchases and those made through the contact center. Regardless of the channels through which customers choose to engage with us, we strive to provide them with a seamless experience across channels and an endless aisle of products, enabled by our flexible fulfillment capabilities. Our ability to sell products in-store, online, on-site, or through our contact centers speaks to our leverage of our existing infrastructure with the omnichannel capabilities we continue to introduce.\n\n## In-Store\n\nOur 1,798 Lowe's-branded home improvement stores, inclusive of 1,737 in the U.S. and 61 in Canada, are generally open seven days per week and average approximately 112,000 square feet of retail selling space, plus approximately 32,000 square feet of outdoor garden center selling space.  The 173 RONA stores operate under various complementary store formats that address target customers and occasions. Our home improvement stores in the U.S. and Canada offer similar products and services, with certain variations based on localization.  We continue to develop and implement tools to make our sales associates more efficient and to integrate our order management and fulfillment processes.  Our home improvement stores have Wi-Fi capabilities that provide customers with Internet access, making information available quickly to further simplify the shopping experience.\n\n## Online\n\nThrough our websites and mobile applications, we seek to empower consumers by providing a 24/7 shopping experience, product information, customer ratings and reviews, buying guides, how-to videos and other information. These tools help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions and give them increased confidence to undertake home improvement projects. We enable customers to choose from a variety of fulfillment options, including buying online and picking up in-store, curbside pick-up, truck delivery and parcel shipment to their homes or businesses. We also offer a new virtual kitchen design service and virtual sales support for sheds, fencing, generators, and other project-related categories to allow our customers to shop how, when, and where they want for services projects.\n\n## On-Site\n\nWe have on-site specialists available for retail and Pro customers to assist them in selecting products and services for their projects.  Our Pro sales managers meet with Pro customers at their place of business or on a job site and leverage nearby stores and our distribution network to ensure we meet customer needs for products and resources.  In addition, our In-Home Sales program is available in a majority of U.S. Lowe's home improvement stores to discuss varying exterior projects such as windows/doors, roofing, siding, and deck projects, whose characteristics lend themselves to an in-home consultative sales approach.",

We believe that any judgment against us involving our products for actual damages will be adequately covered by our recorded accruals and, where applicable, excess liability insurance coverage.\n\nWe are also subject to breach of warranty claims resulting from state and federal consumer protection laws which allow consumers to hold manufacturers legally responsible  for  \"breaches\"  of  implied  or  ex press  warranties.  Claims  can  include  but  are  not  limited  to  a  refund,  a  replacement  vehicle,  a  recovery  of  legal  and administrative fees or other monetary damages. Losses that we believe to be probable and estimable based on evaluation of historical transactions are included in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities and are reviewed regularly for adequacy. We believe that any judgment against us involving our warranties for actual damages will be adequately covered by our recorded accruals.\n\nGuarantees We enter into indemnification agreements for liability claims involving products manufactured primarily by certain joint ventures.  These guarantees terminate in years ranging from 2025 to 2029, or upon the occurrence of specific events or are ongoing. We believe that the related potential costs incurred are adequately covered by our recorded accruals, which are insignificant. The maximum future undiscounted payments mainly based on royalties received associated with vehicles sold to date were $3.7 billion and $3.5 billion for these guarantees at  December 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of which relates to the indemnification agreements.\n\nWe provide payment guarantees on commercial loans outstanding with third parties such as dealers. In some instances, certain assets of the party or our payables to the party whose debt or performance we have guaranteed may offset, to some degree, the amount of any potential future payments. We are also exposed to residual value guarantees associated with certain sales to rental car companies.\n\nWe periodically enter into agreements that incorporate indemnification provisions in the normal course of business. It is not possible to estimate our maximum exposure  under  these  indemnifications  or  guarantees  due  to  the  conditional  nature  of  these  obligations.  Insignificant  amounts  have  been  recorded  for  such obligations  as  the  majority  of  them  are  not  probable  or  estimable  at  this  time  and  the  fair  value  of  the  guarantees  at  issuance  was  insignificant.  Refer  to  the Opel/Vauxhall Sale section of this note for additional information on our indemnification obligations to Stellantis under the Agreement.\n\nCredit  Cards Credit card programs offer rebates that can be applied primarily against the purchase or lease of our vehicles. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, our redemption liability was insignificant, our deferred revenue was $425 million and $384 million, and qualified cardholders had rebates available, net of deferred program revenue, of $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. Our redemption liability and deferred revenue are recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities.\n\nSupplier  Finance  Programs Third-party finance providers offer certain suppliers the option for payment in advance of their invoice due date through financing programs that we established. We retain our obligation to the participating suppliers, and we make payments directly to the third-party finance providers on the original  invoice  due  date  pursuant  to  the  original  invoice  terms.  There  are  no  assets  pledged  as  security  or  other  forms  of  guarantees  provided  for  committed payments. Our outstanding eligible balances under our supplier finance programs were $0.9 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, which are recorded in Accounts payable (principally trade).\n\nThe following table represents the change in the supplier finance program obligation (dollars in billions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of C ontents\n\n## Leases\n\nWe enter into contractual arrangements for the utilization of certain non-owned assets which are ev aluated as finance or operating leases upon commencement, and are accounted for accordingly. Specifically, a contract is or contains a lease when (1) the contract contains an explicitly or implicitly identified asset and (2) we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset and direct how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract in exchange for consideration. We assess whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception of the contract.\n\nOur leases include certain retail locations, warehouse and distribution space, office space, equipment, and v ehicles. A substantial majority of our leases have remaining lease terms of one to 20 years. Our real estate leases typically prov ide the option to extend the lease for fiv e-year terms, and some of our leases include early termination options. The lease term used to calculate the right-of-use asset and lease liability at commencement includes the impacts of options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. When determining whether it is reasonably certain that we will exercise an option at commencement, we consider v arious existing economic factors, including market conditions, real estate strategies, the nature, length, and terms of the agreement, as well as the uncertainty of the condition of leased equipment at the end of the lease term. Based on these determinations, we generally conclude that the exercise of renewal options would not be reasonably certain in determining the lease term at commencement.\n\nThe discount rate used to calculate the present v alue of lease payments is the rate implicit in the lease, when readily determinable. As the rate implicit in the lease is rarely readily determinable, we use a secured incremental borrowing rate, which is updated on a quarterly basis, as the discount rate for the present v alue of lease payments.\n\nReal estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, and operating expenses applicable to the leased asset are generally our obligations under our lease agreements. In instances where these payments are fixed, they are included in the measurement of our lease liabilities, and when v ariable, they are excluded and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Certain of our lease agreements also include rental payments based on an index or rate, and others include rental payments based on a percentage of sales. For v ariable payments dependent upon an index or rate, we apply the activ e index or rate as of the lease commencement date. Variable lease payments not based on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of our lease liabilities, as they cannot be reasonably estimated, and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\n\nLeases that hav e a term of twelv e months or less upon commencement are considered short-term in nature. Short-term leases are not included on the consolidated balance sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis ov er the lease term. We hav e also elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for certain classes of assets including real estate and certain equipment.\n\nOur lease agreements do not contain any material residual v alue guarantees or material restrictiv e cov enants.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their fair v alues at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price ov er the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price ov er the fair v alue of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill, but assess the recov erability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair v alue of each reporting unit supports its carrying v alue. Each fiscal year, we may assess qualitativ e factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair v alue of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitativ e impairment assessments, with a quantitativ e assessment completed periodically or as facts and circumstances warrant. Additional information regarding our goodwill is included in Note 4.",

However, actual resale values are subject to fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements, such as from one or more of the factors discussed above. If the actual resale values of any vehicles resold by our vehicle customers and partners are lower than the residual values we have agreed to with them, the residual value guarantees may be triggered and, as a result, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\n\nFinally, our vehicle and solar energy system financing programs and our energy storage sales programs also expose us to customer credit risk. In the event of a widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event, our customers may be unable or unwilling to satisfy their payment obligations to us on a timely basis or at all. If a significant number of our customers default, we may incur substantial credit losses and/or impairment charges with respect to the underlying assets.\n\n## We must manage ongoing obligations under our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York relating to our Gigafactory New York.\n\nWe are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the State University of New York (the 'SUNY Foundation'). These agreements provide for the construction and use of our Gigafactory New York, which we have primarily used for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components and Supercharger components, and for other lessor-approved functions. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during a period that was initially 10 years beginning April 30, 2018. As of December 31, 2024, we have met and expect to meet the requirements under this arrangement, as may be modified and discussed from time to time, based on our current and anticipated level of operations. While we expect to have and grow significant operations at Gigafactory New York and the surrounding Buffalo area, any failure by us in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet all applicable future obligations may result in our incurring financial liabilities in the form of 'program payments' which would not be expected to have a material adverse effect to our financial operations, the termination of our lease at G igafactory New York, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations. Any of the foregoing events may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## If we are unable to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel, our ability to compete may be harmed.\n\nThe loss of the services of any of our key employees or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operations or delay the development, introduction and ramp of our products and services. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer. None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success also depends upon our ability to attract, hire and retain a large number of engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and delivery, service, installation, technology and support personnel, especially to support our planned high-volume product sales, market and geographical expansion and technological innovations. If we are not successful in managing these risks, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\n\nEmployees may leave Tesla or choose other employers over Tesla due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience, or any negative publicity related to us. In regions where we have or will have operations, particularly significant engineering and manufacturing centers, there is strong competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business, including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles, engineering and electrical and building construction expertise. We also compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and start-ups and emerging companies that promise short-term growth opportunities.\n\nFinally, our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins, with an emphasis on equity-based awards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders. We periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards available under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans. If we are unable to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals for such future increases, we may have to expend additional cash to compensate our employees and our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel may be harmed.",

      "answer": "Home Depot's stock options typically vest at a rate of 25% per year starting on the second anniversary of the grant, with provisions for accelerated vesting upon reaching age 60 with five years of service. McDonald's stock options become exercisable in four equal installments beginning one year after the grant date, with a standard vesting period of four years. Tesla's 2018 CEO Performance Award includes 12 vesting tranches tied to both market capitalization milestones (starting at $100 billion) and operational milestones (based on total revenue or Adjusted EBITDA), with a five-year holding period post-exercise. These differences indicate that HD and MCD use more standardized vesting schedules focused on tenure, while Tesla's approach is highly performance-driven and tied to strategic company goals.",

We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants.

The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at $100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0 billion thereafter (based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been achieved for the four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial statements filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of the exercise price of $70.01 per share, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five years post-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding.\n\nThe achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2021 is provided below. Although an operational milestone is deemed achieved in the last quarter of the relevant annualized period, it may be certified only after the financial statements supporting its achievement have been filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K.\n\n",

GM's Audit Committee oversees cybersecurity as part of a broader financial and enterprise risk management framework, with oversight supported by the Financial Risk Council. TSLA's Audit Committee directly oversees cybersecurity, receiving quarterly updates from senior management, including the Information Security and Legal teams, and engages in ad hoc cybersecurity discussions with leadership.

Cybersecurity\n\nWe have processes in place for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from potential unauthorized occurrences on or through our electronic information systems that could adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information systems or the information residing on those systems. These include a wide variety of mechanisms, controls, technologies, methods, systems, and other processes that are designed to prevent, detect, or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, or other security incidents or vulnerabilities affecting the data. The data include confidential, proprietary, and business and personal information that we collect, process, store, and transmit as part of our business, including on behalf of third parties. We also use systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security incident at a third-party vendor or customer. Additionally, we use processes to oversee and identify material risks from cybersecurity threats associated with our use of third-party technology and systems, including: technology and systems we use for encryption and authentication; employee email; content delivery to customers; back-office support; and other functions.\n\nAs part of our risk management process, we conduct application security assessments, vulnerability management, penetration testing, security audits, and ongoing risk assessments. We also maintain a variety of incident response plans that are utilized when incidents are detected. We require employees with access to information systems, including all corporate employees, to undertake data protection and cybersecurity training and compliance programs annually.\n\nWe have a unified and centrally-coordinated team, led by our chief security officer, that is responsible for implementing and maintaining centralized cybersecurity and data protection practices at Amazon in close coordination with senior leadership and other teams across Amazon. Reporting to our chief security officer are a number of ex perienced chief information security officers responsible for various parts of our business, including AWS, each of whom is supported by a team of trained cybersecurity professionals. In addition to our extensive in-house cybersecurity capabilities, at times we also engage assessors, consultants, auditors, or other third parties to assist with assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity risks.\n\nOur cybersecurity risks and associated mitigations are evaluated by senior leadership, including as part of our enterprise risk assessments that are reviewed by the Audit Committee and our Board of Directors. Such risks and mitigations are also subject to oversight by the Security Committee of our Board of Directors. Additional information about cybersecurity risks we face is discussed in Item 1A of Part I, 'Risk Factors,' under the heading 'We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Incidents,' which should be read in conjunction with the information above.\n\nThe Security Committee, which is comprised of independent directors, oversees our policies and procedures for protecting our cybersecurity infrastructure and for compliance with applicable data protection and security regulations, and related risks. The Security Committee receives reports regarding such risks from management, including our chief security officer, and reports to the Board at least annually. The Security Committee also oversees the Board's response to any significant cybersecurity incidents.\n\nOur chief security officer, who has extensive cybersecurity knowledge and skills gained from over 15 years of work experience on the security team at Amazon and an extensive career in the technology and cybersecurity industries as a senior executive in the federal government, heads the team responsible for implementing and maintaining cybersecurity and data protection practices at Amazon and reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer.",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThe overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer with support from the Financial Risk Council, which reviews and, where appropriate, approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks. The Financial Risk Council comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the Audit Committee and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee and Finance Committee assist and guide the Board of Directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies. A risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies, risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the Financial Risk Council. Our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from large adverse market movements on our key exposures.\n\nAutomotive The following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and commodity risk. Sensitivity  analysis  is  used  to  measure  the  potential  loss  in  the  fair  value  of  financial  instruments  with  ex posure  to  market  risk.  The  models  used  assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in ex change rates, interest rate yield curves and commodity prices. For options and other instruments with nonlinear returns, models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of market shifts. There are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot ex change rates and commodity prices change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency exposures and offsetting long-short positions in currency or other exposures, such as interest rates and commodity prices, which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We have foreign currency exposures related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations. At December 31, 2024, our most significant foreign currency exposures were between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan,  Korean won,  Mexican peso and  Brazilian real.  Derivative  instruments  such  as  foreign  currency  forwards,  swaps  and  options  are  primarily  used  to  hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues, costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 12 months at December 31, 2024.\n\nThe net fair value liability of financial instruments with ex posure to foreign currency risk was $0.2 billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. These amounts are calculated utilizing a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and other assets. The potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been $0.3 billion and insignificant at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into U.S. dollars as part of the consolidation  process.  Fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  ex change  rates  can  therefore  create  volatility  in  the  results  of  operations  and  may  adversely  affect  our financial condition.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\n\n## Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, ex tortion, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws.\n\nIdentifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity risks related to our business, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach including third party assessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews. To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we, among other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration testing using external third-party tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability reporting, conduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including our consumer products) and implement appropriate changes.\n\nWe have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected stages: 1) preparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and recovery, and 4) post-incident analysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity.\n\nSecurity events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents are evaluated to determine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact.\n\nWe also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals then collaborate with technical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form detection, mitigation and remediation strategies.\n\nAs part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and compliance with applicable practices and standards. As of 2024, our Information Security Management System has been certified to conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.\n\nOur risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third parties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service providers. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated when determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers and potential fourth-party risks when handling and/or processing our employee, business or customer data. In addition to new vendor onboarding, we perform risk management during third-party cybersecurity compromise incidents to identify and mitigate risks to us from third-party incidents.\n\nWe describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the heading 'Our information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences' included as part of our risk factor disclosures at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Cybersecurity Governance\n\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. Our Audit Committee is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. Members of the Audit Committee receive updates on a quarterly basis from senior management, including leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity. This includes existing and new cybersecurity risks, status on how management is addressing and/or mitigating those risks, cybersecurity and data privacy incidents (if any) and status on key information security initiatives. Our Board members also engage in ad hoc conversations with management on cybersecurity-related news events and discuss any updates to our cybersecurity risk management and strategy programs.",

There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place. V iolation of any ex isting or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely.\n\nIn addition, because China-based sellers account for significant portions of our third-party seller services and advertising revenues, and China-based suppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods, regulatory and trade restrictions, data protection and cybersecurity laws, economic factors, geopolitical events, security issues, or other factors negatively impacting China-based sellers and suppliers could adversely affect our operating results.\n\n## The Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations\n\nDemand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, promotions, product launches, or unforeseeable events, such as in response to global economic conditions such as recessionary fears or rising inflation, natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or ex treme weather (including as a result of climate change), or geopolitical events. For ex ample, we ex pect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, splitshipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand.\n\nAs a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities) because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores and the related receivables settle quickly. Typically, there is also a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 due to inventory purchases and third-party seller sales. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year as vendors and sellers are paid, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.\n\n## We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers\n\nThe law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers' descriptions, and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers. Under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may reimburse customers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results.\n\n## We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be",

The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at $100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0 billion thereafter (based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been achieved for the four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial statements filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of the exercise price of $70.01 per share, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five years post-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding.\n\nThe achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2021 is provided below. Although an operational milestone is deemed achieved in the last quarter of the relevant annualized period, it may be certified only after the financial statements supporting its achievement have been filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K.\n\n",

      "answer": "Home Depot (HD) competes with warehouse clubs based on customer experience, price, product availability, and delivery options, emphasizing its interconnected shopping experience across digital and physical channels. Lowe's (LOW) highlights warehouse clubs as part of a broad competitive landscape and focuses on omnichannel capabilities, including flexible fulfillment and in-store experience enhancements across its 1,746 stores. Starbucks (SBUX) competes with warehouse clubs in the grocery and retail channels for coffee and tea product sales, relying on brand strength and specialty positioning rather than volume-based retail strategies. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies view warehouse clubs as competitors, their strategic responses are tailored to their core business models\u2014HD and LOW focus on integrated retail experiences, while SBUX emphasizes brand and product differentiation in wholesale channels.",

      "answer": "AMZN highlights that it holds foreign currency assets such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and Japanese Yen, and notes that exchange rate fluctuations can materially affect the value of these assets when translated into U.S. Dollars. MCD discloses that it maintains a diversified basket of foreign currency net assets, with specific emphasis on the largest exposures at year-end, though exact figures are not provided. TSLA notes that foreign exchange gains and losses significantly impact its financial results due to the remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated balances, and it does not typically hedge this exposure. Together, these perspectives indicate that while all three companies face foreign exchange risk, their approaches to managing and disclosing this risk differ, with AMZN focusing on asset diversification, MCD on net exposure management, and TSLA on the financial impact of unhedged positions.",

Actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the ex penditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.\n\nWe have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the ex penditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, our and our customers' development and use of artificial intelligence may result in increased claims of infringement or other claims, including those based on unauthorized use of third-party technology or content.\n\nOur digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.\n\n## We Have Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nThe results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign ex change rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from ex pectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and Japanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.\n\n## Operating Risks\n\n## Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\n\nWe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n\n## We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\n\nWe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.\n\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by, among other things, general economic, business, and geopolitical conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.\n\nOur sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following:\n\n- our ability to retain and increase sales to ex isting customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers' demands;\n- our ability to retain and ex pand our network of sellers;\n- our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;\n- the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;",

      "question": "How do Lowe's (LOW), Nike (NKE), and Starbucks (SBUX) each utilize interest rate swap agreements, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to managing interest rate risk in 2023?",
      "answer": "Lowe's (LOW) uses interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on certain debt, but notes that fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on its financial condition due to its largely fixed-rate long-term debt. Nike (NKE) has $1.8 billion in notional amount of interest rate swaps as of May 31, 2024, where it receives fixed interest at the same rate as its term debt and pays variable interest based on SOFR plus a fixed spread, with these swaps maturing in fiscal 2034. Starbucks (SBUX) uses interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks primarily to hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. These differences show that while all three companies use interest rate swaps, Lowe\u2019s sees minimal exposure due to fixed-rate debt, Nike actively hedges long-dated liabilities, and Starbucks proactively manages anticipated financing risks.",

      "question": "How do AMZN, NKE, and TSLA each approach the protection and strategic use of copyrights, and what does this reveal about their differing priorities in leveraging intellectual property for competitive advantage?",
      "answer": "AMZN emphasizes the registration and legal protection of copyrights as part of its broader intellectual property strategy, highlighting the importance of securing proprietary rights to maintain its competitive edge in a rapidly evolving and intensely competitive marketplace. NKE owns registered copyrights for its designs, graphics, software applications, and digital goods, and it actively pursues protection and enforcement of these rights globally to support its brand identity and product differentiation. TSLA seeks to protect its innovative designs and technologies through copyrights, among other intellectual property rights, but also emphasizes a more open approach by pledging not to sue in good faith for patent infringement in the electric vehicle space, aiming to accelerate industry-wide innovation. Together, these approaches reveal that AMZN focuses on comprehensive IP protection across a diverse set of offerings, NKE emphasizes brand and design protection to maintain leadership in athletic apparel, and TSLA balances IP protection with open innovation to drive broader adoption of electric vehicles.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMZN \u2192 Copyrights: Amazon explicitly states that it has registered or applied for registration of a number of U.S. and international copyrights, underscoring their importance in protecting proprietary rights in a highly competitive environment.",
        "Hop 2: NKE \u2192 Copyrights: Nike owns registered copyrights in designs, graphics, software applications, and digital goods, and views these rights as critical to supporting its brand, success, and competitive position globally.",
        "Hop 3: TSLA \u2192 Copyrights: Tesla seeks to protect its innovations through copyrights and other IP rights but also promotes open innovation by pledging not to sue in good faith for patent infringement related to electric vehicles, balancing protection with broader industry growth."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Competition\n\nOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, virtual assistants, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure, tools and services relating to artificial intelligence, and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, communications, and other electronic devices and services; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats; and (10) providers of virtual or inperson healthcare services. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers' ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth's most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 1,556,000 fulltime and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for personnel across other parts of our business.\n\nWe strive to be Earth's best employer. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement this objective and invent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (education funding for eligible employees). Over 240,000 Amazon employees around the world have participated in Career Choice. We also continue to inspect and refine the mechanisms we use to hire, develop, evaluate, and retain our employees. In addition, safety is integral to everything we do at Amazon and we continue to invest in safety improvements such as capital improvements, new safety technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineering ergonomic solutions. Our safety team is dedicated to using the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.",

These factors and others have also made, and may continue to make, it more difficult to maintain an effective system of operational internal controls for a dispersed workforce, and to train partners to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience. Additionally, there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers, who are necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. If we are unable to recruit, retain, and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in the availability and cost of labor could adversely affect our business.\n\nOur business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs, both domestically and internationally. Such increases could be triggered by state and federal legislation and regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling, and benefits; increases in healthcare and workers' compensation insurance costs; and increases in wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high-quality employees with the right skill sets. For ex ample, at the federal level, effective July 1, 2024, the United States Department of Labor increased the minimum salary threshold requirements for employees who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act overtime requirements, and at the state level, Assembly Bill 1228 increased minimum wage and established working hour and working condition standards for certain partners in California. These changes, along with others that may occur in the future, could have a significant impact on the classification of employees as being exempt from overtime and add to our labor costs. The growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of employees, to maintain an effective system of operational internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise, and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience; the failure to do so could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, a shortage of labor for store positions, and the increased availability of alternative telecommuting employment options by other employers could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for other key functions. In addition, our wages and benefits programs may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent.\n\nStarting in September 2021, Starbucks partners at a number of company-operated stores sought union representation through elections conducted by the National Labor Relations Board. Unions have secured representation rights at hundreds of our more than 10,000 U.S. company-operated stores, with potentially more to follow, and Starbucks is engaged in collective bargaining for initial collective bargaining agreements for these stores. If we encounter difficulties negotiating collective bargaining agreements, are unsuccessful in those efforts, or obtain contracts with unfavorable terms, then we could incur additional costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility, and increase our operational complexity. These risks could also present the potential to disrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully implement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business needs.\n\nThe law places limitations on unilateral actions taken with respect to employees who are represented by unions because, in certain circumstances, the law requires the employer to notify and to bargain with the union prior to making certain operational or other changes that may affect employee wages, hours, or other terms and conditions of employment. Moreover, where a petition for representation has been filed by a union, the employer is also constrained from making changes in wages, hours, and working conditions. These limitations could also negatively affect our costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility, and increase our operational complexity. They also present the potential to disrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully implement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business needs.\n\nMoreover, we have experienced job actions in some company-operated stores. Such job actions and work stoppages have the potential to negatively impact our operations, third-party providers upon whom we rely to deliver product, our sales and customer flow in impacted locations, our costs, and can also have a negative impact on our reputation and brand.\n\nAdditionally, our position with respect to unions and the unionization of partners could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and could have material adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results. These positions could also expose us to legal risk, causing us to incur costs to defend legal and regulatory actions, potential penalties and restrictions, and reputational harm.\n\n## Risks Related to Competition\n\n## We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.\n\nThe specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience (such as delivery service and mobile ordering), and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all of these areas in each of our channels and markets. Accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. In the U.S., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to Starbucks stores and/or average value per transaction, adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. Similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors, or \u00ae",

In addition, decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Operations\n\n## We may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our Gigafactories, which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products.\n\nOur plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. We also produce several vehicle components at our Gigafactories, such as battery modules and packs and drive units, and manufacture energy storage products. If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, which may harm our business and operating results.\n\nFinally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured by us and by our suppliers are stored and recycled at our various facilities. Any mishandling of these products may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.\n\n## We face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions.\n\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable. Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., with additional manufacturing operations in China and Europe, create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements; enforceability of our contractual rights; trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or ex change controls; and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products. For example, we monitor tax legislation changes on a global basis, including changes arising as a result of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting. Such conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention, and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them effectively.\n\n## Our business may suffer if our products or features contain defects, fail to perform as expected or take longer than expected to become fully functional.\n\nIf our products contain design or manufacturing defects, whether relating to our software or hardware, that cause them not to perform as designed or intended or that require repair, or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD (Supervised) features take longer than expected to become enabled, are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services may be harmed, and we may experience delivery delays, product recalls, allegations of product liability, breach of warranty and related consumer protection claims and significant warranty and other expenses. While we are continuously working to develop and improve our products' capability and performance, there is no guarantee that any incremental changes in the specific software or equipment we deploy in our vehicles over time will not result in initial functional disparities from prior iterations or will perform as forecast in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers. We have performed, and continue to perform, extensive internal testing on our products and features, though, like the rest of the industry, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate certain aspects of their long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics, including exposure to or consequence of external attacks. While we attempt to identify and address or remedy defects we identify pre-production and sale, there may be latent defects that we may be unable to detect or control for in our products, and thereby address, prior to their sale to or installation for customers.",

The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.\n\n## 2018 CEO Performance Award\n\nIn March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors' grant of 101.3 million stock option awards, as adjusted to give effect to the five-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2020 ('Stock Split'), to our CEO (the '2018 CEO Performance Award'). The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at $100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0 billion thereafter (based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been achieved for the four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial statements filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of the exercise price of $70.01 per share, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five years post-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding.\n\nThe achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2021 is provided below. Although an operational milestone is deemed achieved in the last quarter of the relevant annualized period, it may be certified only after the financial statements supporting its achievement have been filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K.\n\n",

      "question": "How do Amazon, Lowe's, and McDonald's each characterize the impact of negative media coverage on their brand reputation and regulatory scrutiny, and what does this reveal about their exposure to public perception risks in the consumer discretionary sector?",
      "answer": "Amazon highlights that media, political, and regulatory scrutiny amplifies legal and reputational risks, particularly around competition and privacy practices, with potential material effects on operations. Lowe's notes that adverse legal proceedings or regulatory enforcement could lead to reputational harm and class action litigation, though none are currently considered material. McDonald's emphasizes that negative media or public commentary\u2014especially around food sourcing, labor practices, or environmental issues\u2014can rapidly damage brand value and financial performance. Together, these perspectives show that while all three face reputational risks from negative media, Amazon and McDonald's are more explicitly tied to brand perception and regulatory exposure, whereas Lowe's frames the risk more in terms of legal proceedings with less immediate brand impact.",

It is not clear how ex isting laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, and consumer protection apply to aspects of our operations such as the internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, satellite communications services, and healthcare. A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the ex tent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and ex panding as the scope of our businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews, investigations, and other proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations. For example, we face a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects of our operations infringe competition or consumer protection rules, including aspects of Amazon's operation of its stores, including its fulfillment network and Prime, and certain aspects of AWS's offering of cloud services. We strongly dispute these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these investigations. Similarly, we face investigations under a growing patchwork of laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and disclosure of data, the interpretation of which continues to evolve, leading to uncertainty about how regulators will view our privacy practices. In addition, regulators and lawmakers are increasingly focused on controlling additional aspects of the operations of technology companies and companies they have characterized to be online 'gatekeepers' through the application of existing regulations and laws and the adoption of new regulations and laws, which increases our compliance costs and limits the operation of our business. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations. The media, political, and regulatory scrutiny we face, which may continue to increase, amplifies these risks.\n\n## Claims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations\n\nAs an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range of issues, including patent and other intellectual property matters, tax es, labor and employment (including the characterization of delivery drivers), competition and antitrust, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties (including artificial intelligence technologies and services), healthcare, and other matters. The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach, as our products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more people, and as governments and regulatory authorities seek to regulate us on a pre-emptive basis. For example, we are litigating a number of matters alleging price fix ing, monopolization, and consumer protection claims, including those brought by state attorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations.\n\n## We Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture\n\nSome of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and can require product recalls or other actions. Third parties who sell products using our services and stores also expose us to product liability claims. Additionally, under our A-to-z Guarantee,",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations. Our business is subject to a wide array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations. In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state, and local agencies. These laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic, or social events. Changes in, ex panded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage requirements, collective bargaining, the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees, the distinction between employees and contractors, other wage, labor or workplace regulations, health care, data privacy and cybersecurity, the sale and pricing of some of our products, transportation, logistics, international trade, responsible sourcing, supply chain transparency, taxes, unclaimed property, sustainability, the environment and climate change, including energy costs and consumption, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations. In addition, if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery laws, we could be subject to reputational and legal risks, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nFuture litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements, negatively affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe are, and in the future will become, involved in lawsuits, including consumer, commercial, employment, tort and other litigation, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. Some of these proceedings raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities. The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes of, or resolutions to, these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments. Furthermore, defending against these proceedings may require a diversion of management's attention and resources. None of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved, individually or collectively, are considered material.\n\nThe inflation or deflation of commodity and other prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, and our sales.\n\nPrices of certain commodity products, including lumber, copper, energy, and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, inflationary pressures, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, tariffs and trade restrictions, and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity and other prices, such as changes in lumber prices, and our ability to pass them on to our customers or manage them through our portfolio strategy, have affected, and may continue to affect, the demand for our products and our sales.\n\nTax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions.\n\nWe may be affected by higher rates of federal, state, or local tax  imposed as a result of political developments or economic conditions, which could affect our effective tax rate. Our effective tax  rate and future tax  liability could be adversely affected by regulatory and legal changes, the results of tax  audits and ex aminations, disallowed tax strategies, and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax  matters, all of which could negatively impact our business. Changes in tax  laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally could also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nLiquidity and access to capital rely on efficient, rational, and open capital markets and are dependent on our credit strength. Our inability to access capital markets could negatively affect our business, financial performance, and results of operations.\n\nWe rely on cash flows from operations, as well as continued access to capital markets on both a short-term and long-term basis, as needed, to fund our operations, make strategic investments to support long-term growth, return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and repay debt maturities as they become due. Our access to capital markets depends on our strong credit ratings, the overall condition of such capital markets and our operating performance. If rating agencies lower or place our credit ratings on a credit watch, or if we ex perience a deterioration of certain financial ratios, it could adversely affect our ability to access the public debt markets and our cost of funds. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically, and there is no guarantee that our current credit ratings will remain the same. Disruption in the financial markets, including as a result of rising interest rates, bank failures or other macroeconomic conditions, or an erosion of our credit strength or declines on our credit rating could impact negatively our ability to meet capital requirements or fund working capital needs.\n\n## Item 1B - Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.",

Generally speaking, any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by the use of forward-looking or conditional words, such as 'could,' 'should,' 'can,' 'continue,' 'aim,' 'estimate,' 'forecast,' 'intend,' 'look,' 'may,' 'will,' 'ex pect,' 'believ e,' 'anticipate,' 'plan,' 'remain,' 'confident,' 'commit,' 'enable,' 'potential' and \"trajectory \" or similar ex pressions. In particular, statements regarding our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry are forward-looking statements. They reflect our expectations, are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the dates the statements are made. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update such forward-looking statements. Y ou should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.\n\n## Risk F actors\n\nOur business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are described below and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. A dditional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly adversely affect our business. If any of these risks were to materialize or intensify, our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change and our performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## STRATEGY AND BRAND\n\n## If we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, we may not be able to drive business growth.\n\nTo drive Systemwide sales, operating income and free cash flow growth, our business strategies - including the components of our Accelerating the Arches growth strategy - must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal and capturing additional market share. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our System's continued ability to:\n\n- capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages, including by maximizing our marketing, committing to our core menu items, and doubling down on digital, delivery, drive thru and restaurant development;\n- innovate and differentiate the M cDonald's experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;\n- build upon our investments to transform and enhance the customer experience, including building one of the world's largest consumer platforms to fuel engagement;\n- run great restaurants by building the easiest and most efficient restaurant operating platform which enables franchisees to run restaurants more efficiently  and utiliz e the latest cloud-based technology  to make it easier for crews to deliv er ex ceptional customer service;\n- accelerate our existing strategies, including through growth opportunities and building a modern company platform that unlocks speed and innovation throughout the organization; and\n- evolve and adjust our strategies in response to, among other things, changing consumer behavior, and other events impacting our results of operations and liquidity.\n\nIf we are delayed or unsuccessful in evolving or executing against our strategies, if the execution of our strategies proves to be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## Failure to preserve the value or relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nTo continue to be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value and relevance of our brand, including our corporate purpose, mission and values. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions, which are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, the manner in which we source commodities and general business practices across the System, including the people practices at M cDonald's restaurants. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health, environmental and other scientific studies and conclusions, which continuously evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the 'informal eating out' ('IEO') segment or perceptions of our brand, generally or relative to available alternatives. Our business could also be impacted by business incidents or practices, whether actual or perceived, particularly if they receive considerable publicity or result in litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings, as well as by our perceived position or lack of position on environmental, social responsibility, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters. In addition, we cannot ensure that franchisees or business partners will not take actions that adversely affect the value and relevance of our brand. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the IEO segment or our brand, culture, operations, suppliers or franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary or perceptions, whether or not accurate, our brand and financial results may suffer.\n\nIf we do not anticipate and address industry trends and evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and marketing plans, our business could suffer.\n\nOur continued success depends on our System's ability to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages. In order to do so, we need to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and industry trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings, and consumer behavior and preferences, including with respect to the use of digital channels and environmental and social responsibility matters. If we are not able to predict, or quickly and effectively respond to, these changes, or if our competitors are\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 28",

      "question": "How do Home Depot, Lowe's, and Starbucks each utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage their exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and what do their respective strategies reveal about their financial risk management approaches?",
      "answer": "Home Depot uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its fixed/floating-rate debt portfolio, with $6.0 billion of floating-rate debt principal as of February 2, 2025, representing 12% of its senior notes portfolio. These swaps were in an aggregate liability position of $795 million, and a one percentage point increase in interest rates would raise its annual interest expense by $60 million. Lowe's utilizes fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges, applying the shortcut method of accounting, and settled forward interest rate swaps totaling $4.8 billion in notional value in recent debt issuances, receiving $426 million in total payments. Starbucks enters into both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges via interest rate swaps to manage variability in interest payments and hedge exposure on fixed-rate debt, with gains and losses recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) and later reclassified to interest expense. Together, these strategies show that while all three companies use interest rate swaps, they differ in structure and accounting treatment\u2014Home Depot focuses on balancing debt mix, Lowe's emphasizes hedge accounting efficiency, and Starbucks prioritizes cash flow predictability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of C ontents\n\nThe excess of the purchase price ov er fair v alues of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill due to the use of preliminary information in our initial estimates. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n\n## MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES\n\nWe value the majority of our inv entory under the retail inv entory method, with the remainder of our inv entories v alued under a cost method, primarily the first-in, first-out method. Under the retail inv entory method, inv entories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail v alue of inv entories.\n\nThe retail v alue of our inv entory is adjusted as needed to reflect current market conditions. Because these adjustments are based on current prev ailing market conditions, the v alue of our inv entory approximates the lower of cost or market. The v aluation under the retail inv entory method is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inv entory losses (or shrink). As such, there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inv entory cost and gross profit. We determine markups and markdowns based on the consideration of a v ariety of factors such as current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and buying trends, age of the merchandise, and weather conditions.\n\nWe calculate shrink based on actual inv entory losses identified as a result of physical inv entory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inv entory losses occurring between physical inv entory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inv entory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. A 10% increase in the shrink rate used to estimate our inv entory shrink reserv e would hav e increased cost of sales by approximately $95 million for fiscal 2024. Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inv entory losses has not been material to our annual financial results.\n\nWe do not believ e there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to v alue our inv entory under the retail inv entory method. We believ e that the retail inv entory method prov ides an inv entory v aluation which approximates cost and results in v aluing our inv entory at the lower of cost or market.\n\n## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nFor information on our accounting policies and on accounting pronouncements that hav e impacted or may materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Item 7A . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures A bout Market Risk.\n\n## INTEREST RATE RISK\n\nWe have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our long-term debt portfolio. We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed/floating-rate debt portfolio, none of which are for trading or speculativ e purposes. At February 2, 2025, after giv ing consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, floating-rate debt principal was $6.0 billion, or approximately 12% of our senior notes portfolio. Our interest rate swap agreements were in an aggregate liability position of $795 million at February 2, 2025. The changes in the fair v alues of our interest rate swap agreements offset the changes in the fair v alue of the hedged long-term debt. Based on our February 2, 2025 floating-rate debt principal, a one percentage point increase in the interest rate of floating-rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $60 million.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK\n\nWe are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. We use deriv ativ e instruments to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk, none of which are for trading or speculativ e purposes. Our foreign currency related hedging arrangements outstanding at the end of fiscal 2024 were not material.",

The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2024. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued guidance expanding segment disclosure requirements. The amendments require enhanced disclosure for certain segment items and disclosure on how management uses reported measures to assess segment performance. The amendments do not change how segments are determined, aggregated, or how thresholds are applied to determine reportable segments. We expect to adopt the guidance for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2025. We are currently evaluating the expanded disclosure requirements and do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance expanding disclosure requirements related to income taxes. The amendments require enhanced jurisdictional disclosures for the income tax rate reconciliation and related to cash income tax es paid. Additionally, certain disclosures related to unrecognized tax  benefits and indefinite reinvestment assertions were removed. The amendments are effective for our fiscal year ending September 27, 2026. While we are still evaluating the specific impacts and timing of adoption, we anticipate this guidance will have a significant impact on our annual income tax disclosures.\n\nIn March 2024, the SEC issued its final climate disclosure rules, which require the disclosure of climate-related information in annual reports and registration statements. The rules require disclosure in the audited financial statements of certain effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions above certain financial thresholds, as well as amounts related to carbon offsets and renewable energy credits or certificates, if material. Under the rules as originally issued, disclosure requirements begin phasing in for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. However, on April 4, 2024, the SEC determined to voluntarily stay the final rules pending certain legal challenges. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new rules and continue to monitor the status of the related legal challenges.\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance expanding disclosure requirements related to certain income statement expenses. The amendments require tabular disclosure of certain operating expenses disaggregated into categories, such as purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization. The amendments are effective for our fiscal year ending October 1, 2028, and may be applied retrospectively. While we are still evaluating the specific impacts and adoption method, we anticipate this guidance will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## Note 2:    Acquisitions, Div estitures, and Strategic Alliance\n\n## Fiscal 2023\n\nOn January 13, 2023, we sold the assets, primarily consisting of intellectual properties associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand, to Nestl\u00e9 for $110.0 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax  gain of $91.3 million, which was included in gain from sale of assets on our consolidated statement of earnings for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023. Results from Seattle's Best Coffee operations prior to the sale are reported in our Channel Development operating segment.\n\n## Fiscal 2022\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our Evolution Fresh brand and business to Bolthouse Farms. This transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 3:    Deriv ativ e Financial Instruments\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. We enter into interest rate swap agreements, including forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks, settled in cash based upon the difference between an agreed-upon benchmark rate and the prevailing benchmark rate at settlement. These agreements are generally settled around the time of the pricing of the related debt. Each derivative agreement's gain or loss is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt.\n\nTo hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges.

These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2024, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $365 million.\n\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax  assets.\n\nOur effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax  benefits, the applicability of special tax  regimes, changes in foreign ex change rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax  assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax , including changes to the global tax  framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.\n\nWe are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax  provisions and accruals.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

At M ay 31, 2024 and 2023, Short-term  investm ents consisted of available-for-sale debt securities, which are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Accum ulated other com prehensive incom e (loss), unless unrealized losses are determ ined to be unrecoverable. R ealized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determ ined by specific identification. T he C om pany considers all available-for-sale debt securities, including those with m aturity dates beyond 12 m onths, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and, therefore, classifies all securities with m aturity dates beyond three m onths at the date of purchase as current assets within Short-term  investm ents on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nRefer to N ote 4 - Fair Value M easurem ents for m ore inform ation on the C om pany's Short-term  investm ents.\n\n## ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\n\nAccounts receivable, net consist prim arily of am ounts due from  custom ers.

In addition to judgm ents about the creditworthiness of significant custom ers based on ongoing credit evaluations, the C om pany considers historical levels of credit losses, as well as m acroeconom ic and industry trends to determ ine the am ount of the allowance. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $35 m illion as of M ay 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## INVENTORY VALUATION\n\nI nventories, substantially all of which are finished goods, are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value and valued on either an average or a specific identification cost basis. In some instances, the C om pany ships products directly from  its suppliers to the custom er, with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis. I nventory costs prim arily consist of product cost from  the C om pany's suppliers, as well as inbound freight, im port duties, taxes, insurance, logistics and other handling fees.\n\n## PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION\n\nProperty, plant and equipm ent are recorded at cost. D epreciation is determ ined on a straight-line basis for land im provem ents, buildings and leasehold im provem ents over 2 to 40 years and for m achinery and equipm ent over 2 to 15 years.\n\nDepreciation and am ortization of assets used in m anufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in C ost of sales.

Our cash and investments balances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions or invested in highly rated, investment-grade securities. These deposits are typically in ex cess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no entity represented 10% or more of our total receivables balance.\n\n## Supply Risk\n\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for ex cess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is writtendown, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n\n## Operating Lease Vehicles\n\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated depreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $7.03 billion and $7.36 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $1.45 billion and $1.38 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## Digital Assets, Net\n\nWe account for all digital assets held as crypto assets, a subset of indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350-60, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets . We have ownership of and control over our digital assets and we may use third-party custodial services to secure it. The digital assets are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Periods prior to January 1, 2024 include digital assets at cost, net of impairment losses incurred since their acquisition.\n\nWe determine and record the fair value of our digital assets in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ('ASC 820'), based on quoted prices on the active exchange(s) that we have determined is the principal market for such assets (Level I inputs). We determine the cost basis of our digital assets using the specific identification of each unit received.

If our product and serv ice offerings, including those of our suppliers, do not meet applicable product standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety, quality, security, or responsible business practices, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks, as well as governmental enforcement actions.

We have a responsible sourcing audit process, but we are also dependent on our suppliers to ensure that the products and serv ices we prov ide to our customers comply with our standards and applicable law, including with respect to information prov ided by suppliers to gov ernment agencies about the source of the products or the constituent elements of those products. Further, the supply chain for some of the products we sell may be too attenuated for us to know with certainty the source of their components, such as timber, minerals, or other raw materials. Actual, potential or perceiv ed supplier non-compliance with our standards or applicable law - including allegations of non-compliance raised by non-gov ernmental organizations or in third-party reports - could, and in certain instances in the past has, exposed us to litigation or gov ernmental enforcement actions and resulted in costly product recalls; resulted in inability to sell certain products due to failure to meet our standards or due to customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and exclusions; impacted our reputation; and resulted in termination of supplier relationships and/or other liabilities.\n\n## Our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks, including regulatory, product liability, intellectual property, supplier relations, and reputational risks.\n\nIn addition to other product-related risks discussed in this section, as we expand our proprietary product offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. The risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure, and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. To effectiv ely execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully nav igate and av oid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adv ersely affect sales of our suppliers' products, which in turn could adv ersely affect our relationships with certain of our suppliers. Any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and hav e an adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.",

We source, stock, and sell products from domestic and international vendors, and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success. Catastrophic events, extreme weather conditions, public health crises, and global economic and political conditions may adversely affect our global supply chain. For example, impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic placed strains on the domestic and international supply chain, which negatively affected the flow and availability of our products in the past, due to difficulties in timely obtaining products from the manufacturers and suppliers of our products.\n\nWe source, both directly and indirectly, a portion of the products we sell from foreign manufacturers, with China and Mexico being the dominant import sources. Tax and trade policies, tariffs, and other regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries, such as China and Mexico, increase the cost of our merchandise sourced from outside of the United States, which represents a large percentage of our private branded and national brand merchandise. It remains unclear how tax or trade policies, tariffs, customs actions, or trade relations may evolve in the future, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, effective income tax rate, liquidity, and net income. In addition, other countries have responded by changing their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy and regulations already enacted or that may be enacted in the future. Complications in the free movement of goods in North America, an escalation of tariff activity elsewhere in the world or changes to existing free trade agreements, like the United StatesMexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), could adversely impact our financial results. Increased import tariffs and other changes in trade policy could also negatively impact consumer demand for the products we sell. In addition to the potential direct impacts of increased tariff activity, longer term macroeconomic consequences could result, including slower growth, inflation, and higher interest rates. The degree of our ex posure is dependent on, among other things, the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of tariffs. The impact to our business, including net sales and gross margin, will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nFinancial instability among key vendors, political instability, geopolitical or armed conflicts, and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain, changes in the total costs in our supply chain (including fuel), labor costs or labor shortages among our vendors, port labor disputes and security, the outbreak of pandemics, weather-related events, natural disasters, work stoppages, shipping capacity restraints, shipping delays and disruptions, changes in trade policy, retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the United States or a major source country, tariffs or duties, customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and ex clusions, fluctuations in transport availability, capacity, and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs. In recent years, U.S. ports have been impacted by capacity constraints, port congestion and delays, periodic labor disputes, security issues, weather-related events, and natural disasters.\n\nAdditionally, as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements, our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex  and operating it becomes more challenging. If our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, we experience delays in inventory, increased delivery costs, or merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence, and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nThe execution of initiatives to transform our supply chain network could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these investments might not provide the anticipated benefits.\n\nWe continue to transform and expand our supply chain network and existing omnichannel capabilities to meet changing customer needs. These investments are designed to promote greater network capacity and better flow management and optimization while leveraging a market delivery model. Failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. If we are unable to effectively manage the volume, timing, nature, location, and cost of these investments, projects, and changes, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. The cost and potential problems, defects of design, and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with implementing new technologies, restructuring support systems and processes, securing appropriate facility locations, addressing impacts on inventory levels, and managing thirdparty service providers, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and impact our profitability. Our investments to enhance and expand our supply chain might not provide the anticipated benefits, or might take longer than expected to complete or realize anticipated benefits, or might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## We may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims.\n\nThe automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims, and as such we face the risk of such claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other automakers, our vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and such accidents where Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or FSD (Supervised) features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention, especially in light of NHTSA's Standing General Order requiring reports regarding certain crashes involving vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to face, claims and regulatory scrutiny arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures or alleged misrepresentations of such new technologies that we are pioneering. In addition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While we have designed our battery packs to passively contain any single cell's release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash. Likewise, as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity, they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property. Any product liability claim may subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages, product recalls or redesign efforts, and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it, all of which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time-consuming. In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle ex posure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance.\n\n## We will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects in order to succeed.\n\nIn order to maintain and grow our business, we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, investors, ratings agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing, delivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services; our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control. In particular, Tesla's products, business, results of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are subject to significant amounts of commentary by a range of third parties. Such attention can include criticism, which may be exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team. Any such negative perceptions, whether caused by us or not, may harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.\n\n## We may be unable to effectively grow, or manage the compliance, residual value, financing and credit risks related to, our various financing programs.\n\nWe offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily ourselves and through various financial institutions. We also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain markets. Depending on the country, such arrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly with us under which we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease, followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease. We have also offered various arrangements for customers of our solar energy systems whereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or purchase electricity generated by them. If we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing these transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties.\n\nThe profitability of any directly-leased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles' residual values at the outset of the leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles, economic cycles, legislative changes and the pricing of new vehicles. We have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business, which may impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our vehicle leasing program. The funding and growth of this program also rely on our ability to secure adequate financing and/or business partners. If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds, partners or other financing sources, and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers who may expect or need such options, we may be unable to grow our vehicle deliveries. Furthermore, if our vehicle leasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the resulting greater levels of residual risk.",

The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2024. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued guidance expanding segment disclosure requirements. The amendments require enhanced disclosure for certain segment items and disclosure on how management uses reported measures to assess segment performance. The amendments do not change how segments are determined, aggregated, or how thresholds are applied to determine reportable segments. We expect to adopt the guidance for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2025. We are currently evaluating the expanded disclosure requirements and do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance expanding disclosure requirements related to income taxes. The amendments require enhanced jurisdictional disclosures for the income tax rate reconciliation and related to cash income tax es paid. Additionally, certain disclosures related to unrecognized tax  benefits and indefinite reinvestment assertions were removed. The amendments are effective for our fiscal year ending September 27, 2026. While we are still evaluating the specific impacts and timing of adoption, we anticipate this guidance will have a significant impact on our annual income tax disclosures.\n\nIn March 2024, the SEC issued its final climate disclosure rules, which require the disclosure of climate-related information in annual reports and registration statements. The rules require disclosure in the audited financial statements of certain effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions above certain financial thresholds, as well as amounts related to carbon offsets and renewable energy credits or certificates, if material. Under the rules as originally issued, disclosure requirements begin phasing in for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. However, on April 4, 2024, the SEC determined to voluntarily stay the final rules pending certain legal challenges. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new rules and continue to monitor the status of the related legal challenges.\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance expanding disclosure requirements related to certain income statement expenses. The amendments require tabular disclosure of certain operating expenses disaggregated into categories, such as purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization. The amendments are effective for our fiscal year ending October 1, 2028, and may be applied retrospectively. While we are still evaluating the specific impacts and adoption method, we anticipate this guidance will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## Note 2:    Acquisitions, Div estitures, and Strategic Alliance\n\n## Fiscal 2023\n\nOn January 13, 2023, we sold the assets, primarily consisting of intellectual properties associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand, to Nestl\u00e9 for $110.0 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax  gain of $91.3 million, which was included in gain from sale of assets on our consolidated statement of earnings for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023. Results from Seattle's Best Coffee operations prior to the sale are reported in our Channel Development operating segment.\n\n## Fiscal 2022\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our Evolution Fresh brand and business to Bolthouse Farms. This transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 3:    Deriv ativ e Financial Instruments\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. We enter into interest rate swap agreements, including forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks, settled in cash based upon the difference between an agreed-upon benchmark rate and the prevailing benchmark rate at settlement. These agreements are generally settled around the time of the pricing of the related debt. Each derivative agreement's gain or loss is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt.\n\nTo hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges.

      "question": "How do Lowe's (LOW), Nike (NKE), and Tesla (TSLA) each apply the Black-Scholes option pricing model in their stock-based compensation disclosures, and what do their respective assumptions and methodologies reveal about their approaches to valuing employee stock options?",
      "answer": "Lowe's (LOW) uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock options, incorporating historical and implied volatility, U.S. Treasury yields for the risk-free rate, and expected term based on historical exercise patterns. Nike (NKE) also applies the Black-Scholes model for options and ESPPs, with vesting over four years, and emphasizes the use of observable market inputs in fair value estimation. Tesla (TSLA) utilizes Black-Scholes for stock options with service and performance conditions, noting the subjective nature of inputs like volatility and expected term. While all three use the same model, Lowe's emphasizes forfeiture adjustments and vesting schedules, Nike integrates it within broader equity compensation programs, and Tesla highlights the judgment required in model inputs, reflecting differing levels of complexity and transparency in their application of the model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LOW \u2192 Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model: LOW uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock options, incorporating historical and implied volatility, U.S. Treasury yields for the risk-free rate, and expected term based on historical exercise patterns. The company also adjusts for estimated forfeitures and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.",
        "Hop 2: NKE \u2192 Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model: NKE applies the Black-Scholes model for stock options and employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs), with substantially all awards vesting ratably over four years. The company emphasizes the use of observable market inputs and fair value estimation in its broader stock-based compensation accounting framework.",
        "Hop 3: TSLA \u2192 Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model: TSLA uses the Black-Scholes model for stock options with service and/or performance conditions, noting the subjective and judgment-intensive nature of inputs such as volatility and expected term. The company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures, typically over four years."

      "answer": "Lowe's (LOW) utilizes interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges under the shortcut method, effectively offsetting changes in the fair value of hedged debt with no net impact on earnings. In 2023 and 2022, LOW settled forward interest rate swaps totaling $2.0 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.3 billion, receiving payments of $247 million, $143 million, and $136 million, respectively. Nike (NKE) entered into interest rate swaps where it receives fixed interest payments and pays variable interest based on SOFR plus a spread. As of May 31, 2024, NKE had $1.8 billion in notional value of swaps with interest rates ranging from 4.6% to 5.1%, maturing in fiscal 2034. Starbucks (SBUX) uses interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges to manage variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. SBUX records the gain or loss from these derivatives in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and reclassifies it to interest expense over the life of the related debt. These approaches reveal that LOW focuses on minimizing earnings volatility through fair value hedging, NKE emphasizes long-term variable rate exposure management, and SBUX prioritizes cash flow stability through AOCI deferral.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued guidance related to reference rate reform. The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2024. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued guidance expanding segment disclosure requirements. The amendments require enhanced disclosure for certain segment items and disclosure on how management uses reported measures to assess segment performance. The amendments do not change how segments are determined, aggregated, or how thresholds are applied to determine reportable segments. We expect to adopt the guidance for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2025. We are currently evaluating the expanded disclosure requirements and do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance expanding disclosure requirements related to income taxes. The amendments require enhanced jurisdictional disclosures for the income tax rate reconciliation and related to cash income tax es paid. Additionally, certain disclosures related to unrecognized tax  benefits and indefinite reinvestment assertions were removed. The amendments are effective for our fiscal year ending September 27, 2026. While we are still evaluating the specific impacts and timing of adoption, we anticipate this guidance will have a significant impact on our annual income tax disclosures.\n\nIn March 2024, the SEC issued its final climate disclosure rules, which require the disclosure of climate-related information in annual reports and registration statements. The rules require disclosure in the audited financial statements of certain effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions above certain financial thresholds, as well as amounts related to carbon offsets and renewable energy credits or certificates, if material. Under the rules as originally issued, disclosure requirements begin phasing in for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. However, on April 4, 2024, the SEC determined to voluntarily stay the final rules pending certain legal challenges. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new rules and continue to monitor the status of the related legal challenges.\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance expanding disclosure requirements related to certain income statement expenses. The amendments require tabular disclosure of certain operating expenses disaggregated into categories, such as purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization. The amendments are effective for our fiscal year ending October 1, 2028, and may be applied retrospectively. While we are still evaluating the specific impacts and adoption method, we anticipate this guidance will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## Note 2:    Acquisitions, Div estitures, and Strategic Alliance\n\n## Fiscal 2023\n\nOn January 13, 2023, we sold the assets, primarily consisting of intellectual properties associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand, to Nestl\u00e9 for $110.0 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax  gain of $91.3 million, which was included in gain from sale of assets on our consolidated statement of earnings for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023. Results from Seattle's Best Coffee operations prior to the sale are reported in our Channel Development operating segment.\n\n## Fiscal 2022\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our Evolution Fresh brand and business to Bolthouse Farms. This transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 3:    Deriv ativ e Financial Instruments\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. We enter into interest rate swap agreements, including forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks, settled in cash based upon the difference between an agreed-upon benchmark rate and the prevailing benchmark rate at settlement. These agreements are generally settled around the time of the pricing of the related debt. Each derivative agreement's gain or loss is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt.\n\nTo hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges.

      "question": "How do BKNG, SBUX, and TSLA each utilize U.S. Bank National Association in their debt financing structures, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to long-term capital markets?",
      "answer": "BKNG uses U.S. Bank National Association as a trustee for its senior notes, including the 4.625% Senior Notes due 2030 and 0.750% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025, indicating a structured long-term debt strategy. SBUX engages U.S. Bank National Association in a similar trustee role across multiple bond issuances, including the 3.550% Senior Notes due 2029 and the 3.000% Senior Notes due 2032, reflecting a recurring reliance on long-term fixed-rate financing. TSLA, through its subsidiary SolarCity, has historically used U.S. Bank National Association as a trustee for solar bonds with varying coupon rates and maturities, such as the 4.00% Solar Bonds Series 2015/4-7 and 5.45% Solar Bonds Series 2015/C20-15, suggesting a project-specific financing model tied to asset-backed securities. Collectively, these engagements show BKNG and SBUX leveraging the entity for general corporate debt, while TSLA's usage is more aligned with asset-backed clean energy financing.",

      "question": "How do Lowe's, Starbucks, and Tesla each structure their debt instruments with U.S. Bank National Association, and what does this reveal about their respective financing strategies in 2023?",
      "answer": "Lowe's has a long-standing relationship with U.S. Bank National Association as a trustee for multiple supplemental indentures dating back to 2015, issuing various fixed and floating rate notes with maturities extending to 2050. Starbucks also partners with U.S. Bank National Association, issuing senior notes with specific interest rates (e.g., 2.000%, 2.250%, 3.350%, 3.500%, and 4.800%) and maturities ranging from 2026 to 2050, showing a consistent pattern of structured debt financing. Tesla, through its acquisition of SolarCity, has engaged U.S. Bank National Association in issuing both convertible senior notes (e.g., 2.00% due 2024) and various solar bonds with fixed rates (e.g., 4.70%, 5.45%) and maturity profiles tailored to project financing. The comparative analysis reveals that while all three companies rely on U.S. Bank National Association for debt structuring, their approaches reflect distinct capital strategies: Lowe's focuses on long-term fixed and floating rate instruments, Starbucks on diversified senior notes, and Tesla on project-linked convertible and solar bonds.",

      "answer": "Amazon emphasizes the registration and legal protection of copyrights as part of a broader intellectual property strategy critical to its diverse business operations, including digital media and e-commerce platforms. Booking Holdings relies on copyrights as part of its broader intellectual property portfolio, particularly in supporting its technology platforms and secure communications, which are essential for connecting with vendors and partners globally. Nike highlights its use of copyrights to protect designs, graphics, software applications, and digital goods, aligning with its focus on innovation and branding in athletic footwear and apparel. These differences reveal that while all three companies value copyrights, Amazon focuses on platform and media protection, Booking Holdings on technology and secure systems, and Nike on design and digital experiences, reflecting their distinct business priorities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMZN \u2192 Copyrights: Amazon explicitly states that it has registered or applied for the registration of a number of U.S. and international copyrights, underscoring their importance to its proprietary technologies and digital media offerings.",
        "Hop 2: BKNG \u2192 Copyrights: Booking Holdings mentions that it relies on intellectual property such as copyrights to support its business, particularly in the context of technology systems and secure communications with partners.",
        "Hop 3: NKE \u2192 Copyrights: Nike states it has copyright protection in its designs, graphics, software applications, and digital goods, and that it obtains registered copyrights when appropriate, aligning with its innovation-driven product strategy."

NKE discusses its reliance on manufacturers and the risks posed by climate change, extreme weather, and natural disasters that could disrupt production and delivery timelines. SBUX notes concerns about worsening terms with manufacturers due to global or local conditions and the impact of supply chain disruptions on product availability and cost. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies depend heavily on manufacturers, HD focuses on compliance and sourcing diversification, NKE emphasizes environmental and operational risks, and SBUX highlights contractual and cost-related vulnerabilities.",

      "answer": "Nike leases an office complex in Shanghai that serves as its headquarters for the Greater China geography, focusing on wholesale, Nike Direct, and merchandising strategies. Starbucks has a 225,000 square foot administrative facility in Shanghai, indicating a significant but more modest presence focused on regional management. Tesla has a long-term 50-year operating lease for land use rights in Shanghai where it has constructed Gigafactory Shanghai, committing to RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures and RMB 2.23 billion in annual tax revenues. This reveals that Tesla is making a large-scale, long-term manufacturing and investment commitment in Shanghai, while Nike and Starbucks maintain more administrative and commercial-focused presences, with Nike emphasizing regional market execution and Starbucks maintaining a smaller footprint relative to its global scale.",

      "answer": "AMZN reported $68.1 billion and $72.2 billion in gross assets acquired under finance leases\u2014including vehicles\u2014as of the end of 2020 and 2021, respectively, indicating a significant reliance on leased vehicles to support its logistics and delivery operations. GM disclosed that it sells vehicles directly or through dealers to fleet customers, with fleet sales making up a notable portion of its total vehicle sales, though these are generally less profitable than retail sales. TSLA included vehicles in its finished goods inventory, highlighting that new and used vehicles are a core part of its product offerings and directly tied to customer fulfillment. Together, these perspectives show that while vehicles are central to all three companies, they serve distinctly different roles: AMZN depends on vehicles for delivery infrastructure, GM focuses on fleet and retail sales, and TSLA treats vehicles as direct consumer products.",

      "answer": "BKNG adopted a formal dividend policy in early 2024 and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $8.75 per share, signaling a shift toward returning value to shareholders. SBUX maintains a flexible approach, with dividend decisions left to board discretion based on operating performance and capital needs, though it did not specify any new dividend payments in the disclosed period. TSLA, on the other hand, has never declared or paid cash dividends and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future, emphasizing reinvestment of earnings to support growth. Together, these approaches reflect differing capital allocation strategies: BKNG prioritizes shareholder returns through structured dividends, SBUX remains cautiously discretionary, and TSLA focuses on internal reinvestment for expansion.",

      "answer": "BKNG discusses PCI DSS in the context of increased compliance costs and operational complexity as their payment processing activities grow, noting potential liability for data breaches and the need for periodic audits. HD emphasizes their adherence to PCI DSS as part of a broader cybersecurity framework aligned with NIST standards, highlighting structured risk management, audits, and a dedicated cybersecurity team. LOW acknowledges PCI DSS compliance as part of their broader payments-related risk exposure, noting the challenges of evolving regulations and the potential for increased costs and operational disruptions due to cybersecurity threats. Together, these perspectives reveal differing focal points: BKNG emphasizes liability and cost, HD focuses on structured compliance and risk governance, and LOW highlights evolving threats and regulatory adaptation.",

      "question": "How do GM, HD, and LOW each describe the financial and operational challenges they face in complying with evolving data privacy regulations, and what do their disclosures reveal about the varying degrees of exposure and mitigation strategies across the automotive, home improvement retail, and broader consumer discretionary sectors?",
      "answer": "GM highlights that increasingly complex data privacy regulations negatively impact its ability to manage enterprise data practices, particularly concerning the collection, use, sharing, and security of personal information from customers, employees, and suppliers. HD states that evolving data privacy and cybersecurity requirements require significant effort and cost, necessitate changes to business practices, and may limit its ability to collect and use data to support the customer experience. LOW notes that its omnichannel strategy is constrained by external factors such as data privacy legislation, which affects its ability to collect, use, and share customer data for personalization and marketing. Collectively, these disclosures indicate that while all three companies face compliance costs and operational limitations due to data privacy regulations, GM emphasizes risk to data practices, HD focuses on regulatory enforcement and reputational impact, and LOW centers on strategic limitations in digital retail execution.",

        "Hop 1: GM \u2192 Data Privacy Regulations: GM explicitly states that increasingly complex, restrictive, and punitive regulations relating to enterprise data practices negatively impact its operations and risk management strategies.",

      "answer": "Amazon describes domain names as critical to its success and states that it has registered or applied for numerous U.S. and international domain names to protect its proprietary rights. Booking Holdings emphasizes its reliance on domain names and other intangible rights secured through purchase, licensing, or agreements, underscoring their importance in supporting its technology-driven travel platform. Starbucks notes that it has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including 'Starbucks.com,' 'Starbucks.net,' and 'Starbucksreserve.com,' which are integral to its brand and digital presence. Together, these perspectives highlight the strategic importance of domain names as part of each company\u2019s digital identity and brand protection strategy within the consumer discretionary sector.",

Our public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customers shop at Lowe's, our vendors want to do business with Lowe's, and our associates want to work for Lowe's. We must continue to manage, preserve, and grow Lowe's public image and reputation. Lowe's actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation. In addition, failure to meet our stated environmental and social objectives, and consumer, shareholder, and other stakeholder concerns about our environmental and social practices are potential sources of reputational risk. V endors and others with whom we do business may affect our reputation. Any negative incident can erode trust and confidence quickly, and adverse publicity about us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers' confidence, reduce demand for our products and services, affect our relationships with current and future vendors, impact our results of operations, affect our ability to recruit, retain, and engage our associates, and attract regulatory scrutiny. The significant ex pansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incidents. We have been, and in the future may be, subject to criticism in the media and negative social media campaigns related to certain initiatives, including those related to diversity and inclusion, and changes in those initiatives. Widespread dissemination of such criticism at times may adversely impact our relationships with our associates, customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders. In addition, the use of social media platforms and other technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination and given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other actions.\n\nAdditionally, our proprietary rights in our trademarks, trade names, service marks, domain names, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets of our business. We may not be able to prevent or even discover every instance of unauthorized third-party uses of our intellectual property or dilution of our brand names, such as when a third party uses trademarks that are identical or similar to our own. If we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers, expose us to litigation and negatively impact our sales, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.\n\nProduct and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in Lowe's and our brand image. If our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety or quality, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial, and reputational risks. As a result, Lowe's reputation as a retailer of high-quality products and services, including both national and Lowe's private brands, could suffer and impact customer loyalty. Additionally, we and our customers have expectations on responsible sourcing and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Under our Vendor Code of Conduct, our vendors are required to meet our expectations across multiple areas of compliance, including health and safety, environmental standards, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. Where appropriate, we request that our vendors provide additional documentation proving their compliance in these areas. If we need to seek alternative sources of supply from vendors with whom we have less familiarity, the risk of our standards not being met may increase. Actual, potential, or perceived product safety concerns or vendor non-compliance exposes us to litigation, as well as government enforcement action, and could, and in certain instances in the past has, resulted in costly product recalls, the inability to sell certain products due to customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and exclusions, and other liabilities.\n\nOur sales and profitability depend on our ability to maintain our store base and maintain appropriate levels of inventory and failure to do so may affect our business, financial condition and result of operations.\n\nWe have a store base that requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. Our capital investments in our stores may not deliver the convenience or relevant shopping experience our customers expect. It is important that we maintain appropriate levels of inventory in our stores and supply chain facilities and respond to changing customer demands. We must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates, as well as to protect against loss or theft of our inventory (known as 'shrink'). Higher rates of shrink, which we have experienced from time to time, including as a result of organized retail crime, can require operational changes that may increase costs and adversely impact customer and associate experience.",

O ur ability to m eet custom er expectations, m anage inventory, com plete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, particularly in em erging m arkets, depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities, the developm ent or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the tim ely perform ance of services by third parties (including those involved in shipping product to and from  our distribution facilities). O ur distribution facilities have in the past and could in the future be interrupted by inform ation technology problem s, disasters such as earthquakes or fires or outbreaks of disease or governm ent actions taken to m itigate their spread. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business. W e maintain business interruption insurance, but it m ay not adequately protect us from  adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities.\n\n## Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks\n\nWe are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAs a m ultinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world, we are subject to and m ust com ply with extensive laws and regulations in the U nited States and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels. If we or our em ployees, agents, suppliers, and other partners fail to com ply with any of these laws or regulations, such failure could subject us to fines, sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Furtherm ore, laws, regulations and policies and the interpretation of such, can conflict am ong jurisdictions and com pliance in one jurisdiction m ay result in legal or reputational risks in another jurisdiction. W e are involved in various types of claim s, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and governm ent investigations relating to our business, our products and the actions of our em ployees and representatives, including contractual and em ploym ent relationships, product liability, antitrust, tradem ark rights and a variety of other matters. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcom e of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations, and we could in the future incur judgm ents, fines or penalties, or enter into settlem ents of lawsuits and claim s that could have a m aterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and negatively im pact our reputation. T he global nature of our business m eans legal and com pliance risks, such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption, fraud, trade, environm ental, com petition, privacy and other regulatory m atters, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies have and will continue to arise from  tim e to tim e, which could adversely affect us. I n addition, the adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, m ay result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks. M oreover, the regulation of certain transactions we engage in, including those involving virtual goods and cryptocurrencies, rem ains in an early stage and subject to significant uncertainty. As a result, we are required to exercise our judgm ent as to whether or how certain laws or regulations apply, or m ay in the future apply, and it is possible that legislators, regulators and courts m ay disagree with our conclusions. Any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert m anagem ent's attention from  our operations and result in substantial legal fees.\n\nChanges to U.S. or other countries' trade policies and tariff and import/export regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nChanges in the U .S. governm ent's im port and export policies, including trade restrictions, sanctions and countersanctions, increased tariffs or quotas, em bargoes, safeguards or custom s restrictions, could require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nI n addition, changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade, m anufacturing, developm ent and investm ent in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business could adversely affect our business. U .S. presidential adm inistrations have instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or term ination of trade agreem ents, the im position of higher tariffs on im ports into the U .S., econom ic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other governm ent regulations affecting trade between the U .S. and other countries where we conduct our business. It m ay be tim e-consum ing and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or com ply with any such changes.\n\nChanges or proposed changes in U .S. or other countries' trade policies m ay result in restrictions and econom ic disincentives on international trade. T ariffs and other changes in U .S. trade policy have in the past and could in the future trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governm ents have instituted or are considering im posing retaliatory m easures on certain U .S. goods. F urther, any em erging protectionist or nationalist trends either in the U nited States or in other countries could affect the trade environm ent.

For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality. While we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our products and their systems, malicious entities have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain control of, or to change, our products' functionality, user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products. We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting policy, and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability. However, there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can be identified, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful.\n\nAny unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or government investigations. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products, their systems or data are capable of being hacked, may harm our brand, prospects and operating results. We have been the subject of such reports in the past.\n\n## Our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities.\n\nIt is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as ours to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies' operations. Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees, they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union signatory. From time to time, labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations, as part of which such unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board (the 'NLRB'), and they may do so in the future. Any unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Tesla's treatment of our employees. Furthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as suppliers and trucking and freight companies. Any work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and may harm our business and operating results.\n\n## We may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions.\n\nAs a manufacturing company, we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products. Recalls for our vehicles have resulted from various hardware and software-related safety or non-compliance determinations. In addition to recalls initiated by us for various causes, testing of or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that contradicts it. In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls or field actions if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations, such as U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, or provide certain functionalities. Such recalls or field actions, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could result in significant expense, supply chain complications and service burdens, and may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims.\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to customers. We also provide certain warranties with respect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell, including on their installation and maintenance. For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers' warranties, but may retain some warranty responsibilities for some or all of the life of such components. As part of our energy generation and storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that guarantee that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the contract. Under these performance guarantees, we generally bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls, including in some cases shortfalls caused by failures in components from third party manufacturers. These risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties.",

      "answer": "AMZN highlights that failure to optimize inventory management increases net shipping costs by affecting shipment distances and volumes, and notes that under some commercial agreements, they maintain inventory for other companies, which adds complexity to their fulfillment network. LOW emphasizes that maintaining appropriate inventory levels is critical to their business, and inventory shrink, including from organized retail crime, has increased costs and impacted customer and associate experience. NKE states that forecasting errors could lead to excess inventory requiring write-downs or inventory shortages that delay shipments, harm customer relationships, and reduce brand loyalty. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are exposed to inventory mismanagement risks, AMZN faces complexity from third-party inventory, LOW is impacted by shrink and store-level execution, and NKE is particularly vulnerable to demand volatility due to its direct-to-consumer model and advance purchasing from manufacturers.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn addition, failure to optimize inventory management or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by increasing the distance products are shipped and reducing the number of units per shipment or delivery. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. For example, productivity across our fulfillment network is affected by regional labor market constraints, which increase payroll costs and make it difficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like.\n\nUnder some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to adequately predict seller demand for storage or to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.\n\nWe rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties ex perienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems, including as a result of labor market constraints and related costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or ex treme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events.\n\n## We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Incidents\n\nBecause we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, classified, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information, failure to prevent, detect, or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, or other security incidents or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors' or customers' technology, products, and systems, could: expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security incidents, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent, detect, or mitigate such incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security incident at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented.\n\n## We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy\n\nWe experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. Steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nOur computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures (including from energy shortages), and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.\n\n## The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business\n\nWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel, including our President and CEO. We do not have 'key person' life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate, as well as senior management, has historically been intense. For example, we experience",

Our public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customers shop at Lowe's, our vendors want to do business with Lowe's, and our associates want to work for Lowe's. We must continue to manage, preserve, and grow Lowe's public image and reputation. Lowe's actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation. In addition, failure to meet our stated environmental and social objectives, and consumer, shareholder, and other stakeholder concerns about our environmental and social practices are potential sources of reputational risk. V endors and others with whom we do business may affect our reputation. Any negative incident can erode trust and confidence quickly, and adverse publicity about us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers' confidence, reduce demand for our products and services, affect our relationships with current and future vendors, impact our results of operations, affect our ability to recruit, retain, and engage our associates, and attract regulatory scrutiny. The significant ex pansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incidents. We have been, and in the future may be, subject to criticism in the media and negative social media campaigns related to certain initiatives, including those related to diversity and inclusion, and changes in those initiatives. Widespread dissemination of such criticism at times may adversely impact our relationships with our associates, customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders. In addition, the use of social media platforms and other technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination and given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other actions.\n\nAdditionally, our proprietary rights in our trademarks, trade names, service marks, domain names, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets of our business. We may not be able to prevent or even discover every instance of unauthorized third-party uses of our intellectual property or dilution of our brand names, such as when a third party uses trademarks that are identical or similar to our own. If we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers, expose us to litigation and negatively impact our sales, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.\n\nProduct and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in Lowe's and our brand image. If our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety or quality, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial, and reputational risks. As a result, Lowe's reputation as a retailer of high-quality products and services, including both national and Lowe's private brands, could suffer and impact customer loyalty. Additionally, we and our customers have expectations on responsible sourcing and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Under our Vendor Code of Conduct, our vendors are required to meet our expectations across multiple areas of compliance, including health and safety, environmental standards, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. Where appropriate, we request that our vendors provide additional documentation proving their compliance in these areas. If we need to seek alternative sources of supply from vendors with whom we have less familiarity, the risk of our standards not being met may increase. Actual, potential, or perceived product safety concerns or vendor non-compliance exposes us to litigation, as well as government enforcement action, and could, and in certain instances in the past has, resulted in costly product recalls, the inability to sell certain products due to customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and exclusions, and other liabilities.\n\nOur sales and profitability depend on our ability to maintain our store base and maintain appropriate levels of inventory and failure to do so may affect our business, financial condition and result of operations.\n\nWe have a store base that requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. Our capital investments in our stores may not deliver the convenience or relevant shopping experience our customers expect. It is important that we maintain appropriate levels of inventory in our stores and supply chain facilities and respond to changing customer demands. We must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates, as well as to protect against loss or theft of our inventory (known as 'shrink'). Higher rates of shrink, which we have experienced from time to time, including as a result of organized retail crime, can require operational changes that may increase costs and adversely impact customer and associate experience.",

HD uses interest rate swaps to manage its fixed/floating-rate debt portfolio, with $6.0 billion of floating-rate debt principal and a $795 million liability position in swaps as of February 2, 2025, and a one percentage point rate increase would raise its annual interest expense by $60 million. NKE has $1.8 billion in notional value of interest rate swaps tied to SOFR plus a spread, with rates ranging from 4.6% to 5.1%, and these swaps mature in fiscal 2034.

During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill due to the use of preliminary information in our initial estimates. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n\n## MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES\n\nWe value the majority of our inv entory under the retail inv entory method, with the remainder of our inv entories v alued under a cost method, primarily the first-in, first-out method. Under the retail inv entory method, inv entories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail v alue of inv entories.\n\nThe retail v alue of our inv entory is adjusted as needed to reflect current market conditions. Because these adjustments are based on current prev ailing market conditions, the v alue of our inv entory approximates the lower of cost or market. The v aluation under the retail inv entory method is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inv entory losses (or shrink). As such, there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inv entory cost and gross profit. We determine markups and markdowns based on the consideration of a v ariety of factors such as current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and buying trends, age of the merchandise, and weather conditions.\n\nWe calculate shrink based on actual inv entory losses identified as a result of physical inv entory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inv entory losses occurring between physical inv entory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inv entory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. A 10% increase in the shrink rate used to estimate our inv entory shrink reserv e would hav e increased cost of sales by approximately $95 million for fiscal 2024. Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inv entory losses has not been material to our annual financial results.\n\nWe do not believ e there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to v alue our inv entory under the retail inv entory method. We believ e that the retail inv entory method prov ides an inv entory v aluation which approximates cost and results in v aluing our inv entory at the lower of cost or market.\n\n## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nFor information on our accounting policies and on accounting pronouncements that hav e impacted or may materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Item 7A . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures A bout Market Risk.\n\n## INTEREST RATE RISK\n\nWe have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our long-term debt portfolio. We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed/floating-rate debt portfolio, none of which are for trading or speculativ e purposes. At February 2, 2025, after giv ing consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, floating-rate debt principal was $6.0 billion, or approximately 12% of our senior notes portfolio. Our interest rate swap agreements were in an aggregate liability position of $795 million at February 2, 2025. The changes in the fair v alues of our interest rate swap agreements offset the changes in the fair v alue of the hedged long-term debt. Based on our February 2, 2025 floating-rate debt principal, a one percentage point increase in the interest rate of floating-rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $60 million.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK\n\nWe are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. We use deriv ativ e instruments to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk, none of which are for trading or speculativ e purposes.

The Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding the many safety standards is costly as global compliance and non-governmental assessment requirements continue to evolve and grow more complex, and lack harmonization globally. The Safety Act further requires that if we or NHTSA determine a vehicle or an item of vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard, or that vehicle or equipment contains a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk, we must conduct a safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicles. Should we or NHTSA determine a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.\n\nOther National Requirements Outside of the U.S., many countries have established vehicle safety standards and regulations and are likely to adopt additional, more stringent requirements in the future. The European General Safety Regulation has introduced United  Nations  Economic  Commission  for  Europe  (UN-ECE)  regulations,  which  are  required  for  the  European  Type Approval process.  Globally,  governments  generally  have  been  adopting  UN-ECE  based  regulations  with  some  variations  to  address  local concerns.  Any  difference  between  North  American  and  UN-ECE  based  regulations  can  add  complexity  and  costs  to  vehicle development, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce complexity. New safety and recall requirements in various countries around the world, including in China, Brazil, and Gulf Cooperation Council countries, also may add substantial costs  and  complexity  to  our  safety  and  field  action  activities  globally.  In  Canada,  vehicle  regulatory  requirements  are  currently aligned  with  U.S.  regulations;  however,  under  the  Canadian  Motor  Vehicle  Safety  Act,  recall  thresholds  are  different  and  the Minister of Transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or non-compliance when the Minister considers it to be in the interest of safety. Further, various governments are beginning to mandate e-Call and other features that can be market-specific and add complexity and increase our cost of compliance globally.\n\nCrash Test Ratings and New Car Assessment Programs Organizations in various regions around the world, including in the U.S., rate and compare motor vehicles through various New Car Assessment Programs (NCAPs) to provide consumers and businesses with additional information about the safety of new vehicles. NCAPs use crash tests and other evaluations that are different than what is required by applicable regulations, and use stars to rate vehicle safety, with five stars awarded for the highest rating and one for the lowest. Achieving high NCAP ratings, which can vary by country and region, can add complexity and cost to vehicles.\n\nWebsite Access to Our Reports Our internet website address is https://www.gm.com.

Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility.\n\nUnder this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million 'program payment' to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us.\n\nAs we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at Gigafactory New York pursuant to a New York State executive order issued in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were granted a deferral of our obligation to be compliant with our applicable targets through December 31, 2021 in an amendment memorialized in August 2021. The amendment also extended our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. As of December 31, 2021, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations following this expected deferral or in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make substantial payments to the SUNY Foundation.\n\n## Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China\n\nWe have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we are constructing Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures by the end of 2023 and to generate RMB 2.23 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. If we are unwilling or unable to meet such target or obtain periodic project approvals, in accordance with the Chinese government's standard terms for such arrangements, we would be required to revert the site to the local government and receive compensation for the remaining value of the land lease, buildings and fixtures. We expect to meet the capital expenditure and tax revenue requirements based on our current level of spend and sales.",

GM Financial also uses interest rate and foreign currency swaps to hedge both fair value and cash flow risks, with certain swaps designated as fair value or cash flow hedges impacting interest and operating expenses. MCD uses interest rate swaps and foreign currency swaps as part of its broader debt and risk management strategy, and in 2021, it terminated certain swaps while managing $12.8 billion in foreign currency-denominated debt. SBUX employs swaps as part of its derivative portfolio to hedge interest rate and foreign currency risks, with such instruments recorded at fair value and typically not exceeding three years in maturity, except in specific hedging cases.

The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  whose  local  currency  is  not  their  functional  currency  are  remeasured  from  their  local  currency  to  their  functional currency and then translated to U.S. Dollars. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars using the average exchange rates prevailing for each period presented. The financial statements of any foreign subsidiary that has been identified as having a highly inflationary economy are remeasured as if the functional currency were the U.S. Dollar.\n\nGains  and  losses  arising  from  foreign  currency  transactions  and  the  effects  of  remeasurements  discussed  in  the  preceding paragraph are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales and GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses unless related to Automotive debt, which are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Foreign currency transaction and remeasurement gains were $17 million, losses of $203 million and gains of $85 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. The accounting  for  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  each  derivative  financial  instrument  depends  on  whether  it  has  been  designated  and qualifies  as  an  accounting  hedge,  as  well  as  the  type  of  hedging  relationship  identified.  Derivative  instruments  are  not  used  for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nAutomotive We utilize options, swaps and forward contracts to manage foreign currency and commodity price risk. The change in fair value of option and forward contracts not designated as hedges is recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Cash flows for all derivative financial instruments are classified in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nWe estimate the fair value of the Stellantis warrants using a Black-Scholes formula. The significant inputs to the model include the Stellantis stock price and the estimated dividend yield. We are entitled to receive any dividends declared by Stellantis through the conversion date upon exercise of the warrants. Gains or losses as a result of the change in the fair value of the Stellantis warrants are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net.\n\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial GM Financial utilizes interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk. The change in fair value of the derivative instruments not designated as hedges is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. Cash flows for all derivative financial instruments are classified in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nCertain interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as fair value hedges. The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate or the risk of changes in fair value attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the swap has been designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. The change in fair value of the related hedge is also recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nCertain interest rate swap and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges. The risk being hedged is  the  interest  rate  and foreign currency risk related to forecasted transactions. If the contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the cash flow hedge is deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is recognized in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses along with the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded currently in earnings and are presented in the same income statement line as the earnings effect of the hedged item.",

These effects are excluded as they have no impact on the obligation at maturity. See the Debt Financing footnote on page 57 of this Form 10-K.\n\n(3) Includes the effect of interest rate swaps used to hedge debt.\n\nStandard &amp; Poor's and Moody's currently rate the Company's commercial paper A-2 and P-2, respectively, and its long-term debt BBB+ and Baa1, respectively. To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings.\n\nCertain of the Company's debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company's debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company's business. In December 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized $15 billion of borrowing capacity with no specified expiration date, of which $8.3 billion remains outstanding as of December 31, 2021. These borrowings may include (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In April 2020, the Company's Board of Directors provided additional authorization to issue commercial paper and draw on lines of credit agreements up to $8 billion in addition to the $15 billion authorized as referenced above. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the SEC and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $4.5 billion available under committed line of credit agreements (see the Debt Financing footnote on page 57 of this Form 10-K). As of December 31, 2021, the Company's subsidiaries also had $263 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements.\n\nThe Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments.\n\nIn managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders' equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $12.8 billion and $13.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company's restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies footnote related to financial instruments and hedging activities on page 47 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.\n\nThe Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2021 , neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company's supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.",

Any adjustments as a result of price changes or impairments are recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nFair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. For assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, we determine fair value based on the following:\n\nLevel 1: The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For equity and U.S. government treasury securities and commodity futures contracts, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value.\n\nLevel 2: When quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, we determine the fair value of certain assets based upon factors such as the quoted market price of similar assets or a discounted cash flow model using readily observable market data, which may include interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities, depending on the nature of the investment. The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities.\n\nLevel 3: We determine the fair value of our auction rate securities using an internally-developed valuation model, using inputs that include interest rate curves, credit and liquidity spreads and effective maturity.\n\nAssets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis may include items such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments and other assets. We determine the fair value of these items using Level 3 inputs, as described in the related sections below.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nWe manage our exposure to various risks within our consolidated financial statements according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency-denominated revenue streams, inventory purchases, assets and liabilities and investments in certain foreign operations. In order to manage our exposure to these risks, we use various types of derivative instruments including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of a purchased call option and a sold put option with equal premiums to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows, or to limit possible gains or losses on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nWe record all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and typically do not offset derivative assets and liabilities. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency debt hedging instruments, we generally do not enter into derivative instruments with maturities longer than three years. However, we are allowed to net settle transactions with respective counterparties for certain derivative contracts, inclusive of interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards, with a single, net amount payable by one party to the other. We also enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. As of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, cash collateral held under collateral security arrangements was $74.3 million and $44.7 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. As of October 2, 2022, cash collateral pledged as part of our commodity derivative margin requirements was $75.6 million and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. As of October 3, 2021, cash collateral pledged as part of our commodity derivative margin requirements was $72.5 million and is included in cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets. The potential effects of netting arrangements with our derivative contracts, excluding the effects of collateral, would not have had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nBy using these derivative instruments, we expose ourselves to potential credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with carefully selected, credit-worthy counterparties and distribute contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the derivative's gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive income ('OCI') and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') on our consolidated balance sheets. The gain or loss is subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings, in the same line item as the underlying hedged item on our consolidated statements of earnings.",

The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at $100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0 billion thereafter (based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been achieved for the four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial statements filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation.

Costs associated with the acquisition and development of software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to seven years. Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.\n\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing their undiscounted future cash flows with their carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows, we then measure the asset's fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. If the resulting fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. Impairment losses on property and equipment are recorded as a component of SG&amp;A. Impairment charges for long-lived assets were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, or fiscal 2019.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe enter into contractual arrangements for the utilization of certain non-owned assets which are evaluated as finance or operating leases upon commencement, and are accounted for accordingly.

We assess whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception of the contract.\n\nWe lease certain retail locations, warehouse and distribution space, office space, equipment, and vehicles.

CYBERSECURITY\n\n## Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, ex tortion, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws.\n\nIdentifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity risks related to our business, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach including third party assessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews. To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we, among other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration testing using external third-party tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability reporting, conduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including our consumer products) and implement appropriate changes.\n\nWe have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected stages: 1) preparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and recovery, and 4) post-incident analysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity.\n\nSecurity events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents are evaluated to determine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact.\n\nWe also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals then collaborate with technical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form detection, mitigation and remediation strategies.\n\nAs part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and compliance with applicable practices and standards. As of 2024, our Information Security Management System has been certified to conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.\n\nOur risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third parties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service providers. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated when determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers and potential fourth-party risks when handling and/or processing our employee, business or customer data. In addition to new vendor onboarding, we perform risk management during third-party cybersecurity compromise incidents to identify and mitigate risks to us from third-party incidents.\n\nWe describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the heading 'Our information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences' included as part of our risk factor disclosures at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Cybersecurity Governance\n\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. Our Audit Committee is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. Members of the Audit Committee receive updates on a quarterly basis from senior management, including leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity. This includes existing and new cybersecurity risks, status on how management is addressing and/or mitigating those risks, cybersecurity and data privacy incidents (if any) and status on key information security initiatives. Our Board members also engage in ad hoc conversations with management on cybersecurity-related news events and discuss any updates to our cybersecurity risk management and strategy programs.",

      "answer": "BKNG includes its List of Subsidiaries as Exhibit 21 in its 2023 10-K filing, indicating a formalized and centralized structure with a long list of exhibits tied to executive agreements and credit arrangements. LOW also includes its List of Subsidiaries as Exhibit 21.1 in its 10-K, but with minimal cross-referencing, suggesting a more streamlined or internally managed subsidiary structure. TSLA explicitly lists its subsidiaries as Exhibit 21.1 in its 10-K and marks it as 'Filed Herewith,' indicating a direct and self-contained disclosure approach.

      "question": "How do Amazon, General Motors, and Tesla each assess their strategic positioning relative to Rivian, and what does this reveal about the competitive dynamics in the electric vehicle market?",
      "answer": "Amazon views Rivian primarily as a strategic investment valued at $15.6 billion as of Q1 2022, with contractual and regulatory restrictions affecting its ability to liquidate the stake until mid-2022. General Motors sees Rivian as part of a broader wave of non-traditional entrants disrupting the automotive industry, intensifying the competitive pressure to innovate and accelerate its EV and AV development. Tesla, while not directly mentioning Rivian, highlights the intense competition for skilled personnel and the challenges posed by both established automakers and emerging EV startups, reflecting a broader concern about market saturation and talent acquisition in the EV space. Together, these perspectives illustrate a multi-faceted competitive landscape where Rivian plays a role as both a disruptor and a benchmark in the evolving EV market.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nWe  have  listed  below  the  most  material  risk  factors  applicable  to  us.  These  risk  factors  are  not  necessarily  in  the  order  of importance or probability of occurrence:\n\n## Risks related to our competition and strategy\n\nIf we do not deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry, our business could suffer. We believe that the automotive industry will  continue  to  experience  significant  change  in  the  coming  years,  particularly  as  traditional  automotive  original  equipment manufacturers shift resources to the development of EVs. In addition to our traditional competitors, we must also be responsive to the  entrance  of  start-ups  and  other  non-traditional  competitors  in  the  automotive  industry.  These  new  competitors,  as  well  as established  industry  participants,  are  disrupting  the  historic  business  model  of  our  industry  through  the  introduction  of  new technologies, products, services, direct-to-consumer  sales channels, methods  of  transportation  and  vehicle  ownership.  To successfully execute our long-term strategy, we must continue to develop new products and services, including products and services that  are  outside  of  our  historically  core  ICE  business,  such  as  EVs  and A Vs, software-enabled connected services and other new businesses.\n\nOur vehicles and connected services increasingly rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and complex. The process of designing and developing new technology, products and services is costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit the best talent. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained, if costs of capital increased significantly, or if our ability to raise capital is challenged relative to our peers, in each case including as a result of any constraints  on  lending  due  to  concerns  about  climate  change,  our  ability  to  execute  on  our  strategic  plans  could  be  adversely affected. Further, the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our strategic plans.\n\nThere can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way, if at all, that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do, or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage. Further, if we are unable to prevent or effectively remedy errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects in our software and hardware, or fail to deploy updates to our software properly, or if we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed.\n\nOur ability  to  maintain  profitability  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  timely  fund  and  introduce  new  and  improved  vehicle models, including EVs, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers. We operate in a very competitive industry with market  participants  routinely  introducing  new  and  improved  vehicle  models  and  features  designed  to  meet  rapidly  evolving consumer expectations. Producing new and improved vehicle models, including EVs, that preserve our reputation for designing, building and selling safe, high-quality cars, trucks and SUVs is critical to our long-term profitability. Successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability. The new vehicle development process can take two years or more, and a number of factors may lengthen that time period. Because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers' acceptance of new vehicle designs, including competitors' product introductions, technological innovations, fuel prices, general economic conditions, regulatory developments, transportation infrastructure and changes in quality, safety, reliability and styling demands and preferences, an initial product concept or design may not result in a saleable vehicle or a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable. Our high proportion of fixed costs, both due to our significant investment in property, plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements, which limit our flexibility  to  adjust  personnel  costs  to  changes  in  demands  for  our  products,  may  further  exacerbate  the  risks  associated  with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles.\n\nOur  long-term  strategy  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  profitably  deliver  a  broad  portfolio  of  EVs. The  production  and profitable sale of EVs has become increasingly important to our long-term business as we accelerate our transition to an all-electric future.  In  2021,  we  increased  our  commitment to investments in EV and AV technologies to more than $35.0 billion from 2020 through 2025, with plans to launch more than 30 new EV models globally across several price points in that timeframe. Our EV strategy  is  dependent  on  our  ability  to  deliver  a  broad  portfolio  of  high-quality  EVs  that  are  competitive  and  meet  consumer demands; reduce the costs associated with the manufacture of EVs, particularly with respect to batteries; increase vehicle range and the energy density of our batteries; license and monetize our proprietary platforms and related innovations; successfully invest in new technologies relative to our peers; develop new software and services; and leverage our scale, manufacturing capabilities and synergies with existing ICE vehicles.",

Moreover, we may be impacted by perceptions relating to reductions in force that we have conducted in the past in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce costs and the departure of certain senior personnel for various reasons. Likewise, as a result of our temporary suspension of various U.S. manufacturing operations in the first half of 2020, in April 2020, we temporarily furloughed certain hourly employees and reduced most salaried employees' base salaries. We also compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and start-ups and emerging companies that promise short-term growth opportunities.\n\nFinally, our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins, with an emphasis on equity-based awards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders. We periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards available under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans. If we are unable to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals for such future increases, we may have to expend additional cash to compensate our employees and our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel may be harmed.\n\n## We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer.\n\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer. Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla. Mr. Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles, and is involved in other emerging technology ventures.\n\nOur information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences.\n\nWe continue to expand our information technology systems as our operations grow, such as product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. This includes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the U.S. and abroad. While, we maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-attacks or misappropriation, our systems and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, social engineering, computer hacking, unauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects and vulnerabilities, breakdowns, damage, interruptions, system malfunctions, power outages, terrorism, acts of vandalism, security breaches, security incidents, inadvertent or intentional actions by employees or other third parties, and other cyber-attacks.\n\nTo the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition, use, corruption, loss, destruction, alteration or dissemination of our data, including intellectual property and personal information, or our products or vehicles, or for it to be believed or reported that any of these occurred, it could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable data breach notification laws, subject us to time consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm.\n\nWe also rely on service providers, and similar incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks. Our service providers, including our workforce management software provider, have been subject to ransomware and other security incidents, and we cannot guarantee that our or our service providers' systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident, or other disruption to, our or our service providers' systems. Our ability to monitor our service providers' security measures is limited, and, in any event, malicious third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures.\n\nFurther, the implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost, and there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating current systems, including disruptions to the related areas of business operation. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service products, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations.\n\nMoreover, if we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to accurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results.

      "answer": "BKNG primarily uses the income approach for impairment evaluation, with key unobservable inputs such as weighted average cost of capital (10.5%-14.5%) and terminal EBITDA multiple (14x-16x), and also uses pricing models for derivative valuation, which are classified as Level 2. LOW determines fair value using pricing models with observable market inputs for Level 2 assets and uses an income approach with unobservable inputs like volatility and expected term for its Level 3 contingent consideration. MCD values derivatives using pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses incorporating observable parameters such as interest rate yield curves and foreign currency rates, and classifies these as Level 2, while also acknowledging the need for credit risk adjustments. Collectively, this shows that while all three companies use pricing models, they differ in the specific approaches (market vs. income vs. hybrid), the nature of inputs (observable vs. unobservable), and the hierarchy levels applied.",

GM similarly posts Form 8-K reports on its Investor Relations website (https://investor.gm.com) promptly after filing and highlights the availability of governance documents and material updates on its corporate site. MCD provides Form 8-K filings through its investor website (www.investor.mcdonalds.com) and emphasizes that these reports are available 'as soon as reasonably practicable' post-filing, with additional access via www.sec.gov or by calling a dedicated investor line.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Vehicle Safety\n\nU.S. Requirements The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the Safety Act) regulates the vehicles and items of motor vehicle equipment that we manufacture and sell. The Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding the many safety standards is costly as global compliance and non-governmental assessment requirements continue to evolve and grow more complex, and lack harmonization globally. The Safety Act further requires that if we or NHTSA determine a vehicle or an item of vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard, or that vehicle or equipment contains a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk, we must conduct a safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicles. Should we or NHTSA determine a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.\n\nOther National Requirements Outside of the U.S., many countries have established vehicle safety standards and regulations and are likely to adopt additional, more stringent requirements in the future. The European General Safety Regulation has introduced United  Nations  Economic  Commission  for  Europe  (UN-ECE)  regulations,  which  are  required  for  the  European  Type Approval process.  Globally,  governments  generally  have  been  adopting  UN-ECE  based  regulations  with  some  variations  to  address  local concerns.  Any  difference  between  North  American  and  UN-ECE  based  regulations  can  add  complexity  and  costs  to  vehicle development, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce complexity. New safety and recall requirements in various countries around the world, including in China, Brazil, and Gulf Cooperation Council countries, also may add substantial costs  and  complexity  to  our  safety  and  field  action  activities  globally.  In  Canada,  vehicle  regulatory  requirements  are  currently aligned  with  U.S.  regulations;  however,  under  the  Canadian  Motor  Vehicle  Safety  Act,  recall  thresholds  are  different  and  the Minister of Transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or non-compliance when the Minister considers it to be in the interest of safety. Further, various governments are beginning to mandate e-Call and other features that can be market-specific and add complexity and increase our cost of compliance globally.\n\nCrash Test Ratings and New Car Assessment Programs Organizations in various regions around the world, including in the U.S., rate and compare motor vehicles through various New Car Assessment Programs (NCAPs) to provide consumers and businesses with additional information about the safety of new vehicles. NCAPs use crash tests and other evaluations that are different than what is required by applicable regulations, and use stars to rate vehicle safety, with five stars awarded for the highest rating and one for the lowest. Achieving high NCAP ratings, which can vary by country and region, can add complexity and cost to vehicles.\n\nWebsite Access to Our Reports Our internet website address is https://www.gm.com.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Competition\n\nOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, virtual assistants, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure, tools and services relating to artificial intelligence, and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, communications, and other electronic devices and services; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats; and (10) providers of virtual or inperson healthcare services. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers' ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth's most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 1,556,000 fulltime and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for personnel across other parts of our business.\n\nWe strive to be Earth's best employer. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement this objective and invent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (education funding for eligible employees). Over 240,000 Amazon employees around the world have participated in Career Choice. We also continue to inspect and refine the mechanisms we use to hire, develop, evaluate, and retain our employees. In addition, safety is integral to everything we do at Amazon and we continue to invest in safety improvements such as capital improvements, new safety technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineering ergonomic solutions. Our safety team is dedicated to using the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.",

Additionally, there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers, who are necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. If we are unable to recruit, retain, and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in the availability and cost of labor could adversely affect our business.\n\nOur business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs, both domestically and internationally. Such increases could be triggered by state and federal legislation and regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling, and benefits; increases in healthcare and workers' compensation insurance costs; and increases in wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high-quality employees with the right skill sets. For ex ample, at the federal level, effective July 1, 2024, the United States Department of Labor increased the minimum salary threshold requirements for employees who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act overtime requirements, and at the state level, Assembly Bill 1228 increased minimum wage and established working hour and working condition standards for certain partners in California. These changes, along with others that may occur in the future, could have a significant impact on the classification of employees as being exempt from overtime and add to our labor costs. The growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of employees, to maintain an effective system of operational internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise, and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience; the failure to do so could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, a shortage of labor for store positions, and the increased availability of alternative telecommuting employment options by other employers could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for other key functions. In addition, our wages and benefits programs may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent.\n\nStarting in September 2021, Starbucks partners at a number of company-operated stores sought union representation through elections conducted by the National Labor Relations Board. Unions have secured representation rights at hundreds of our more than 10,000 U.S. company-operated stores, with potentially more to follow, and Starbucks is engaged in collective bargaining for initial collective bargaining agreements for these stores. If we encounter difficulties negotiating collective bargaining agreements, are unsuccessful in those efforts, or obtain contracts with unfavorable terms, then we could incur additional costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility, and increase our operational complexity. These risks could also present the potential to disrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully implement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business needs.\n\nThe law places limitations on unilateral actions taken with respect to employees who are represented by unions because, in certain circumstances, the law requires the employer to notify and to bargain with the union prior to making certain operational or other changes that may affect employee wages, hours, or other terms and conditions of employment. Moreover, where a petition for representation has been filed by a union, the employer is also constrained from making changes in wages, hours, and working conditions. These limitations could also negatively affect our costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility, and increase our operational complexity. They also present the potential to disrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully implement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business needs.\n\nMoreover, we have experienced job actions in some company-operated stores. Such job actions and work stoppages have the potential to negatively impact our operations, third-party providers upon whom we rely to deliver product, our sales and customer flow in impacted locations, our costs, and can also have a negative impact on our reputation and brand.\n\nAdditionally, our position with respect to unions and the unionization of partners could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and could have material adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results. These positions could also expose us to legal risk, causing us to incur costs to defend legal and regulatory actions, potential penalties and restrictions, and reputational harm.\n\n## Risks Related to Competition\n\n## We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.\n\nThe specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience (such as delivery service and mobile ordering), and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all of these areas in each of our channels and markets. Accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. In the U.S., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to Starbucks stores and/or average value per transaction, adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. Similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors, or \u00ae",

Starbucks maintains 83.2 million shares available for future equity awards, including stock appreciation rights, under its incentive plans.

Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, while decreasing our environmental impact.\n\nIn addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, digital technologies, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, physicians and other experts who consult with us and review certain designs, materials and concepts for product and manufacturing, design and other process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process.\n\nAs we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products and experiences incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories and consumer applications. Using market intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories to respond to consumer preferences. The proliferation of Nike Air, Zoom, Nike Free, Flywire, Dri-Fit, Flyknit, FlyEase, ZoomX, Air Max, Nike React and Nike Adapt technologies, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products.\n\n## MANUFACTURING\n\nVirtually all of our footwear and apparel products are manufactured outside the United States by independent manufacturers with whom we contract and refer to as 'contract manufacturers.' Many of these contract manufacturers operate multiple finished goods contract factories. We are also supplied, primarily indirectly, by a number of materials, or 'Tier 2,' suppliers, who provide the principal materials used in footwear and apparel finished goods products. As of May 31, 2022, we had 139 strategic Tier 2 suppliers.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 3",

In contrast, LOW acknowledges that the indentures governing its notes include various restrictive covenants, although it asserts that these covenants are not expected to impact liquidity or capital resources. NKE highlights the potential for restrictive covenants in its debt structure to reduce financial flexibility, particularly in scenarios involving credit rating changes or macroeconomic volatility. Synthesizing these perspectives, HD avoids restrictive covenants entirely in its leasing arrangements, LOW accepts them as a standard part of debt instruments without expecting material impact, and NKE emphasizes the risk such covenants pose to its broader financial strategy under stress conditions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nlease term used to calculate the right-of-use asset and lease liability at commencement includes the impacts of options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. When determining whether it is reasonably certain that we will exercise an option at commencement, we consider various existing economic factors, including market conditions, real estate strategies, the nature, length, and terms of the agreement, as well as the uncertainty of the condition of leased equipment at the end of the lease term. Based on these determinations, we generally conclude that the exercise of renewal options would not be reasonably certain in determining the lease term at commencement.\n\nThe discount rate used to calculate the present value of lease payments is the rate implicit in the lease, when readily determinable. As the rate implicit in the lease is rarely readily determinable, we use a secured incremental borrowing rate, which is updated on a quarterly basis, as the discount rate for the present value of lease payments.\n\nReal estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, and operating expenses applicable to the leased property are generally our obligations under our lease agreements. In instances where these payments are fixed, they are included in the measurement of our lease liabilities, and when variable, are excluded and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Certain of our lease agreements also include rental payments based on an index or rate and others include rental payments based on a percentage of sales. For variable payments dependent upon an index or rate, we apply the active index or rate as of the lease commencement date. Variable lease payments not based on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of our lease liabilities as they cannot be reasonably estimated, and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\n\nLeases that have a term of twelve months or less upon commencement are considered short-term in nature. Short-term leases are not included on the consolidated balance sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have also elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for certain classes of assets including real estate and certain equipment.\n\nOur lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill, but assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. Each fiscal year, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments, with a quantitative assessment completed periodically as facts and circumstances warrant. We completed our last quantitative assessment in fiscal 2019 and concluded that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values, including goodwill.\n\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for our U.S., Canada, and Mexico reporting units based on qualitative factors. We performed a qualitative assessment to determine if there were any indicators of impairment and concluded that while there have been events and circumstances in the macro-environment that have impacted us, we have not experienced any entity-specific indicators that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units were less than their carrying amounts. There were no impairment charges related to goodwill for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, or fiscal 2019.",

The indentures also contain a provision that allows the holders of the notes to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of their notes if a change of control triggering event occurs. If elected under the change of control provisions, the repurchase of the notes will occur at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, if any, on such notes up to the date of purchase. The indentures governing the notes do not limit the aggregate principal amount of debt securities that the Company may issue and do not require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios or levels of net worth or liquidity. However, the indentures include various restrictive covenants, none of which is expected to impact the Company's liquidity or capital resources.\n\nThe discounts associated with these issuances, which include the underwriting and issuance discounts, are recorded in long-term debt and are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes using the effective interest method.\n\nDuring 2020, the Company completed cash tender offers to purchase and retire $3.0 billion combined aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes with a weighted average interest rate of 4.80%. As a result of the 2020 cash tender offers, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.1 billion which includes premium paid to holders of the debt, unamortized deferred financing fees and original issue discounts, and loss on reverse treasury lock derivative contracts.

We require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental, human rights, health and safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require our contract manufacturers and the contractors of our licensees to comply with applicable standards for product safety. Notwithstanding their contractual obligations, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors. If one or more of our direct or indirect contractors violates or fails to comply with, or is accused of violating or failing to comply with, such standards and laws, this could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged unethical or illegal practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales, force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licenses or result in the imposition of additional regulations, including new or additional quotas, tariffs, sanctions, product safety regulations or other regulatory measures, by governmental authorities.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Securities, Investments and Liquidity\n\n## Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns.\n\nFrom time to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses or capabilities, product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses, such as our NIKE Direct operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost-effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability; however, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business. The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. See also ' Our NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties .'\n\n## The sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022, Swoosh, LLC beneficially owned approximately 77% of our Class A Common Stock. If, on June 30, 2022, all of these shares were converted into Class B Common Stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 16%. The shares are available for resale, subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H. Knight, our Chairman Emeritus, to hold the majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock. Mr. Knight does not have voting rights with respect to Swoosh, LLC, although Travis Knight, his son and a NIKE director, has a significant role in the management of the Class A Common Stock owned by Swoosh, LLC.\n\n## Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options.\n\nOur long-term debt is currently rated Investment Grade by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for our existing facilities or for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to credit or capital markets, could be adversely affected. We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default, and as a result, the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt.\n\n## If our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results could be adversely affected.\n\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 22",

These factors, together with growing competition among potential employers, may result in increased salaries, benefits, or other employee-related costs, or may impair our ability to recruit and retain associates, which could have an adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, in order to execute our interconnected retail strategy, including our supply chain investments, we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals, including technology professionals, to implement our ongoing technology and other investments. The market for these professionals is increasingly competitive. An inability to provide wages and/or benefits, including remote or hybrid work flexibility, that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract associates. Further, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our labor costs.\n\nAdditionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including management transitions within the Company's senior leadership, and to effectively motivate and retain associates is critical to our business success. If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified associates, or manage leadership transition successfully, our ability to effectively manage our strategy may be negatively impacted, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease, and our financial performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## A failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business.\n\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems and related personnel to collect, analyze, process, store, manage, transmit, and protect transactions and data. Some of these systems are managed or provided by third-party service providers, including certain cloud platform providers. In managing our business, we also rely heavily on the integrity of, security of, and consistent access to, this operational and financial data for information such as sales, customer data, associate data, demand forecasting, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment, supply chain management, payment processing, order fulfillment, customer service, and post-purchase matters. For these information technology systems, applications, and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must maintain and update them. Delays in the maintenance, updates, upgrading, or patching of these systems, applications or processes could impair, and on occasion have impaired, their effectiveness or expose us to security risks. Our systems and the third-party systems with which we interact are subject to and on occasion have experienced damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power and other critical infrastructure outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; security breaches; internal or external data theft or misuse; cyberattacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, spyware, denial of service attacks, and ransomware; responsive containment measures by us that may involve voluntarily taking systems off line; natural disasters and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, or other extreme weather events; public health concerns, such as pandemics and quarantines; military conflicts, acts of war, terrorism or civil unrest; other systems outages; inadequate or ineffective redundancy; and design or usage errors or malfeasance by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers. Although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, such efforts are not always successful. As a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations or impair data security; impact our ability to operate or access communications, financial or banking systems; be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy; and adversely impact our reputation and relationship with customers, suppliers, shareholders or regulators.\n\nIn addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems, infrastructure and personnel, in certain cases with the assistance of strategic partners and other third-party service providers. These investments involve replacing existing systems, some of which are older, legacy systems that are less flexible and efficient, with successor systems; outsourcing certain technology and business processes to third-party service providers; making changes to existing systems, including the migration of applications to the cloud; maintaining or enhancing legacy systems that are not currently being replaced; or designing or costeffectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. These efforts can result in significant potential risks, including failure of the systems to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data, changes in security processes and internal controls, cost overruns, implementation delays or errors, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements.

The principal competitive factors in our industry include convenience, customer service and experience, quality and price of merchandise and services, in-stock levels, and merchandise assortment and presentation. We face growing competition from online and omnichannel retailers who have a similar product or service offering. Customers are increasingly able to quickly comparison shop and determine real-time product availability and price using digital tools. Further, online and omnichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, as customers are increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times, including same-day and next-day fulfillment, low-price or free shipping, and convenient pick-up options, including curbside pickup, in-store pick-up, and buy online pick-up in-store (BOPIS) lockers, and we must make investments to keep up with our customers' evolving shopping preferences. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times, delivery costs, and delivery options depends on many factors, including successful implementation and the continued maintenance of our initiatives related to supply chain transformation, including our market-based delivery model. Our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance. Moreover, changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors, including the effects of competitor liquidation activities, may impact our results.\n\nIf we fail to hire, train, manage, and retain qualified associates with expanded skill sets or corporate support staff with the capabilities of delivering on strategic objectives, we could lose sales to our competitors, and our labor costs, resulting from operations or the execution of corporate strategies, could be negatively affected.\n\nOur customers, whether they are homeowners, renters or commercial businesses, expect our associates to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide. We compete with other retailers for many of our associates, and we are experiencing an unusually competitive labor market. Wages are increasing across the United States, and competitors are offering higher compensation than before, due to labor market conditions. Many associates are in entrylevel or part-time roles with historically high turnover rates, which has led to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market. Increasingly, our sales associates must have expanded skill sets, including, in some instances, the ability to do in-home or telephone sales. We need to attract and retain a diverse workforce that can deliver relevant, culturally competent and differentiated experiences for a wide variety of culturally diverse customers. Additionally, in order to deliver on the omnichannel expectations of our customers, we rely on the specialized training and capabilities of corporate support staff, which are broadly sought after by our competitors. Further, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including management transitions within the Company's senior leadership are critical to our business success. If we are unable to hire, train, manage, and retain qualified associates and specialists, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our results of operations could be negatively affected.\n\nFurthermore, our ability to meet our labor needs, particularly in a competitive labor market, while controlling our costs is subject to a variety of external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the availability of and competition for talent, health care and other benefit costs, our brand image and reputation, changing demographics and the adoption of new or revised legislation or regulations governing immigration, employment, labor relations, minimum wage, and health care benefits. Periodically, we are subject to labor organizing efforts, and if we become subject to collective bargaining agreements in the future, it could affect how we operate our business and adversely affect our labor costs. In addition to our United States and Canada operations, we have support offices in India and China, and any extended disruption of our operations in our different locations, whether due to labor difficulties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nPositively and effectively managing our public image and reputation is critical to our business success, and, if our public image and reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers, vendors, and associates and, consequently, our business and results of operations.\n\nOur public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customers shop at Lowe's, our vendors want to do business with Lowe's, and our associates want to work for Lowe's. We must continue to manage, preserve and grow Lowe's public image and reputation. Lowe's actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation. In addition, failure to meet our stated environmental and social goals, and consumer and investor concerns about our environmental and social practices are potential sources of reputational risk. In addition, vendors and others with whom we do business may affect our reputation. Any negative incident can erode trust and confidence quickly, and adverse publicity about us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers' confidence, reduce demand for our products and services, affect our relationships with current and future vendors, impact our results of operations, affect our ability to recruit, retain, and engage our associates, and attract regulatory scrutiny. The significant expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incidents.",

Decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health emergency, persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or there may be a general downturn in the restaurant industry. These and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, profitability or development plans, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n- Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\n\nFailure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to our operational and financial results, and expectations regarding the success of our Reinvention Plan and related guidance, environmental performance and shareholder returns, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. In addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance.\n\n## Risks Related to COVID-19\n\n- Our financial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is continuing to have, a significant impact on our business and results of operations. At the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, many of our company-operated and licensed stores were closed. For stores that remained open, same-store sales declined due to modified operating hours and reduced customer traffic. While nearly all of our company-operated and licensed stores have reopened, we expect that certain parts of our operations will continue to be impacted by the continuing effects of COVID-19, including resurgences and variants of the virus. Our China market experienced unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions in multiple cities that severely impacted customer mobility. It remains difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the broader economy and how consumer behavior may change, and whether such change is temporary or permanent. Social distancing, telecommuting and reductions in travel may become the new normal. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has required and may continue to require us to make controversial decisions about precautionary measures, such as vaccinations, showing proof of vaccinations and face coverings, that could impact our results, including by impacting our brand, our employee retention and satisfaction and the willingness of customers to buy our products. All of these conditions could fundamentally impact the way we work and the services we provide, and could have continuing adverse effects on our financial performance. As a result, we may incur additional impairment charges to our inventory, store and corporate assets-and our ability to realize the benefits from deferred tax assets may become limited-any of which may have a significant or material impact on our financial results.\n\nProlonged volatility or significant disruption of global financial markets due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources, on acceptable terms or at all and impede our ability to comply with debt covenants.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\nIf our business partners and third-party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, it could damage our brand and our financial results could suffer.\n\nOur global business strategy, including our plans for new stores, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, particularly for our entire global Channel Development business. Licensees, retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage and other products directly to customers. We believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or company-operated store, so we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these licensees and other business partners. However, the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial constraints, adherence to sanitation protocols and guidance (including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic), labor shortages and other factors. We do not have direct control over our business partners and may not have visibility into their practices.",

W e are focused on building a talent pipeline that reflects our consum ers, athletes and the com m unities we serve.\n\n## CULTURE\n\nEach em ployee shapes N IKE 's culture through behaviors and practices. This starts with our M axim s, which represent our core values and, along with our C ode of C onduct, feature the fundam ental behaviors that help anchor, inform  and guide us and apply to all em ployees. O ur m ission is to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world, which includes the belief that if you have a body, you are an athlete. W e aim  to do this by creating groundbreaking sport innovations, m aking our products m ore sustainably, building a creative and diverse global team , supporting the well-being of our em ployees and m aking a positive im pact in com m unities where we live and work. O ur m ission is aligned with our deep com m itm ent to m aintaining an environm ent where all N IKE  em ployees have the opportunity to reach their full potential, to connect to our brands and to shape our workplace culture.

These tools provide em ployees throughout the globe an opportunity to provide confidential feedback on key areas known to drive em ployee engagem ent, including their satisfaction with their m anagers, their work and the C om pany generally. T hese tools also m easure our em ployees' connection to N IKE 's culture. N IKE  also provides m ultiple points of contact for em ployees to speak up if they experience som ething that does not align with our values or otherwise violates our workplace policies, even if they are uncertain what they observed or heard is a violation of com pany policy.\n\nAs part of our com m itm ent to m aking a positive im pact on our com m unities, we m aintain a goal of investing 2% of our prior fiscal year's pre-tax incom e into global com m unities.

These factors and others have also made, and may continue to make, it more difficult to maintain an effective system of operational internal controls for a dispersed workforce, and to train partners to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience. Additionally, there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers, who are necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. If we are unable to recruit, retain, and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in the availability and cost of labor could adversely affect our business.\n\nOur business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs, both domestically and internationally. Such increases could be triggered by state and federal legislation and regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling, and benefits; increases in healthcare and workers' compensation insurance costs; and increases in wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high-quality employees with the right skill sets. For ex ample, at the federal level, effective July 1, 2024, the United States Department of Labor increased the minimum salary threshold requirements for employees who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act overtime requirements, and at the state level, Assembly Bill 1228 increased minimum wage and established working hour and working condition standards for certain partners in California. These changes, along with others that may occur in the future, could have a significant impact on the classification of employees as being exempt from overtime and add to our labor costs. The growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of employees, to maintain an effective system of operational internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise, and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience; the failure to do so could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, a shortage of labor for store positions, and the increased availability of alternative telecommuting employment options by other employers could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for other key functions. In addition, our wages and benefits programs may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent.\n\nStarting in September 2021, Starbucks partners at a number of company-operated stores sought union representation through elections conducted by the National Labor Relations Board. Unions have secured representation rights at hundreds of our more than 10,000 U.S. company-operated stores, with potentially more to follow, and Starbucks is engaged in collective bargaining for initial collective bargaining agreements for these stores. If we encounter difficulties negotiating collective bargaining agreements, are unsuccessful in those efforts, or obtain contracts with unfavorable terms, then we could incur additional costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility, and increase our operational complexity. These risks could also present the potential to disrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully implement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business needs.\n\nThe law places limitations on unilateral actions taken with respect to employees who are represented by unions because, in certain circumstances, the law requires the employer to notify and to bargain with the union prior to making certain operational or other changes that may affect employee wages, hours, or other terms and conditions of employment. Moreover, where a petition for representation has been filed by a union, the employer is also constrained from making changes in wages, hours, and working conditions. These limitations could also negatively affect our costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility, and increase our operational complexity. They also present the potential to disrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully implement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business needs.\n\nMoreover, we have experienced job actions in some company-operated stores. Such job actions and work stoppages have the potential to negatively impact our operations, third-party providers upon whom we rely to deliver product, our sales and customer flow in impacted locations, our costs, and can also have a negative impact on our reputation and brand.\n\nAdditionally, our position with respect to unions and the unionization of partners could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and could have material adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results. These positions could also expose us to legal risk, causing us to incur costs to defend legal and regulatory actions, potential penalties and restrictions, and reputational harm.\n\n## Risks Related to Competition\n\n## We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.\n\nThe specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience (such as delivery service and mobile ordering), and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all of these areas in each of our channels and markets. Accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. In the U.S., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to Starbucks stores and/or average value per transaction, adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. Similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors, or \u00ae",

      "question": "How do Amazon, The Home Depot, and Tesla each approach the protection of intellectual property, and what does this reveal about their distinct strategies for competitive differentiation in their core markets?",
      "answer": "Amazon emphasizes a comprehensive approach to intellectual property, including trademarks, copyrights, patents, and trade secrets, viewing them as critical to its success in e-commerce and technology. The company actively registers U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights, and files patent applications covering proprietary technology. This reflects a strategy focused on maintaining dominance in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving digital marketplace. In contrast, The Home Depot highlights its trademark portfolio, particularly its proprietary brands like Husky and Hampton Bay, and also applies for copyrights and patents, but with a focus on merchandising innovation and private label expansion. This suggests a strategy centered on brand recognition and product differentiation in the home improvement retail sector. Tesla, while also protecting IP, places a stronger emphasis on patents, particularly in electric vehicle and autonomous driving technologies, and has made a public pledge not to sue in good faith for patent infringement in the EV space. This reflects a strategy of fostering broader industry adoption of electric vehicles to grow the overall market, rather than strict enforcement of IP for competitive advantage. Together, these approaches reveal that Amazon prioritizes broad IP protection to maintain its market leadership, The Home Depot leverages IP to enhance product exclusivity and brand loyalty, and Tesla uses a more open IP philosophy to drive ecosystem growth and innovation leadership.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Competition\n\nOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including onpremises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers' ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth's most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,608,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for personnel across other parts of our business.\n\nAs we strive to be Earth's best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and develop the best talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (funded education for hourly employees) and the Amazon Technical Academy (software development engineer training). We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nTo complement our merchandising efforts, we offer a number of services for our customers, including installation services for our DIY and DIFM customers, as noted above. We also provide tool and equipment rentals at over 1,400 locations across the U.S. and Canada, providing value and convenience for both Pros and consumers. To improve the customer experience and continue to grow this differentiated service offering, we are continuing to invest in more locations, more tools, and better technology.\n\nSourcing and Quality Assurance. We maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innovative products directly from manufacturers in the U.S. and around the world. During fiscal 2021, in addition to our U.S. sourcing operations, we maintained sourcing offices in Mexico, Canada, China, India, Vietnam and Europe. To ensure that suppliers adhere to our high standards of social and environmental responsibility, we also have a global responsible sourcing program. Under our supplier contracts, our suppliers are obligated to ensure that their products comply with applicable international, federal, state and local laws. These contracts also require compliance with our responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, health and safety, environment, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. To drive accountability with our suppliers, our standard supplier buying agreement includes a factory audit right related to these standards, and we conduct factory audits and compliance visits with our suppliers of private branded and direct import products. Our 2021 Responsible Sourcing Report, available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility/sourcing-responsibility, provides more information about this program. In addition, we have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to establishing criteria and overseeing compliance with safety, quality and performance standards for our private branded products.\n\nIntellectual Property. Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, ecommerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business, including our proprietary brands such as HDX , Husky , Hampton Bay , Home Decorators Collection , Glacier Bay , Vigoro , Everbilt and Lifeproof . The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nWe also maintain patent portfolios relating to our business operations, retail services and products and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our business. Patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential to our business. We continuously assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within The Home Depot's portfolio of proprietary and exclusive brands.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nOur industry is highly competitive, very fragmented, and evolving. As a result, we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer bases, and service providers, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online. These competitors include a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO distributors, home d\u00e9cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. The internet facilitates competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the level of competition we face.\n\nWe compete primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, product availability and assortment, and delivery options, both in-store and online. We also compete based on store location and appearance, presentation of merchandise, and ease of shopping experience. Furthermore, with respect to delivery options, customers are increasingly seeking faster and/or guaranteed delivery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or convenient pickup options, including curbside pickup. Our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including the success of our supply chain investments, described more fully under 'Our Supply Chain' below.\n\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, and the lowest volume occurs either during our first or fourth fiscal quarter.",

          "chunk_text": "We believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology. For example, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3 and Model Y compete with small to medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs, which are extremely competitive markets. Competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers; however, many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions, including the introduction of electric vehicles into rental car company fleets, promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to the internal combustion vehicle. Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today in major markets including the U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions.\n\nWe also believe that there is increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering self-driving technologies, charging solutions and other features and services, and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our Autopilot, FSD and neural network capabilities, Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\n## Energy Storage Systems\n\nThe market for energy storage products is also highly competitive, and both established and emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems. We compete with these companies based on price, energy density and efficiency. We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage products give us a competitive advantage in our markets.\n\n## Solar Energy Systems\n\nThe primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers. We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio. As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other measures, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs within our products and technologies in the electric vehicle market as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other companies making electric vehicles and the world.\n\n## Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital Resources\n\n## ESG\n\nThe very purpose of Tesla's existence is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe the world cannot reduce carbon emissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption, and we are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation ecosystem to achieve this goal. As we expand, we are building each new factory to be more efficient and sustainably designed than the previous one, including with respect to waste reduction and water usage, and we are focused on reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain.\n\nWe are committed to only sourcing responsibly produced materials, and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that ensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, as well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing into their supply chains. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and we look to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and external stakeholders to find ways to continually improve. We are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement. As our production volumes increase, our incidents per vehicle continue to drop.",

      "answer": "HD structures its stock options with a typical vesting rate of 25% per year starting on the second anniversary of the grant, with a provision that a majority of stock options may become non-forfeitable when an associate reaches age 60 with five years of service. This indicates a retention mechanism for long-tenured employees. SBUX estimates the expected term of options based on historical experience of similar awards, factoring in vesting schedules and future employee behavior, which suggests a more behavior-driven and less prescriptive approach to vesting. TSLA, in contrast, has a highly structured 12-tranche vesting schedule for its 2018 CEO Performance Award, where each tranche vests only after both a market capitalization milestone (starting at $100 billion and increasing by $50 billion per tranche) and an operational performance metric are achieved. This reflects a strong alignment of executive compensation with both market and operational success. Synthesizing these approaches reveals a spectrum of equity compensation design\u2014from HD\u2019s tenure- and age-based retention focus, to SBUX\u2019s empirical modeling of vesting behavior, to TSLA\u2019s aggressive performance-linked vesting\u2014highlighting differing philosophies in incentivizing and retaining key talent.",

Under the terms of the Plans, incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options must have an exercise price at or above the fair market value of our stock on the date of the grant. Typically, nonqualified stock options vest at the rate of 25% per year commencing on the second anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary date of the grant. Additionally, a majority of our stock options may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service.

The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at $100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0 billion thereafter (based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been achieved for the four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial statements filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of the exercise price of $70.01 per share, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five years post-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding.\n\nThe achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2021 is provided below. Although an operational milestone is deemed achieved in the last quarter of the relevant annualized period, it may be certified only after the financial statements supporting its achievement have been filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K.\n\n",

Tesla specifically calls out GDPR\u2019s applicability to data collected from individuals in the EU and notes the significant risk of fines for noncompliance, particularly in relation to its vehicle and energy product data practices.

Similarly, such an occurrence could result in the compromise, acquisition or loss of the information processed by these systems and products. Such events could result in, among other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation. In addition, such events could increase the risk of claims alleging that we are non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subjecting us to potential liability from private  litigation  or  regulatory  penalties  and  related  costs  under  laws  protecting  the  privacy  of  personal  information  or  unfair  or  deceptive  practices  relating  to consumer information; disrupt our operations; or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies. V arious events described above have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Although impacts of past events have been immaterial, the impacts of such events in the future may be material.\n\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions of our in-vehicle systems could impact the safety of our customers and reduce confidence in GM and our products . Our vehicles  contain  complex  information  technology  systems.  These  systems  control  various  vehicle  functions  including  engine,  transmission,  safety,  steering, navigation,  acceleration,  braking,  window,  door  lock  functions  and  battery  and  electric  motors.  We  have  designed,  implemented  and  tested  security  measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to these systems. However, hackers and other malicious actors have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use networks, vehicle software or their systems to gain control of, or to change, our vehicles' functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle. Any unauthorized access to, or control of, our vehicles or their systems or any unauthorized access to, acquisition of or loss of data could adversely impact the safety of our customers or result in failure of our systems, any of which could result in interruptions to our business, legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties. Laws that would permit third-party access to vehicle data and related systems, including \"right to repair\" laws, could expose our vehicles and vehicle systems to third-party access without appropriate security measures in place, leading to new safety and security risks for our customers and reducing customer trust and confidence in our products. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles or their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our vehicles or their systems or data are capable of being \"hacked\" and lack appropriate safety controls, could negatively affect our brand and harm our reputation, which could adversely impact our business and operating results.\n\nOur enterprise data practices, including the collection, use,  sharing  and  security  of  the  personal  or  other  information  of  our  customers,  employees  and suppliers, are subject to increasingly complex and restrictive regulations in all key market regions . Data privacy and protection and unfair and deceptive practice laws and similar regulations in many jurisdictions where we do business require that we take significant steps to safeguard such personal information, and these laws and regulations continue to evolve. Under these regulations, which include, but are not limited to, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, the EU's G eneral Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, the U.K. Data Protection Act of 2018, and other international data protection, privacy, data security, data localization and similar national, state, provincial, and local laws, the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints, private litigation and regulatory inquiry resulting in civil or criminal penalties, as well as have a negative impact on our brand or result in other harm to our business.  In addition, increased consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failures in establishing, implementing and maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services.  The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be high and is likely to increase in the future. The growing patchwork of state and country regulations imposes burdensome obligations on companies to  quickly  respond  to  consumer  requests,  such  as  requests  to  delete,  disclose  and  stop  selling  personal  information,  with  significant  fines  for  noncompliance. Complying with these new laws has significantly increased, and may continue to increase, our operating costs and is driving increased complexity in our operations.\n\n## Risks related to government regulations and litigation\n\nOur operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business. We are significantly affected by governmental regulations on a global basis that can increase  costs  related  to  the  production  of  our  vehicles  and  affect  our  product  portfolio,  particularly  regulations  relating  to  fuel  economy  standards  and  G HG emissions. Meeting the requirements of these regulations is costly, often technologically challenging and may require phase-out of ICE vehicles in certain major jurisdictions, and these standards are often not harmonized across jurisdictions. We anticipate that the number and extent of these and other regulations, laws and policies, and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio, may increase significantly in the future, primarily motivated by efforts to reduce GHG  emissions. Specifically, fuel economy and GHG  emission regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to further limit the sale of certain profitable ICE products in current and future years, subsidize the sale of less profitable ones, change our manufacturing processes, pay increased penalties, purchase  additional  credits  from  our  competitors  or  undertake  other  activities  that  may  require  us  to  incur  additional  ex pense,  which  may  be  material.  These requirements may increase the cost of, and/or",

Further, statements about our ESG-related initiatives and goals, and progress toward those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. Previously reported data may in the future be adjusted to reflect improvements in the availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations, and other changes in circumstances. If our ESG-related data, processes, and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, our reputation, business, financial performance, and growth could be adversely affected. If we are unable to meet our ESG-related goals, commitments, initiatives, or evolving stakeholder or industry expectations and standards, if we change or are perceived to have changed our goals, commitments, or initiatives, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to stakeholder interests in ESG issues, customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor, and our reputation, business, or financial condition may be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, we could be criticized by shareholders, stakeholders, regulators, or other interested parties for the scope or nature of our ESG initiatives or goals or for any revisions to these goals. We have been and could continue to be subject to negative responses by governmental actors (such as anti-ESG legislation or retaliatory legislative treatment) or consumers (such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns) targeting Starbucks, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial performance, and growth.\n\n## Certain activist shareholder actions have caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur expense, hinder execution of our business strategy, and adversely impact our stock price.\n\nWe actively engage in discussions with our shareholders regarding further strengthening our Company and creating long-term shareholder value. This ongoing dialogue can include certain divisive activist tactics, which can take many forms. Some shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, has resulted in, and could in the future result in, substantial costs, such as legal fees and ex penses, and the diversion of management's and our Board's attention and resources from our businesses and strategic plans. Additionally, public shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with our customers, partners, licensees, or business partners, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. Activists or other shareholders holding a large portion of our outstanding shares will also have the ability to ex ert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, including the election of directors, the approval of mergers, acquisitions, and other significant business transactions, shareholder proposals, and amendments to our governing documents. These risks could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\n## Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation\n\n## Failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results.\n\nOur policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules, and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the SEC, Nasdaq, and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, food and beverage, sanitation, safety, environmental, labeling, anti-bribery and corruption, and merchandise laws. Such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations, which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of non-compliance. For example, changes in the enforcement priorities of regulators may also shift the impact of applicable regulations on the business and the costs necessary to ensure compliance therewith, including through an expansion in the nature, scope, or complexity of matters on which we are required to report. Changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, including expanded or additional regulations and associated costs to limit carbon diox ide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital ex penditures, incremental investments, and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. Other ex amples of emerging and potentially relevant requirements are import tariffs and restrictions grounded in, among other things, alleged human rights abuses.\n\nIn addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux, and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area. Current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, discussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable international and U.S. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies, or result in the possibility of fines, litigation, or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and",

New, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could also lead to increased costs of compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant, and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines. In addition, as we have increased our operations, we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government investigations, that we will need to defend against. If we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it may harm our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, business and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad. For example, in countries outside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different from equivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in all countries. This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements.\n\nIn particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation. We are continuing to develop our Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) technology. There are a variety of international, federal and state regulations that may apply to, and may adversely affect, the design and performance, sale, marketing, registration and operation of Autopilot and FSD (Supervised), and future capability, including autonomous vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. Such regulations, including their enforcement or the enforcement policy associated with the regulations, continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which could adversely affect our business.\n\nFinally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a supplier of electricity generated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a provider of grid services through virtual power plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning the import or export of components, electricity pricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-owned systems. If regulations and policies are introduced that adversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance or use of our solar and energy storage systems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and services, threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant jurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Any failure by us to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us.\n\nAny failure by us or our vendors or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or international privacy, data protection, artificial intelligence or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an unsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us. In addition, certain privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation, application and impact, and may require ex tensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union requiring certain data protection measures when handling, with a significant risk of fines for noncompliance. Similarly, our North American operations are subject to complex and changing federal and US state-specific data privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act which imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to California residents. Finally, additional privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in China, and other jurisdictions where Tesla has a market presence.\n\nThese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs and make enhancements to relevant data practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.",

      "question": "How do BKNG, LOW, and TSLA each classify and disclose their investments in Certificates of Deposit within their fair value hierarchies, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to short-term liquidity and risk management?",
      "answer": "BKNG reports $60 million in Certificates of Deposit classified as Level 1 within its fair value hierarchy, indicating direct market pricing. LOW discloses $42 million in Certificates of Deposit under Level 1 classification, showing a similar reliance on quoted market values for its short-term investments. TSLA, while not providing a specific dollar amount, confirms that its Certificates of Deposit are classified under Level II, indicating valuation based on market-based inputs but not direct quotes in active markets. This suggests BKNG and LOW treat CDs as highly liquid, market-priced instruments, while TSLA applies a more indirect valuation method, potentially reflecting a more conservative approach to liquidity risk assessment.",

NKE's equity awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, typically vest ratably over four years of continued employment.

      "question": "How do Home Depot, Lowe's, and Starbucks each articulate the impact of employee turnover on their business strategies, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to workforce stability in the consumer discretionary sector?",
      "answer": "Home Depot highlights that negative incidents or adverse publicity can erode trust and confidence quickly, impacting its ability to recruit, engage, motivate, and retain associates. Lowe\u2019s emphasizes that reputational damage could affect its relationships with vendors and associates, particularly due to broader social and environmental expectations and the challenges of maintaining a positive workplace environment. Starbucks directly links its success to the availability and retention of qualified personnel, noting that labor market challenges, including wage inflation and labor shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact its ability to attract and retain employees. Together, this reveals that while all three companies recognize the importance of workforce stability, Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s focus on reputational and cultural factors influencing turnover, whereas Starbucks emphasizes structural labor market challenges.",

BKNG, in contrast, does not intend to indefinitely reinvest its international earnings that are subject to U.S. taxation under the mandatory deemed repatriation or GILTI provisions. NKE changed its reinvestment assertion in fiscal 2022 due to a legal entity restructuring that reduced withholding tax consequences, and now no longer considers any foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested. These differences indicate that AMZN is most aggressive in deferring U.S. tax exposure, BKNG accepts some U.S. tax liability on foreign earnings, and NKE has recently shifted toward a more flexible reinvestment strategy.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\n\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.\n\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\n\nLevel 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\n\nLevel 2 - Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\n\nLevel 3 - Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\n\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\n\nWe hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, these warrants had a fair value of $3.0 billion and $3.4 billion, and are recorded within 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a writedown of inventory, was $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.",

The valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020 includes $18 million related to international operations and $40 million primarily related to U.S. research credits, capital loss carryforwards, and Connecticut NOLs.\n\nThe Company does not intend to indefinitely reinvest its international earnings that were subject to U.S. taxation pursuant to the mandatory deemed repatriation or subject to U.S. taxation as GILTI.\n\n## Reconciliation of U.S. Federal Statutory Income Tax Rate to Effective Income Tax Rate\n\nA significant portion of the Company's taxable earnings is generated in the Netherlands. According to Dutch corporate income tax law, income generated from qualifying innovative activities is taxed at a rate of 9% (\"Innovation Box Tax\") for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021 rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25%. Previously, the Innovation Box Tax rate was 7%. A portion of Booking.com's earnings during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 qualified for Innovation Box Tax treatment, which had a significant beneficial impact on the Company's effective tax rate for those years.",

The liability for payment of interest and penalties increased by $45 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, increased by $45 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, and decreased by $16 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. As of May 31, 2022 and 2021, accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $248 million and $203 million, respectively (excluding federal benefit) and included within Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nAs of May 31, 2022 and 2021, long-term income taxes payable were $535 million and $640 million, respectively, and were included within Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S., as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently under audit by the U.S. IRS for fiscal years 2017 through 2019. The Company has closed all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2016, with the exception of certain transfer pricing adjustments. Tax years after 2011 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in the aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $20 million within the next 12 months. In January 2019, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company. The Company believes the investigation is without merit. If this matter is adversely resolved, the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to prior periods, and the Company's income taxes related to prior periods in the Netherlands could increase.\n\nThe Company historically had not provided for deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as they were considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, in connection with a change in the Company's legal entity structure that reduced the withholding tax consequences of a decision to remit undistributed earnings in the Netherlands, the Company changed its assertion regarding its ability and intent to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company has evaluated its historic indefinite reinvestment assertion as a result of the legal entity restructuring and determined that any historical or future undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested. There is no deferred tax liability associated with those earnings.\n\nA portion of the Company's foreign operations benefit from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2031. This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The tax benefit attributable to this tax holiday, before taking into consideration other U.S. indirect tax provisions, was $221 million, $238 million and $238 million for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on diluted earnings per common share was $0.14, $0.15 and $0.15 for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nDeferred tax assets as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, were reduced by a valuation allowance. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, a valuation allowance was provided for U.S. capital loss carryforwards and on tax benefits generated by certain entities with operating losses. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, a valuation allowance was provided for U.S. capital loss carryforwards and on tax benefits generated by certain entities with operating losses. There was a $7 million net increase in the valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, compared to a $14 million net decrease for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, and $62 million net decrease for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020.\n\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax assets of $103 million as of May 31, 2022 for U.S. foreign tax credit carry-forwards which will begin to expire in 2032.\n\nThe Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of $44 million as of May 31, 2022. If not utilized, such losses will expire as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How do Amazon, Lowe's, and McDonald's each assess the materiality of government regulation on their international operations, supply chain dynamics, and commodity costs, and what does this indicate about their relative risk exposure?",
      "answer": "Amazon highlights significant exposure to government regulation in international markets, particularly in China and India, where restrictive foreign ownership and licensing requirements have necessitated complex operational structures. Lowe's explicitly states that compliance with government regulations will not have a material effect on its capital expenditures, operations, or competitive position. McDonald's notes that government regulation indirectly affects its business through impacts on commodity markets and financial systems, such as trade policies and capital flow regulations. This indicates that Amazon faces the highest regulatory risk due to its global footprint and market entry complexities, Lowe's experiences minimal regulatory disruption, and McDonald's encounters moderate, indirect risks through supply chain and commodity cost volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMZN \u2192 Government Regulation: Amazon details regulatory constraints in China and India that require special operational structures, indicating material risk in international expansion.",
        "Hop 2: LOW \u2192 Government Regulation: Lowe's explicitly states that government regulation will not materially affect its operations or competitive position, signaling low regulatory exposure.",
        "Hop 3: MCD \u2192 Government Regulation: McDonald's links regulation to commodity cost volatility and financial market dynamics, showing indirect but meaningful exposure to regulatory impacts on supply chain."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn addition, failure to optimize inventory management or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by increasing the distance products are shipped and reducing the number of units per shipment or delivery. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. For example, productivity across our fulfillment network is affected by regional labor market constraints, which increase payroll costs and make it difficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like.\n\nUnder some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to adequately predict seller demand for storage or to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.\n\nWe rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties ex perienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems, including as a result of labor market constraints and related costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or ex treme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events.\n\n## We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Incidents\n\nBecause we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, classified, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information, failure to prevent, detect, or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, or other security incidents or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors' or customers' technology, products, and systems, could: expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security incidents, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent, detect, or mitigate such incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security incident at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented.\n\n## We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy\n\nWe experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. Steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nOur computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures (including from energy shortages), and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.\n\n## The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business\n\nWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel, including our President and CEO. We do not have 'key person' life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate, as well as senior management, has historically been intense. For example, we experience",

In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China, Germany and any future sites such as Mexico. We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our product ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets.\n\nWe have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and Solar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future products, features and services based on artificial intelligence. Likewise, we may encounter delays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products. In addition, as we continue to develop our artificial intelligence services and products, we may face many additional challenges, including the availability and cost of energy, processing power limitations and the substantial power requirements for our data centers.\n\nAny delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of our future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Our suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, or we may be unable to manage these components effectively.\n\nOur products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers, which exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages. Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, including inflation of raw material costs, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics, trade and shipping disruptions, port congestions, cyberattacks and other factors beyond our or our suppliers' control could also affect these suppliers' ability to deliver technologies or components to us or to remain solvent and operational. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, or face other challenges such as insolvency, it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our production or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time. We have faced in the past, and may face suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, which may increase our costs or require us to replace them with other sources. Finally, as we construct new manufacturing facilities and add production lines to existing facilities, we may experience issues in correspondingly increasing the level of localized procurement at those facilities. While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce, especially in the case of increases in materials pricing. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\nAs the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which may harm our business and operating results.\n\n## We may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines, costs and production ramps at new factories, or we may experience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there.\n\nOur ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future factories.

          "chunk_text": "## LEASING\n\nThe Company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the Company leases the land and generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases the land and buildings). The Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability reflect the present value of the Company's estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using the rate implicit in each lease, if determinable, or a collateralized incremental borrowing rate considering the term of the lease and particular currency environment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, primarily related to leases of office equipment, are not included in the Lease right-or-use asset or Lease liability and continue to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Company has elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components in its lessee portfolio. To the extent that occupancy costs, such as site maintenance, are included in the asset and liability, the impact is immaterial and is generally limited to Company-owned and operated restaurant locations. For franchised locations, which represent the majority of the restaurant portfolio, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance are generally required to be paid by the franchisees as part of the franchise arrangement. In addition, the Company is the lessee under nonrestaurant related leases such as office buildings, vehicles and office equipment. These leases are not a material subset of the Company's lease portfolio.\n\n## CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE\n\nCapitalized software is stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which primarily ranges from 3 to 10 years. Customer facing software is typically amortized over a shorter useful life, while back office and Corporate systems may have a longer useful life. Capitalized software less accumulated amortization is recorded within M iscellaneous other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and was (in millions): 2024-$907; 2023-$836; 2022-$864.\n\nThe Company reviews capitalized software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable or if an indicator of impairment exists. Results for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflected the write-off of impaired software no longer in use of $72 million. The Company did not identify any indicators of material impairment of capitalized software for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022.\n\n## LONG-LIVED ASSETS\n\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing M cDonald's restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together in the U.S. at a field office lev el, and internationally , at a market lev el. The Company  manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurant's cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.\n\nLosses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Company's Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses are related to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered 'held for sale.\"\n\n## GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurants and other businesses, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual market) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of M cDonald's restaurants from franchisees or transactions in which the Company obtains a controlling interest in subsidiaries or affiliates. When purchasing restaurants from a franchisee, the Company generally uses a discounted cash flow methodology (Level 3 inputs within the valuation hierarchy), which determines the fair value of restaurants acquired based on their expected profitability and cash flows. During 2024, the Company acquired restaurants from franchisees (including 228 restaurants in Israel, which are presented within the International Developmental Licensed M arkets &amp; Corporate segment) in order to support key franchising initiatives. Total restaurant acquisitions for the year resulted in the Company recording approximately $150 million of net tangible assets, $270 million of identifiable intangible assets (primarily consisting of reacquired franchise rights) and $240 million of goodwill. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on the amount of recorded revenues or net income of the Company. If a Company-owned and operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a Company-owned and operated restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit.\n\nThe following table presents the 2024 activity in goodwill by segment:\n\n",

We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for ex pected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\n\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer's lender when we arrange the financing are recognized upfront as an offset against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are ex pensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n\nWe offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under these programs, we originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606.",

      "answer": "McDonald's emphasizes the importance of copyrights as part of its broader intellectual property portfolio, noting that it relies on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, and patents to protect its brand and branded products. The company acknowledges the challenges of protecting intellectual property globally, especially in rapidly evolving areas, and highlights the potential risks of infringement claims and the costs associated with enforcement. Nike, on the other hand, explicitly states that it owns copyright protection in its designs, graphics, software applications, and digital goods, and actively seeks registered copyrights when appropriate. The company views its intellectual property rights, including copyrights, as critical to its brand and competitive position, and has adopted a robust enforcement strategy globally. Tesla states that it seeks to protect its innovations through various intellectual property rights, including copyrights, and emphasizes its commitment to obtaining patents for broad protection. However, Tesla also highlights a unique open-access approach, pledging not to sue in good faith cases involving electric vehicle patents, aiming to accelerate industry-wide innovation. Together, these perspectives reveal distinct strategies: McDonald's focuses on defensive protection and brand consistency, Nike on aggressive enforcement and brand differentiation, and Tesla on open innovation to drive broader industry adoption.",

Starbucks emphasizes its exposure to beverage-related taxes and health guidelines, particularly in the context of public health emergencies and evolving consumer health awareness. Tesla notes that its business is shaped by automotive regulatory credits, clean energy incentives like those under the Inflation Reduction Act, and fluctuating raw material regulations. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies face regulatory pressures, the nature and impact of these regulations differ significantly\u2014ranging from food safety and real estate compliance for McDonald\u2019s, to health and beverage taxation for Starbucks, to clean energy and emissions-related policies for Tesla.",

          "chunk_text": "## Effective succession planning is important to our continued success.\n\nEffectiv e succession planning for management is important to our long-term success. Failure to effectively attract, recruit, develop, motivate and retain qualified key personnel, or to execute smooth personnel transitions, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results.\n\n## Food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.\n\nFood safety concerns have had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business. Our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our System's ability  to meet ex pectations for safe food and on our ability  to manage the potential impact on M cDonald's of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future, including in the supply chain, restaurants or delivery. Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources aimed at ensuring that our customers enjoy safe food products, including as our menu and service model evolve. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, have occurred within the food industry and our System from time to time (including the E. coli event in the U.S. in October 2024) and could occur in the future. Instances of food tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial results.\n\n## If we do not effectively manage our real estate portfolio, our operating results may be negatively impacted.\n\nWe have significant real estate operations, primarily in connection with our restaurant business. We generally own or secure a long-term lease on the land and building for conventional franchised and Company-owned and operated restaurant sites. We seek to identify and develop restaurant locations that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential. A s we generally secure long-term real estate interests for our restaurants, we have limited flex ibility  to quickly  alter our real estate portfolio. The competitiv e business landscape continues to ev olv e in light of changing business trends, consumer preferences, trade area demographics, consumer use of digital, delivery and drive thru, local competitive positions and other economic factors. If our restaurants are not located in desirable locations, or if we do not evolve in response to these factors, it could adversely affect Systemwide sales and profitability.\n\nOur real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate operations are also impacted by a variety of other factors, including governmental regulations, insurance, zoning, tax and eminent domain laws, interest rate levels, the cost of financing, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities, or other factors beyond our control. A  significant change in real estate values, or an increase in costs as a result of any of these factors, could adversely affect our operating results.\n\n## Information technology system failures or interruptions, or breaches of network security, may impact our operations or cause reputational harm.\n\nWe are increasingly reliant upon technology systems, such as point-of-sale, that support our business operations, including our digital and delivery solutions, and technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration with affiliated entities, customers, employees, franchisees, suppliers, service providers or other independent third parties to conduct our business, whether developed and maintained by us or provided by third parties. A ny failure or interruption of these systems could significantly impact our or our franchisees' operations, or our customers' experiences and perceptions. In addition, the artificial intelligence tools we are incorporating into certain aspects of our business may not generate the intended efficiencies and may impact our business results.\n\nSecurity incidents and breaches have from time to time occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the systems of the parties with whom we communicate or collaborate (including franchisees) or the systems of third-party providers. These may include such things as unauthorized access, phishing attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, computer viruses, deepfakes and other malicious uses of artificial intelligence, introduction of malware or ransomware, other disruptive problems caused by hackers or unintentional events. Certain of these technology systems contain personal, confidential, financial and other information of our customers, employees, franchisees and their employees, suppliers and other third parties, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. Despite response procedures and measures in place in the event an incident occurs, it could result in disruptions, shutdowns, or a security breach including the theft or unauthorized disclosure of certain of the above-described information. The actual or alleged occurrence of any of these types of incidents could result in mitigation costs, reputational damage, adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk, including administrative fines, criminal or civil penalties or civil liabilities.\n\nDespite the implementation of business continuity measures, any of these technology systems could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Certain technology systems may also become vulnerable, unreliable or inefficient in cases where technology vendors limit or terminate product support and/or maintenance. Our increasing reliance on third-party systems also subjects us to risks faced by those third-party businesses, including operational, security and credit risks. Further, the technology systems of third parties upon which we rely to conduct our business could be compromised in a manner that adversely affects us and our technology systems, information and business continuity. If technology systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, or if business continuity or disaster recovery plans were not effective, and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we could experience an interruption in our or our franchisees' operations. While we maintain insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\n## LEGAL AND REG ULATORY\n\n## Increasing regulatory and legal complexity may adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\nOur regulatory and legal environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways. M any of our markets are subject to increasing, conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations involving, among other matters, restaurant operations, product packaging, marketing, use of information technology systems, the nutritional and allergen content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices. Compliance efforts with those regulations may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers. We also are subject to increasing public focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, on environmental, social responsibility and corporate governance matters. Our success depends in part on our",

If we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives, or, in the event we undertake large acquisitions, integrations, and divestitures, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. In the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\n## Our investments to transform and enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected results.\n\nOur long-term business objectives depend on the successful execution of our strategies. We continue to build upon our investments in development, technology, digital engagement, and delivery in order to transform and enhance the customer experience. As part of these investments, we continue to focus on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, mobile order and payment systems, and enhancement of our technologies. We also continue to expand and refine our mobile ordering process. If these customer experience initiatives are not successfully executed or do not generate expected results, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our financial results may suffer. It is also possible that the greater allocation of time and resources to these customer experience initiatives versus other organizational priorities could negatively impact other areas of our business, or that we will fail to achieve optimal allocation of resources, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.\n\n## Evolving consumer preferences and tastes, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, may adversely affect our business.\n\nOur continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers. Our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outside-the-home food and beverages (such as a reduction in discretionary spending); lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the Starbucks brand), and platforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs, and our delivery services initiatives); or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced. In addition, some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar, and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. An unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether or not accurate, imposition of additional tax es on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and materially harm our business and results of operations. Changes in diet (whether due to changes in consumer behavior and eating habits, use of weight-loss drugs, or other factors) could also influence the demand for our offerings and materially harm our business and results of operations.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nAs is the case for some automotive companies, some of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. Where multiple sources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize potential production risks due to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times.\n\nOur products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these materials is governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and demand and market speculation. We strive to execute long-term supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible, and we currently believe that we have adequate access to raw materials supplies to meet the needs of our operations.\n\n## Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations\n\nGlobally, the ownership of our products by our customers is impacted by various government credits, incentives, and policies. Our business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.\n\nThe operation of our business is also impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\n\n## Programs and Incentives\n\n## Inflation Reduction Act\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ('IRA') was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022, and remains subject to future guidance releases. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax credits to consumers. For example, under current legislation, qualifying Tesla customers may receive up to $7,500 in federal tax  credits for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles in the U.S. through 2032.\n\n## Automotive Regulatory Credits\n\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles ('ZEVs'), greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Energy Storage System Incentives and Policies\n\nWhile the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.\n\nFor example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal tax credits described below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ('FERC') has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self G eneration Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs. In certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration. In such transactions, they are included as a component of energy generation and storage revenues in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nPursuant to the IRA, under Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the Internal Revenue Code ('IRC'), standalone energy storage technology is eligible for a tax credit between 6% and 50% of qualified expenditures, regardless of the source of energy, which may be claimed by our customers for storage systems they purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These tax credits are primarily for the benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.",

      "answer": "Lowe's structures its ESPP with a 15% discount on the closing price at purchase and treats the plan as a liability award, recognizing $21 million in share-based payment expense in 2023. Starbucks offers a 5% discount on the fair market value at the end of each quarterly offering period and issued 0.6 million shares under the ESPP in fiscal 2024. Tesla accounts for its ESPP using the fair value method, with the purchase period lasting six months and the cost recognized on a straight-line basis. These differences reflect varying degrees of financial commitment and strategic emphasis on ESPPs as a component of broader equity compensation programs.",

For a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except where we are expressly required to do so by law.\n\n## *  *  *  *  *  *  *\n\n## Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThe overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer with support from the Financial Risk Council, which reviews and, where appropriate, approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks. The Financial Risk Council comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the Audit Committee and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee and Finance Committee assist and guide the Board of Directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies. A risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies, risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the Financial Risk Council. Our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from large adverse market movements on our key exposures.\n\nAutomotive The following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and commodity risk. Sensitivity  analysis  is  used  to  measure  the  potential  loss  in  the  fair  value  of  financial  instruments  with  ex posure  to  market  risk.  The  models  used  assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in ex change rates, interest rate yield curves and commodity prices. For options and other instruments with nonlinear returns, models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of market shifts. There are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot ex change rates and commodity prices change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency exposures and offsetting long-short positions in currency or other exposures, such as interest rates and commodity prices, which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We have foreign currency exposures related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations. At December 31, 2024, our most significant foreign currency exposures were between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan,  Korean won,  Mexican peso and  Brazilian real.  Derivative  instruments  such  as  foreign  currency  forwards,  swaps  and  options  are  primarily  used  to  hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues, costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 12 months at December 31, 2024.\n\nThe net fair value liability of financial instruments with ex posure to foreign currency risk was $0.2 billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. These amounts are calculated utilizing a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and other assets. The potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been $0.3 billion and insignificant at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into U.S. dollars as part of the consolidation  process.  Fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  ex change  rates  can  therefore  create  volatility  in  the  results  of  operations  and  may  adversely  affect  our financial condition.",

During fiscal 2024, the Board and/or the Audit Committee receiv ed quarterly reports on priv acy, data protection and/or cybersecurity matters from senior information technology ('IT') leaders, including our Chief Information Officer ('CIO') and CISO, as well as the Chair of our Data Security and Priv acy Gov ernance Committee (discussed below). In addition, our Board held a meeting dedicated to cybersecurity topics. Periodically, our Board receiv es presentations on cybersecurity matters from third-party cybersecurity experts.\n\nOur CISO, who reports to our CIO, joined the Company in 2021 after working with the Company as a third-party consultant since 2019. During a nearly two-decade tenure at a leading professional serv ices firm, he worked with clients on managing information security, dev eloping cybersecurity strategy, and implementing effectiv e information and cybersecurity programs and initiativ es addressing emerging cybersecurity threats. Our CISO has significant prior cybersecurity experience, including experience protecting company, customer and associate data across a div erse set of industries. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Systems and has achiev ed sev eral relev ant certifications, including Certified Information Security Manager, Certified Information Systems Security Professional, and Certified Information Priv acy Professional. Our CISO leads a team of ov er 500 associates focused on cybersecurity.\n\nWe have three management-level committees that support our cybersecurity, priv acy and data gov ernance efforts. They are led by our Data Security and Priv acy Gov ernance Committee, which prov ides management-lev el gov ernance ov er cybersecurity matters, including discussion of cybersecurity priorities, emerging risks, awareness and training programs, risk mitigation efforts, and regulatory compliance. This committee is chaired by our Vice President - Internal Audit and Corporate Compliance and is composed of a cross-functional team of senior leaders, including our CEO. The committee generally meets quarterly and is supported by our Security and Technology Risk Leadership Committee and our Priv acy and Data Gov ernance Committee. The activ ities of the Data Security and Priv acy Gov ernance Committee are reported to the Board or the Audit Committee by the Chair of the committee, as appropriate.\n\nThe Security and Technology Risk Leadership Committee prov ides leadership and ov ersight of our cybersecurity program. It is chaired by our CISO and composed of Company technology leaders as well as a cross-functional group of representativ es from other departments. Our Priv acy and Data Governance Committee provides leadership and ov ersight of our priv acy and data gov ernance programs. It is chaired by our Chief Priv acy Officer and composed of a cross-functional group across approximately 20 departments. These committees generally meet monthly or ev ery other month and report to the Data Security and Priv acy Gov ernance Committee on a regular basis.\n\n## Item 2.

CYBERSECURITY\n\n## Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, ex tortion, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws.\n\nIdentifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity risks related to our business, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach including third party assessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews. To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we, among other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration testing using external third-party tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability reporting, conduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including our consumer products) and implement appropriate changes.\n\nWe have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected stages: 1) preparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and recovery, and 4) post-incident analysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity.\n\nSecurity events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents are evaluated to determine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact.\n\nWe also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals then collaborate with technical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form detection, mitigation and remediation strategies.\n\nAs part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and compliance with applicable practices and standards. As of 2024, our Information Security Management System has been certified to conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.\n\nOur risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third parties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service providers. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated when determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers and potential fourth-party risks when handling and/or processing our employee, business or customer data. In addition to new vendor onboarding, we perform risk management during third-party cybersecurity compromise incidents to identify and mitigate risks to us from third-party incidents.\n\nWe describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the heading 'Our information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences' included as part of our risk factor disclosures at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Cybersecurity Governance\n\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. Our Audit Committee is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. Members of the Audit Committee receive updates on a quarterly basis from senior management, including leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity. This includes existing and new cybersecurity risks, status on how management is addressing and/or mitigating those risks, cybersecurity and data privacy incidents (if any) and status on key information security initiatives. Our Board members also engage in ad hoc conversations with management on cybersecurity-related news events and discuss any updates to our cybersecurity risk management and strategy programs.",

As we continue to assess our performance throughout our regions, we may take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations, which may result in material asset write-downs or impairments and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. In addition, these restructuring actions subject us to increased risks of labor unrest or strikes, supplier, dealer, or other third-party litigation, regulator claims or proceedings, negative publicity  and  business  disruption.  Failure  to  realize  anticipated  savings  or  benefits  from  our  restructuring  and/or  cost  reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and cash flows.\n\n## Risks related to our intellectual property, cybersecurity, information technology and data management practices\n\nCompetitors  may  independently  develop  products  and  services  similar  to  ours,  and  there  are  no  guarantees  that  GM's intellectual  property  rights  would  prevent  competitors  from  independently  developing  or  selling  those  products  and  services. There may be instances where, notwithstanding our intellectual property position, competitive products or services may impact the value  of  our  brands  and  other  intangible  assets,  and  our  business  may  be  adversely  affected.  Moreover,  although  GM  takes reasonable  steps  to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of  GM  proprietary  information,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  such  efforts  will completely  deter  or  prevent  misappropriation  or  improper  use  of  our  intellectual  property.  We  sometimes  face  attempts  to  gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, we may be the target of patent enforcement actions by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. Although we have taken steps to mitigate such risks, if we are found to have infringed any third-party intellectual property rights, we could be required to  pay  substantial  damages,  or  we  could  be  enjoined  from  offering  some  of  our  products  and  services.  In  addition,  to  prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement, misappropriation or other violation  of  our  intellectual  property  against  third  parties. Any  such  action  could  result  in  significant  costs  and  diversion  of  our resources and management's attention, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any such action.\n\nSecurity  breaches  and  other  disruptions  to  information  technology  systems  and  networked  products,  including  connected vehicles,  owned  or  maintained  by  us,  GM  Financial,  or  third-parties,  such  as  vendors  or  suppliers,  could  interfere  with  our operations  and  could  compromise  the  confidentiality  of  private  customer  data  or  our  proprietary  information. We rely  upon information technology systems and manufacture networked and connected products, some of which are managed by third parties, to process,  transmit  and  store  electronic  information  and  to  manage  or  support  a  variety  of  our  business  processes,  activities  and products. Additionally, we and GM Financial collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary business information  (including  that  of  our  dealers  and  suppliers),  as  well  as  personally  identifiable  information  of  our  customers  and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks (including networks that may be controlled or maintained by third parties). The secure operation of these systems and products, and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these systems and products, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Further, customers using our systems rely on the security  of  our  infrastructure,  including  hardware  and  other  elements  provided  by  third  parties,  to  ensure  the  reliability  of  our products and the protection of their data. We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of  any  of  the  third  parties  that  facilitate  our  business  activities,  including  vendors,  service  providers,  suppliers,  customers, counterparties, exchanges, clearing agents, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties and other third parties who provide  us  services  or  with  whom  we  communicate  could  also  be  the  source  of  a  cyberattack  on,  or  breach  of,  our  operational systems, network, data or infrastructure. Despite our security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology systems  and  networked  and  connected  products  may  be  vulnerable  to  damage,  disruptions  or  shutdowns  caused  by  attacks  by hackers,  computer  viruses,  malware  (including  'ransomware'),  phishing  attacks  or  breaches  due  to  errors  or  malfeasance  by employees, contractors and others who have access to these systems and products. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise the confidentiality, operational integrity and accessibility of these systems and products and the data that resides within them.  Similarly,  such  an  occurrence  could  result  in  the  compromise  or  loss  of  the  information  processed  by  these  systems  and products.  Such  events  could  result  in,  among  other  things,  the  loss  of  proprietary  data,  interruptions  or  delays  in  our  business operations  and  damage  to  our  reputation.  In  addition,  such  events  could  increase  the  risk  of  claims  alleging  that  we  are  noncompliant with applicable laws or regulations, subjecting us to potential liability or regulatory penalties and related costs under laws protecting the privacy of personal information; disrupt our operations; or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies. Various events described above have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Although impacts of past events have been immaterial, the impacts of such events in the future may be material.\n\nSecurity  breaches  and  other  disruptions  of  our  in-vehicle  systems  could  impact  the  safety  of  our  customers  and  reduce confidence in GM and our products . Our vehicles contain complex information technology systems. These systems control various vehicle functions including engine, transmission, safety, steering, navigation, acceleration, braking, window, door lock functions and battery and electric motors.

We may not be able to prevent or even discover every instance of unauthorized third party uses of our intellectual property or dilution of our brand names, such as when a third party uses trademarks that are identical or similar to our own. If we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers, expose us to litigation and negatively impact our sales, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.\n\nProduct and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in Lowe's and our brand image. If our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety or quality, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks. Actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to litigation, as well as government enforcement action, and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. As a result, Lowe's reputation as a retailer of high-quality products and services, including both national and Lowe's private brands, could suffer and impact customer loyalty. Additionally, we and our customers have expectations on responsible sourcing. Under our Vendor Code of Conduct, our vendors are required to meet our expectations across multiple areas of compliance, including health and safety, environmental standards, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. If we need to seek alternative sources of supply from vendors with whom we have less familiarity, the risk of our standards not being met may increase.\n\n## Supply Chain and Third-Party Risks\n\nDisruptions in our international supply chain and our fulfillment network for our products due to factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, trade policy changes, and additional tariffs, have and continue to affect our results of operations.\n\nCircumstances surrounding and related to the COVID-19 pandemic have created unprecedented impacts on the global supply chain. We source, stock and sell products from domestic and international vendors, and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success. Impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic are placing strains on the domestic and international supply chain that have negatively affected the flow and availability of our products. This can and has resulted in higher out-of-stock inventory positions due to difficulties in timely obtaining products from the manufacturers and suppliers of our products. In addition, the costs of transportation of those products to our distribution centers and stores have increased while availability of transportation has decreased, which could negatively affect our business and financial results. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for such products, they may cost more, which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition.\n\nWe source a large number of our products from foreign manufacturers, with China being the dominant import source. Tax and trade policies, tariffs, and other regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries, especially China, enacted in recent years increased the cost of our merchandise sourced from outside of the U.S., which represents a large percentage of our overall merchandise. It remains unclear how tax or trade policies, tariffs, or trade relations may evolve in the future, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, effective income tax rate, liquidity, and net income. In addition, other countries may change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy and regulations already enacted or that may be enacted in the future. The degree of our exposure is dependent on, among other things, the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of tariffs. The impact to our business, including net sales and gross margin, will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nFinancial instability among key vendors, political instability and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain, changes in the total costs in our supply chain (including fuel and currency exchange rates), labor costs or labor shortages among our vendors, port labor disputes and security, the outbreak of pandemics, weather-related events, natural disasters, armed conflicts, work stoppages, shipping capacity restraints, changes in trade policy, retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the United States or a major source country, tariffs or duties, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and transport availability, capacity, and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs. In recent years, U.S. ports have been impacted by capacity constraints, port congestion and delays, periodic labor disputes, security issues, weather-related events, and natural disasters, which have been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements, our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging. If our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, we experience delays in inventory, increased delivery costs or merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence, and adversely affect our results of operations.",

Our international licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market. Our Channel Development business is heavily reliant on Nestl\u00e9, which has the right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. If Nestl\u00e9 fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect and grow our brand in Channel Development, our Channel Development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Additionally, the growth of our Channel Development business is in part dependent on the level of discretionary support provided by our retail and licensed store businesses.\n\nThere are generally a relatively small number of licensee partners operating in specific markets. If they are not able to access sufficient funds or financing, or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the markets. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our financial results have been and could continue in the future to be adversely affected by the disruption to the operations of our business partners, including licensee relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, through the effects of business and facilities closures, reductions in operating hours, social, economic, political or labor instability in affected areas, transportation delays, travel restrictions and changes in operating procedures, including for additional cleaning and safety protocols.\n\n- Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\n\nThe availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the 'C' price. This premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the 'C' coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base 'C' coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established.\n\nThe supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. For example, drought conditions in Brazil have and, given continued drought conditions, are predicted to continue to impact coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance.\n\nWe also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy, other commodities, including tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs and energy, as well as the processing of these inputs, are important to our operations. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Similarly, increases in the cost of, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in the processing of plant-based alternatives could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.\n\n- Interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability.\n\nAny material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants, interruptions in service by our third-party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, pandemics, social or labor unrest, labor shortages, natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability. Additionally, our food, beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly.

          "chunk_text": "across industry sectors for violations of the GDPR. The California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\"), which became operative in January 2020, and the California Privacy Rights Act, which is set to become operative in January 2023, each impose new privacy requirements and rights for consumers in California and has resulted and will continue to result in additional complexity and costs related to compliance. Many other jurisdictions have adopted or may adopt similar data protection regulations. These regulations are typically intended to protect the security of personal data that is collected, processed, and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction as well as to give individuals greater rights and/or control over how their data is processed. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information. These laws and their interpretations continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, the invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield in 2020 altered one of the acceptable approaches which many companies relied upon to ensure compliant data transfers between the European Union and the United States. Additionally, some of these regulations, such as the CCPA, give consumers a private right of action against companies for violations of these rules. While we have invested and continue to invest significant resources to comply with the GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations, many of these regulations (such as the Personal Information Protection Law in People's Republic of China (\"PRC\")) are new, complex, and subject to interpretation. Non-compliance with these laws could result in negative publicity, damage to our reputation, significant penalties, or other legal liability. If legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, our results of operations, financial condition, or competitive position could be adversely affected.\n\nCyberattacks and system vulnerabilities could lead to service outages, data loss, reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position.\n\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced rapid growth in consumer traffic to our online platforms, the number of accommodations on our extranets, and the geographic breadth of our operations. As the travel industry begins to recover, if our systems cannot be expanded to cope with increased demand or fail to perform, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times, decreased customer service and customer satisfaction, and delays in the introduction of new services, any of which could impair our reputation, damage our brands, and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Further, as an online business, we are dependent on the internet and maintaining connectivity between ourselves and consumers, sources of internet traffic, such as Google, and our travel service providers and restaurants. As consumers increasingly turn to mobile and other smart devices, we also become dependent on consumers' access to the internet through mobile carriers and their systems. Disruptions in internet access, especially if widespread or prolonged, could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. While we maintain redundant systems and hosting services, it is possible that we could experience an interruption in our business, and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur.\n\nWe have computer hardware for operating our services located in hosting facilities around the world. We do not have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every geographic region in which we conduct business, and these systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, computer viruses, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorism, and similar misconduct. In the event of any disruption of service at such facilities or the failure by such facilities to provide our required data communications capacity, we may not be able to switch to back-up systems immediately and it could result in lengthy interruptions or delays in our services. In addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff, these outages could create a significant amount of consumer questions and complaints that need to be addressed by customer support. Any system failure that causes an interruption or delay in service could impair our reputation, damage our brands, increase customer service costs, or result in lost business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We have taken and continue to take steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems. These steps are expensive, may reduce our margins, and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime.\n\nWe have experienced targeted and organized malware, phishing, and account takeover attacks, and may in the future experience these and other forms of attack such as ransomware, SQL injection (where a third party attempts to insert malicious code into our software through data entry fields in our websites in order to gain control of the system), and attempts to use our websites as a platform to launch a denial-of-service attack on another party. Our existing security measures may not be successful in preventing attacks on our systems. For instance, from time to time, we have experienced denial-of-service type attacks on our systems that have made portions of our websites slow or unavailable for periods of time. Traditional IT business continuity and disaster recovery practices are less effective against certain types of attacks such as ransomware or malware. A ransomware attack could result in our services being unavailable for an extended period of time, nullify our data, or expose our payment card and personal data. Reductions in the availability and response time of our online services could cause loss of substantial business volumes during the occurrence of any such attack on our systems and measures we may take to divert",

          "chunk_text": "Our inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our business operations and financial results.\n\nWe form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national and international brand names. We also have relationships with certain suppliers to enable us to sell proprietary products which differentiate us from other retailers. The inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results.\n\nFailure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell. We also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business. Many of these vendors and service providers have certain products or specialized skills needed to support our business concept and our strategies. If these vendors or service providers discontinue operations or are unable to perform as expected or if we fail to manage them properly or we are unable to replace them quickly, our business could be adversely affected, at least temporarily, until we are able to replace them.\n\nFailures relating to our third-party installer program or by our third-party installers could result in increased operational and legal risks and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe contract with third-party installers to provide installation services to our customers, and, as the general contractor, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, including certain licensing and permitting requirements, and those relating to the quality and performance of our third-party installers. Our or our third-party installers' failures to effectively manage such requirements and internal processes regarding installation services could result in lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, and may result in the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could negatively affect our business.\n\n## Technology and Cybersecurity Risks\n\nOur financial performance could be adversely affected if our information systems or the information systems of third-party vendors are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain, improve, upgrade and expand those systems.\n\nOur efforts to provide an omnichannel experience for our customers include investing in, maintaining and making ongoing improvements of our existing information systems that support operations, such as sales, inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering, project design and execution, transportation, receipt processing and fulfillment. We also engage third-party vendors for a variety of reasons, including for digital storage technology and content delivery. Such vendors may have access to information about our customers, associates, or vendors. Our systems and the systems of third-party vendors are subject to damage or interruption as a result of catastrophic events, power outages, viruses, malicious attacks and telecommunications failures, or other vulnerabilities and irregularities, and as a result we may incur significant expense, data loss, as well as, an erosion of customer confidence. Additionally, we continually make investments in our systems which may introduce disruption. Our financial performance could be adversely affected if our information systems are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain, improve, upgrade and expand those systems.\n\nAs customer-facing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our omnichannel sales and marketing strategy, the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences. Access to the Internet from computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them. Our websites, including Lowes.com, are a sales channel for our products, and are also a method of making product, project and other relevant information available to our customers that impacts our in-store sales. Additionally, we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire, inform, cross-sell, establish online communities among, and otherwise interact with our customers, including through online visualization and configuration tools. Performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems, including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service, ransomware, or other cyber-attacks, or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented, could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers' perceptions of Lowe's as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services.\n\nOur business and our reputation could be adversely affected by cybersecurity incidents and the failure to protect customer, employee, vendor, or Company information or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems, assets and such information.",

If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions.\n\n## Any unauthorized control or manipulation of our products' systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products.\n\nOur products contain complex information technology systems. For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality. While we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our products and their systems, malicious entities have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain control of, or to change, our products' functionality, user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products. We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting policy, and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability. However, there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can be identified, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful.\n\nAny unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or government investigations. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products, their systems or data are capable of being hacked, may harm our brand, prospects and operating results. We have been the subject of such reports in the past.\n\n## Our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities.\n\nIt is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as us to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies' operations. Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees, they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union signatory. From time to time, labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations, as part of which such unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board (the \"NLRB\"), and they may do so in the future. In September 2019, an administrative law judge issued a recommended decision for Tesla on certain issues and against us on certain others. In March 2021, the NLRB adopted a portion of the recommendation and overturned others. Tesla appealed the decision to the United States Circuit Court for the Fifth Circuit, which is currently pending. Any unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Tesla's treatment of our employees. Furthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as suppliers and trucking and freight companies. Any work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and may harm our business and operating results.\n\n## We may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions.\n\nAs a manufacturing company, we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products. Recalls for our vehicles have resulted from, for example, industry-wide issues with airbags from a particular supplier, concerns of corrosion in certain Model S and Model X power steering assist motor bolts, suspension failures in certain Model S and Model X, issues with certain Model S and Model X media control units and torqueing of bolts to internal specifications on certain Model 3 and Model Y, misalignment of the frunk latch assembly on certain Model S and unavailability of the rearview camera display on certain Model 3. In addition to recalls initiated by us for various causes, testing of or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that shows the actual safety risk to be non-existent. In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations, such as U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standards. Such recalls, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could result in significant expense, supply chain complications and service burdens, and may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims.\n\nWe provide a manufacturer's warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell. We also provide certain warranties with respect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell, including on their installation and maintenance. For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers' warranties, but may retain some warranty responsibilities for some or all of the life of such components. As part of our energy generation and storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that guarantee that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the contract. Under these performance guarantees, we generally bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls, even if they result from failures in components",

      "answer": "Home Depot disclosed that delivery delays on commodities like lumber exacerbated price volatility, directly affecting demand and profit margins. Lowe's similarly cited delivery delays for materials such as lumber and copper, which influenced demand and sales performance. Tesla specifically noted that delays in components and raw materials, including those tied to lithium-ion cells, led to increased costs and production challenges, impacting delivery timelines. These disclosures collectively show that while all three companies faced margin pressures from supply chain disruptions, Tesla's exposure to complex, high-tech components introduced additional operational risks compared to the more commodity-driven pressures faced by Home Depot and Lowe's.",

In addition, our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, which may adversely impact our sales and profitability.\n\n## The inflation or deflation of commodity and other prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins.\n\nPrices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, inflationary pressures, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, tariffs and trade restrictions, natural disasters, and periodic delays in delivery. In addition, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other geopolitical conflicts, as well as any related international response, may exacerbate inflationary pressures, including causing increases in commodity prices as well as fuel and other energy costs. Rapid and significant changes in commodity and other prices, such as changes in lumber prices, and our ability to pass them on to our customers or manage them through our portfolio strategy, may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins.\n\n## We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.\n\nWe are predominantly self-insured for a number of different risk categories, such as general liability (including product liability), workers' compensation, employee group medical, automobile claims, and network security and privacy liability, with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. The occurrence of significant claims, a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insurance, or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.\n\nGAAP and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as asset impairment, inventories, lease obligations, selfinsurance, vendor allowances, tax matters, business combinations, and litigation, are complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments, including due to uncertainty in the current environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. The implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems, internal process, internal controls, and other changes that could increase our operating costs.\n\nWe are involved in a number of legal, regulatory and governmental enforcement proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs.\n\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts or results. Additionally, involvement in these lawsuits, investigations and inquiries, and other proceedings, as well as compliance with any settlements or consent decrees that result from those proceedings, may involve significant expense, divert management's attention and resources from other matters, and impact the reputation of the Company.\n\n## Item 1B.

In addition, if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery laws, we could be subject to reputation and legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFuture litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements, negatively affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are, and in the future will become, involved in lawsuits, including consumer, commercial, employment, tort and other litigation, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. Some of these proceedings may raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and can be subject to uncertainties and complexities. The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes of, or resolutions to, these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments. Furthermore, defending against these proceedings may require a diversion of management's attention and resources.

Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices, such as changes in lumber prices, affect the demand for our products and our sales.\n\nTax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions.\n\nWe may be affected by higher rates of federal, state, or local tax imposed as a result of political developments or economic conditions, which could affect our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate and future tax liability could be adversely affected by regulatory and legal changes, the results of tax audits and examinations, and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters, all of which could negatively impact our business. In addition, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nLiquidity and access to capital rely on efficient, rational and open capital markets and are dependent on Lowe's credit strength. Our inability to access capital markets could negatively affect our business, financial performance and results of operations. We have relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund our working capital needs. Our access to these markets depends on our strong credit ratings, the overall condition of debt capital markets and our operating performance.

Such conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention, and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them effectively.\n\n## Our business may suffer if our products or features contain defects, fail to perform as expected or take longer than expected to become fully functional.\n\nIf our products contain design or manufacturing defects that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair, or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD features take longer than expected to become enabled, are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services may be harmed, and we may experience delivery delays, product recalls, product liability, breach of warranty and consumer protection claims and significant warranty and other expenses. For example, we are developing self-driving and driver assist technologies to rely on vision-based sensors, unlike alternative technologies in development that additionally require other redundant sensors. There is no guarantee that any incremental changes in the specific equipment we deploy in our vehicles over time will not result in initial functional disparities from prior iterations or will perform as expected in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all.\n\nOur products are also highly dependent on software, which is inherently complex and may contain latent defects or errors or be subject to external attacks. Issues experienced by our customers have included those related to the Model S and Model X 17inch display screen, the panoramic roof and the 12-volt battery in the Model S, the seats and doors in the Model X and the operation of solar panels installed by us. Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers. While we have performed extensive internal testing on our products and features, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate their long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to or installation for customers.\n\n## We may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims.\n\nThe automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims, and as such we face the risk of such claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other automakers, our vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and such accidents where Autopilot or FSD features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to face, claims and regulatory scrutiny arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures of such new technologies that we are pioneering. In addition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While we have designed our battery packs to passively contain any single cell's release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash. Likewise, as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity, they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property. Any product liability claim may subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages, product recalls or redesign efforts, and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it, all of which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time-consuming. In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance.\n\n## We will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects in order to succeed.\n\nIn order to maintain and grow our business, we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, investors, ratings agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing, delivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services; our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control. In particular, Tesla's products, business, results of operations, statements and actions are well-publicized by a range of third parties. Such attention includes frequent criticism, which is often exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team. Any such negative perceptions, whether caused by us or not, may harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.\n\n## We may be unable to effectively grow, or manage the compliance, residual value, financing and credit risks related to, our various financing programs.\n\nWe offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily ourselves and through various financial institutions. We also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain markets. Depending on the country, such arrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly with us",

      "question": "How do Home Depot (HD), Nike (NKE), and Starbucks (SBUX) each describe the impact of cybersecurity risks on their brand reputation, and what specific vulnerabilities or regulatory challenges do they highlight as unique threats to their respective brand equity?",
      "answer": "Home Depot (HD) emphasizes that cybersecurity breaches or data privacy failures could damage its brand and reputation, citing risks from geopolitical conflicts and nation-state actors exploiting vulnerabilities in software providers or internal processes. Nike (NKE) highlights that unauthorized disclosures of confidential business or consumer data could lead to a loss of reputation, market position, and stock price decline, particularly in light of evolving AI-related intellectual property risks. Starbucks (SBUX) warns that cybersecurity incidents could materially harm its brand, citing the increasing sophistication of attacks, including those leveraging AI technologies, and the potential for regulatory violations and litigation. Together, these companies show a shared concern over brand damage from cyber threats, but each emphasizes distinct vulnerabilities\u2014HD focuses on geopolitical threats, NKE on data leaks and AI-related IP risks, and SBUX on AI-enhanced cyberattacks and regulatory exposure.",

        "Hop 2: NKE \u2192 Brand: Nike states that unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential business information, including innovations or financial results, could lead to a loss of reputation, decline in market position, and stock price impact, especially as new technologies like AI raise novel intellectual property and brand-related legal concerns.",
        "Hop 3: SBUX \u2192 Brand: Starbucks warns that increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, particularly those enhanced by artificial intelligence, pose a material risk to its brand and reputation, and could lead to regulatory violations, litigation, and loss of customer trust."

The Company's estimated residual value of leased vehicles at the end of lease termwas $23.5 billion as of December 31, 2024.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |",

Shrink is the difference between the recorded amount of inv entory and the physical inv entory count. The Company calculates shrink based on actual inv entory losses identified as a result of physical inv entory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inv entory losses occurring between physical inv entory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inv entory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results.\n\nWe identified the ev aluation of the estimation of store shrink occurring in the period between physical inv entory counts and fiscal year-end as a critical audit matter.

We purchase, roast, and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products, and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impact our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1 of Part I of this 10-K, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I this 10-K.\n\n## FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices, and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually, and speculative trading activities are prohibited. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. We use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge against changes in the fair value of our net investments in foreign operations. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments and cross currency swaps, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, and Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nWe purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar, and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts and financial derivatives, to manage our commodity price risk exposure.\n\nThe following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 29, 2024, to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income ('OCI') from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions) :\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "across industry sectors for violations of the GDPR. The California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\"), which became operative in January 2020, and the California Privacy Rights Act, which is set to become operative in January 2023, each impose new privacy requirements and rights for consumers in California and has resulted and will continue to result in additional complexity and costs related to compliance. Many other jurisdictions have adopted or may adopt similar data protection regulations. These regulations are typically intended to protect the security of personal data that is collected, processed, and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction as well as to give individuals greater rights and/or control over how their data is processed. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information. These laws and their interpretations continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, the invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield in 2020 altered one of the acceptable approaches which many companies relied upon to ensure compliant data transfers between the European Union and the United States. Additionally, some of these regulations, such as the CCPA, give consumers a private right of action against companies for violations of these rules. While we have invested and continue to invest significant resources to comply with the GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations, many of these regulations (such as the Personal Information Protection Law in People's Republic of China (\"PRC\")) are new, complex, and subject to interpretation. Non-compliance with these laws could result in negative publicity, damage to our reputation, significant penalties, or other legal liability. If legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, our results of operations, financial condition, or competitive position could be adversely affected.\n\nCyberattacks and system vulnerabilities could lead to service outages, data loss, reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position.\n\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced rapid growth in consumer traffic to our online platforms, the number of accommodations on our extranets, and the geographic breadth of our operations. As the travel industry begins to recover, if our systems cannot be expanded to cope with increased demand or fail to perform, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times, decreased customer service and customer satisfaction, and delays in the introduction of new services, any of which could impair our reputation, damage our brands, and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Further, as an online business, we are dependent on the internet and maintaining connectivity between ourselves and consumers, sources of internet traffic, such as Google, and our travel service providers and restaurants. As consumers increasingly turn to mobile and other smart devices, we also become dependent on consumers' access to the internet through mobile carriers and their systems. Disruptions in internet access, especially if widespread or prolonged, could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. While we maintain redundant systems and hosting services, it is possible that we could experience an interruption in our business, and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur.\n\nWe have computer hardware for operating our services located in hosting facilities around the world. We do not have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every geographic region in which we conduct business, and these systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, computer viruses, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorism, and similar misconduct. In the event of any disruption of service at such facilities or the failure by such facilities to provide our required data communications capacity, we may not be able to switch to back-up systems immediately and it could result in lengthy interruptions or delays in our services. In addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff, these outages could create a significant amount of consumer questions and complaints that need to be addressed by customer support. Any system failure that causes an interruption or delay in service could impair our reputation, damage our brands, increase customer service costs, or result in lost business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We have taken and continue to take steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems. These steps are expensive, may reduce our margins, and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime.\n\nWe have experienced targeted and organized malware, phishing, and account takeover attacks, and may in the future experience these and other forms of attack such as ransomware, SQL injection (where a third party attempts to insert malicious code into our software through data entry fields in our websites in order to gain control of the system), and attempts to use our websites as a platform to launch a denial-of-service attack on another party. Our existing security measures may not be successful in preventing attacks on our systems. For instance, from time to time, we have experienced denial-of-service type attacks on our systems that have made portions of our websites slow or unavailable for periods of time. Traditional IT business continuity and disaster recovery practices are less effective against certain types of attacks such as ransomware or malware. A ransomware attack could result in our services being unavailable for an extended period of time, nullify our data, or expose our payment card and personal data. Reductions in the availability and response time of our online services could cause loss of substantial business volumes during the occurrence of any such attack on our systems and measures we may take to divert",

As we continue to assess our performance throughout our regions, we may take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations, which may result in material asset write-downs or impairments and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. In addition, these restructuring actions subject us to increased risks of labor unrest or strikes, supplier, dealer, or other third-party litigation, regulator claims or proceedings, negative publicity  and  business  disruption.  Failure  to  realize  anticipated  savings  or  benefits  from  our  restructuring  and/or  cost  reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and cash flows.\n\n## Risks related to our intellectual property, cybersecurity, information technology and data management practices\n\nCompetitors  may  independently  develop  products  and  services  similar  to  ours,  and  there  are  no  guarantees  that  GM's intellectual  property  rights  would  prevent  competitors  from  independently  developing  or  selling  those  products  and  services. There may be instances where, notwithstanding our intellectual property position, competitive products or services may impact the value  of  our  brands  and  other  intangible  assets,  and  our  business  may  be  adversely  affected.  Moreover,  although  GM  takes reasonable  steps  to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of  GM  proprietary  information,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  such  efforts  will completely  deter  or  prevent  misappropriation  or  improper  use  of  our  intellectual  property.  We  sometimes  face  attempts  to  gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, we may be the target of patent enforcement actions by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. Although we have taken steps to mitigate such risks, if we are found to have infringed any third-party intellectual property rights, we could be required to  pay  substantial  damages,  or  we  could  be  enjoined  from  offering  some  of  our  products  and  services.  In  addition,  to  prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement, misappropriation or other violation  of  our  intellectual  property  against  third  parties. Any  such  action  could  result  in  significant  costs  and  diversion  of  our resources and management's attention, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any such action.\n\nSecurity  breaches  and  other  disruptions  to  information  technology  systems  and  networked  products,  including  connected vehicles,  owned  or  maintained  by  us,  GM  Financial,  or  third-parties,  such  as  vendors  or  suppliers,  could  interfere  with  our operations  and  could  compromise  the  confidentiality  of  private  customer  data  or  our  proprietary  information. We rely  upon information technology systems and manufacture networked and connected products, some of which are managed by third parties, to process,  transmit  and  store  electronic  information  and  to  manage  or  support  a  variety  of  our  business  processes,  activities  and products. Additionally, we and GM Financial collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary business information  (including  that  of  our  dealers  and  suppliers),  as  well  as  personally  identifiable  information  of  our  customers  and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks (including networks that may be controlled or maintained by third parties). The secure operation of these systems and products, and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these systems and products, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Further, customers using our systems rely on the security  of  our  infrastructure,  including  hardware  and  other  elements  provided  by  third  parties,  to  ensure  the  reliability  of  our products and the protection of their data. We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of  any  of  the  third  parties  that  facilitate  our  business  activities,  including  vendors,  service  providers,  suppliers,  customers, counterparties, exchanges, clearing agents, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties and other third parties who provide  us  services  or  with  whom  we  communicate  could  also  be  the  source  of  a  cyberattack  on,  or  breach  of,  our  operational systems, network, data or infrastructure. Despite our security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology systems  and  networked  and  connected  products  may  be  vulnerable  to  damage,  disruptions  or  shutdowns  caused  by  attacks  by hackers,  computer  viruses,  malware  (including  'ransomware'),  phishing  attacks  or  breaches  due  to  errors  or  malfeasance  by employees, contractors and others who have access to these systems and products. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise the confidentiality, operational integrity and accessibility of these systems and products and the data that resides within them.  Similarly,  such  an  occurrence  could  result  in  the  compromise  or  loss  of  the  information  processed  by  these  systems  and products.  Such  events  could  result  in,  among  other  things,  the  loss  of  proprietary  data,  interruptions  or  delays  in  our  business operations  and  damage  to  our  reputation.  In  addition,  such  events  could  increase  the  risk  of  claims  alleging  that  we  are  noncompliant with applicable laws or regulations, subjecting us to potential liability or regulatory penalties and related costs under laws protecting the privacy of personal information; disrupt our operations; or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies. Various events described above have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Although impacts of past events have been immaterial, the impacts of such events in the future may be material.\n\nSecurity  breaches  and  other  disruptions  of  our  in-vehicle  systems  could  impact  the  safety  of  our  customers  and  reduce confidence in GM and our products .

This includes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the U.S. and abroad. While, we maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-attacks or misappropriation, our systems and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, social engineering, computer hacking, unauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects and vulnerabilities, breakdowns, damage, interruptions, system malfunctions, power outages, terrorism, acts of vandalism, security breaches, security incidents, inadvertent or intentional actions by employees or other third parties, and other cyber-attacks.\n\nTo the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition, use, corruption, loss, destruction, alteration or dissemination of our data, including intellectual property and personal information, or our products or vehicles, or for it to be believed or reported that any of these occurred, it could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable data breach notification laws, subject us to time consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm.\n\nWe also rely on service providers, and similar incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks. Our service providers, including our workforce management software provider, have been subject to ransomware and other security incidents, and we cannot guarantee that our or our service providers' systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident, or other disruption to, our or our service providers' systems. Our ability to monitor our service providers' security measures is limited, and, in any event, malicious third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures.\n\nFurther, the implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost, and there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating current systems, including disruptions to the related areas of business operation. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service products, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations.\n\nMoreover, if we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to accurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results.

      "answer": "Lowe's highlights the importance of maintaining appropriate inventory levels to meet customer demand and prevent shrink, noting that higher rates of shrink\u2014sometimes due to organized retail crime\u2014can increase costs and harm the customer experience. Nike emphasizes the risk of forecasting inaccuracies leading to either excess inventory, which can damage brand image through discounted sales, or inventory shortages that can harm retailer relationships and brand loyalty. Tesla discusses the complexity of forecasting and managing high-volume component purchases for vehicle production, warning that mismatches in timing or quantities could lead to production disruptions, storage costs, and write-offs. Together, these perspectives illustrate that while inventory mismanagement poses brand and financial risks across sectors, the nature of those risks varies significantly\u2014from shrink and customer experience in retail, to demand forecasting and brand dilution in consumer goods, to complex supply chain coordination in automotive manufacturing.",

Our public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customers shop at Lowe's, our vendors want to do business with Lowe's, and our associates want to work for Lowe's. We must continue to manage, preserve, and grow Lowe's public image and reputation. Lowe's actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation. In addition, failure to meet our stated environmental and social objectives, and consumer, shareholder, and other stakeholder concerns about our environmental and social practices are potential sources of reputational risk. V endors and others with whom we do business may affect our reputation. Any negative incident can erode trust and confidence quickly, and adverse publicity about us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers' confidence, reduce demand for our products and services, affect our relationships with current and future vendors, impact our results of operations, affect our ability to recruit, retain, and engage our associates, and attract regulatory scrutiny. The significant ex pansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incidents. We have been, and in the future may be, subject to criticism in the media and negative social media campaigns related to certain initiatives, including those related to diversity and inclusion, and changes in those initiatives. Widespread dissemination of such criticism at times may adversely impact our relationships with our associates, customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders. In addition, the use of social media platforms and other technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination and given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other actions.\n\nAdditionally, our proprietary rights in our trademarks, trade names, service marks, domain names, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets of our business. We may not be able to prevent or even discover every instance of unauthorized third-party uses of our intellectual property or dilution of our brand names, such as when a third party uses trademarks that are identical or similar to our own. If we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers, expose us to litigation and negatively impact our sales, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.\n\nProduct and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in Lowe's and our brand image. If our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety or quality, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial, and reputational risks. As a result, Lowe's reputation as a retailer of high-quality products and services, including both national and Lowe's private brands, could suffer and impact customer loyalty. Additionally, we and our customers have expectations on responsible sourcing and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Under our Vendor Code of Conduct, our vendors are required to meet our expectations across multiple areas of compliance, including health and safety, environmental standards, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. Where appropriate, we request that our vendors provide additional documentation proving their compliance in these areas. If we need to seek alternative sources of supply from vendors with whom we have less familiarity, the risk of our standards not being met may increase. Actual, potential, or perceived product safety concerns or vendor non-compliance exposes us to litigation, as well as government enforcement action, and could, and in certain instances in the past has, resulted in costly product recalls, the inability to sell certain products due to customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and exclusions, and other liabilities.\n\nOur sales and profitability depend on our ability to maintain our store base and maintain appropriate levels of inventory and failure to do so may affect our business, financial condition and result of operations.\n\nWe have a store base that requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. Our capital investments in our stores may not deliver the convenience or relevant shopping experience our customers expect. It is important that we maintain appropriate levels of inventory in our stores and supply chain facilities and respond to changing customer demands. We must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates, as well as to protect against loss or theft of our inventory (known as 'shrink'). Higher rates of shrink, which we have experienced from time to time, including as a result of organized retail crime, can require operational changes that may increase costs and adversely impact customer and associate experience.",

In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China, Germany and any future sites such as Mexico. We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our product ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets.\n\nWe have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and Solar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future products, features and services based on artificial intelligence. Likewise, we may encounter delays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products. In addition, as we continue to develop our artificial intelligence services and products, we may face many additional challenges, including the availability and cost of energy, processing power limitations and the substantial power requirements for our data centers.\n\nAny delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of our future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Our suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, or we may be unable to manage these components effectively.\n\nOur products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers, which exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages. Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, including inflation of raw material costs, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics, trade and shipping disruptions, port congestions, cyberattacks and other factors beyond our or our suppliers' control could also affect these suppliers' ability to deliver technologies or components to us or to remain solvent and operational. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, or face other challenges such as insolvency, it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our production or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time. We have faced in the past, and may face suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, which may increase our costs or require us to replace them with other sources. Finally, as we construct new manufacturing facilities and add production lines to existing facilities, we may experience issues in correspondingly increasing the level of localized procurement at those facilities. While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce, especially in the case of increases in materials pricing. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\nAs the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which may harm our business and operating results.\n\n## We may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines, costs and production ramps at new factories, or we may experience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there.\n\nOur ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future factories.

      "question": "How do AMZN's logistics infrastructure leasing, GM's fleet sales strategy, and HD's vehicle leasing practices each reflect different financial exposures and strategic approaches to vehicle utilization in their respective business models?",
      "answer": "AMZN disclosed that it leases vehicles as part of its logistics infrastructure, with significant capital tied up in leased assets under finance leases, including $68.1 billion and $72.2 billion in gross assets as of the end of 2020 and 2021 respectively. This reflects a strategic capital allocation to maintain control over delivery infrastructure while managing cash flow through leasing arrangements. GM, on the other hand, actively sells vehicles to fleet customers such as rental car companies and governments, noting that these transactions are 'generally less profitable than retail sales to end customers.' This highlights a strategic trade-off between volume and margin in fleet sales. HD also leases vehicles, though the 10-K does not specify a dollar amount, with lease terms typically ranging from one to 20 years, often with extension options. HD's leasing approach provides operational flexibility without long-term asset commitments. Comparing all three, AMZN uses vehicle leasing to vertically integrate its delivery network, GM leverages fleet sales for volume despite margin compression, and HD adopts leasing for flexibility rather than asset control. These differing strategies reveal contrasting risk profiles: AMZN and HD face long-term lease liabilities, while GM faces lower per-unit profitability in fleet sales.",

Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing their undiscounted future cash flows with their carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows, we then measure the asset's fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. If the resulting fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. Impairment losses on property and equipment are recorded as a component of SG&amp;A.

LOW identifies security issues at U.S. ports as a key risk factor that could disrupt supply chain operations and increase costs, especially in light of recent port congestion and labor disputes. NKE emphasizes the risks posed by cyber-attacks, including phishing, malware, and ransomware, which threaten the reliability of its information technology systems and could delay product fulfillment and damage its reputation.

We source, stock, and sell products from domestic and international vendors, and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success. Catastrophic events, extreme weather conditions, public health crises, and global economic and political conditions may adversely affect our global supply chain. For example, impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic placed strains on the domestic and international supply chain, which negatively affected the flow and availability of our products in the past, due to difficulties in timely obtaining products from the manufacturers and suppliers of our products.\n\nWe source, both directly and indirectly, a portion of the products we sell from foreign manufacturers, with China and Mexico being the dominant import sources. Tax and trade policies, tariffs, and other regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries, such as China and Mexico, increase the cost of our merchandise sourced from outside of the United States, which represents a large percentage of our private branded and national brand merchandise. It remains unclear how tax or trade policies, tariffs, customs actions, or trade relations may evolve in the future, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, effective income tax rate, liquidity, and net income. In addition, other countries have responded by changing their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy and regulations already enacted or that may be enacted in the future. Complications in the free movement of goods in North America, an escalation of tariff activity elsewhere in the world or changes to existing free trade agreements, like the United StatesMexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), could adversely impact our financial results. Increased import tariffs and other changes in trade policy could also negatively impact consumer demand for the products we sell. In addition to the potential direct impacts of increased tariff activity, longer term macroeconomic consequences could result, including slower growth, inflation, and higher interest rates. The degree of our ex posure is dependent on, among other things, the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of tariffs. The impact to our business, including net sales and gross margin, will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nFinancial instability among key vendors, political instability, geopolitical or armed conflicts, and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain, changes in the total costs in our supply chain (including fuel), labor costs or labor shortages among our vendors, port labor disputes and security, the outbreak of pandemics, weather-related events, natural disasters, work stoppages, shipping capacity restraints, shipping delays and disruptions, changes in trade policy, retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the United States or a major source country, tariffs or duties, customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and ex clusions, fluctuations in transport availability, capacity, and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs. In recent years, U.S. ports have been impacted by capacity constraints, port congestion and delays, periodic labor disputes, security issues, weather-related events, and natural disasters.\n\nAdditionally, as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements, our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex  and operating it becomes more challenging. If our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, we experience delays in inventory, increased delivery costs, or merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence, and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nThe execution of initiatives to transform our supply chain network could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these investments might not provide the anticipated benefits.\n\nWe continue to transform and expand our supply chain network and existing omnichannel capabilities to meet changing customer needs. These investments are designed to promote greater network capacity and better flow management and optimization while leveraging a market delivery model. Failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. If we are unable to effectively manage the volume, timing, nature, location, and cost of these investments, projects, and changes, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. The cost and potential problems, defects of design, and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with implementing new technologies, restructuring support systems and processes, securing appropriate facility locations, addressing impacts on inventory levels, and managing thirdparty service providers, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and impact our profitability. Our investments to enhance and expand our supply chain might not provide the anticipated benefits, or might take longer than expected to complete or realize anticipated benefits, or might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.",

These factors and others have also made, and may continue to make, it more difficult to maintain an effective system of operational internal controls for a dispersed workforce, and to train partners to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience. Additionally, there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers, who are necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. If we are unable to recruit, retain, and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in the availability and cost of labor could adversely affect our business.\n\nOur business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs, both domestically and internationally. Such increases could be triggered by state and federal legislation and regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling, and benefits; increases in healthcare and workers' compensation insurance costs; and increases in wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high-quality employees with the right skill sets. For ex ample, at the federal level, effective July 1, 2024, the United States Department of Labor increased the minimum salary threshold requirements for employees who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act overtime requirements, and at the state level, Assembly Bill 1228 increased minimum wage and established working hour and working condition standards for certain partners in California. These changes, along with others that may occur in the future, could have a significant impact on the classification of employees as being exempt from overtime and add to our labor costs. The growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of employees, to maintain an effective system of operational internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise, and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience; the failure to do so could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, a shortage of labor for store positions, and the increased availability of alternative telecommuting employment options by other employers could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for other key functions. In addition, our wages and benefits programs may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent.\n\nStarting in September 2021, Starbucks partners at a number of company-operated stores sought union representation through elections conducted by the National Labor Relations Board. Unions have secured representation rights at hundreds of our more than 10,000 U.S. company-operated stores, with potentially more to follow, and Starbucks is engaged in collective bargaining for initial collective bargaining agreements for these stores. If we encounter difficulties negotiating collective bargaining agreements, are unsuccessful in those efforts, or obtain contracts with unfavorable terms, then we could incur additional costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility, and increase our operational complexity. These risks could also present the potential to disrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully implement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business needs.\n\nThe law places limitations on unilateral actions taken with respect to employees who are represented by unions because, in certain circumstances, the law requires the employer to notify and to bargain with the union prior to making certain operational or other changes that may affect employee wages, hours, or other terms and conditions of employment. Moreover, where a petition for representation has been filed by a union, the employer is also constrained from making changes in wages, hours, and working conditions. These limitations could also negatively affect our costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility, and increase our operational complexity. They also present the potential to disrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully implement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business needs.\n\nMoreover, we have experienced job actions in some company-operated stores. Such job actions and work stoppages have the potential to negatively impact our operations, third-party providers upon whom we rely to deliver product, our sales and customer flow in impacted locations, our costs, and can also have a negative impact on our reputation and brand.\n\nAdditionally, our position with respect to unions and the unionization of partners could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and could have material adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results. These positions could also expose us to legal risk, causing us to incur costs to defend legal and regulatory actions, potential penalties and restrictions, and reputational harm.\n\n## Risks Related to Competition\n\n## We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.\n\nThe specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience (such as delivery service and mobile ordering), and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all of these areas in each of our channels and markets. Accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. In the U.S., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to Starbucks stores and/or average value per transaction, adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. Similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors, or \u00ae",

In addition, decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Operations\n\n## We may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our Gigafactories, which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products.\n\nOur plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. We also produce several vehicle components at our Gigafactories, such as battery modules and packs and drive units, and manufacture energy storage products. If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, which may harm our business and operating results.\n\nFinally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured by us and by our suppliers are stored and recycled at our various facilities. Any mishandling of these products may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.\n\n## We face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions.\n\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable. Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., with additional manufacturing operations in China and Europe, create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements; enforceability of our contractual rights; trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or ex change controls; and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products. For example, we monitor tax legislation changes on a global basis, including changes arising as a result of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting. Such conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention, and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them effectively.\n\n## Our business may suffer if our products or features contain defects, fail to perform as expected or take longer than expected to become fully functional.\n\nIf our products contain design or manufacturing defects, whether relating to our software or hardware, that cause them not to perform as designed or intended or that require repair, or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD (Supervised) features take longer than expected to become enabled, are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services may be harmed, and we may experience delivery delays, product recalls, allegations of product liability, breach of warranty and related consumer protection claims and significant warranty and other expenses. While we are continuously working to develop and improve our products' capability and performance, there is no guarantee that any incremental changes in the specific software or equipment we deploy in our vehicles over time will not result in initial functional disparities from prior iterations or will perform as forecast in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers. We have performed, and continue to perform, extensive internal testing on our products and features, though, like the rest of the industry, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate certain aspects of their long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics, including exposure to or consequence of external attacks. While we attempt to identify and address or remedy defects we identify pre-production and sale, there may be latent defects that we may be unable to detect or control for in our products, and thereby address, prior to their sale to or installation for customers.",

      "answer": "GM quantifies its financial exposure tied to local laws through repossession rights on delinquent retail finance receivables, which totaled $958 million at December 31, 2024. These receivables are subject to local legal frameworks that govern collateral enforcement, highlighting a direct financial risk tied to regulatory variability across jurisdictions. HD emphasizes the potential financial consequences of regulatory non-compliance, including the loss of general contractor licenses, fines, and reputational damage, as seen in their prior EPA-related consent decree. The company also notes that high interest rates\u2014driven by central bank actions\u2014have negatively impacted demand for large remodeling projects, linking macro-policy to financial performance. LOW, in contrast, states that compliance with federal, state, and local laws is not expected to have a material effect on its capital expenditures or competitive position, suggesting a lower regulatory burden or more stable compliance framework. When combined, these disclosures show that regulatory exposure varies significantly by business model: GM faces direct asset risk through consumer finance, HD faces operational and reputational risk through contractor oversight, and LOW perceives regulatory compliance as a stable, non-material cost of doing business.",

As such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of background checks, licensing, permitting, and handling of env ironmental risks, as well as quality of work performed by our third-party installers. We hav e established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and manage customer satisfaction with the serv ices prov ided by our third-party installers. However, as we experienced in part with the EPA inv estigation and the resulting consent decree in April 2021, and the subsequent discussions with the EPA regarding compliance with the consent decree, if we fail to manage these processes effectiv ely, collect the appropriate documentation, perform regular job site inspections, or prov ide proper ov ersight of these serv ices, we could lose sales or face fines or lawsuits, including gov ernmental enforcement actions for v iolations of regulatory requirements, as well as claims for property damage or personal injury. In addition, we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could adv ersely affect our business.\n\n## LEGAL, FINANCIAL, REGULATORY, GLOBAL AND OTHER EXTERNAL RISKS\n\nUncertainty regarding the housing and home improvement markets, economic conditions, political and social climate, public health issues, and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance.\n\nOur financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing and home improv ement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. Adv erse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets, the economy, or the political or social climate could adv ersely impact, and we believ e in some cases has adv ersely impacted, our customers' confidence or financial condition, causing them to decide against purchasing home improv ement products and serv ices, causing them to delay purchasing decisions, or impacting their ability to pay for products and serv ices. Other factors beyond our control - including unemployment and foreclosure rates; inv entory loss due to theft (including as a result of organized retail crime); inflation or deflation; interest rate fluctuations, including central banks' actions to control inflation; fuel and other energy costs; raw material or other shortages; labor and healthcare costs; the av ailability of financing; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; changes in policy and regulations, including with respect to tax rates; prolonged gov ernment shutdowns; weather and natural disasters (including the potential impacts of climate change); acts of terrorism or v iolence, including activ e shooter situations; public health issues, including pandemics and related impacts; geopolitical or military conflicts or acts of war, as well as any related sanctions or other gov ernment or priv ate responses; and civ il unrest, could further adv ersely affect, and in certain cases has adv ersely affected, demand for our products and serv ices, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance. For instance, a number of merchandise categories were impacted by inflation in recent years due to, among other things, global supply chain disruptions and the uncertain economic and geopolitical env ironment. In an effort to address inflation, central banks raised interest rates. Notwithstanding recent rate cuts, the high interest rate env ironment that persisted throughout fiscal 2024 has adversely impacted and may continue to adv ersely impact demand for larger remodeling projects. Additionally, the inflationary outlook in the U.S. is currently uncertain, and persistent or increasing inflation could lead to a rev ersal of recent reductions in interest rates.\n\nFurther, our specialty trade and MRO customers, who hav e higher spend and longer-term relationships than a typical retail customer, primarily use trade credit to finance their purchases, and some of our other Pros use trade credit in order to purchase our products. As a result, their ability to pay is highly dependent on the economic strength of the industry in their areas. If these customers are unable to repay the trade credit from us, we may face greater default risk, which could reduce our cash flow and adv ersely affect our results of operations.\n\nOur costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state, local or international laws, regulations and executive orders.\n\nWe are subject to v arious U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as international laws and regulations, that gov ern numerous aspects of our business. In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations hav e been adopted, new executiv e orders hav e been announced, there has been expanded enforcement and differing interpretations of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state, local and international agencies, and the interpretation of certain laws and regulations has become increasingly complex.

Our installed sales model, which separates selling and project administration tasks, allows our sales associates to focus on project selling, while project managers ensure that the details related to installing the products are efficiently ex ecuted.  We are simplifying the process through a team of remote associates that we call our central selling team. This team handles building quotes, answering questions over video or phone call, and providing personalized support to our customers. We are also implementing technology that allows our customers to finalize their installation contract and checkout on lowes.com or mobile application, so they do not need to return to the store. Installed sales, which includes both product and labor, accounted for approximately 5% of total sales in fiscal 2024.\n\n## Lowe's Protection Plans and Repair Services\n\nWe offer extended protection plans for certain products within the Appliances, Kitchens &amp; Bath, D\u00e9cor, Millwork, Rough Plumbing, Electrical, Seasonal &amp; Outdoor Living, Tools, and Hardware categories. These protection plans provide customers with product protection that enhances the coverage offered by the manufacturer's warranty and provide additional benefits and repair services that extend beyond the manufacturer's warranty.\n\n## Seasonality and Working Capital\n\nThe home improvement business in general is subject to seasonal influences, particularly related to the spring selling season.  Historically, we have realized the highest volume of sales during our second fiscal quarter (May, June, and July) and the lowest volume of sales during our fourth fiscal quarter (November, December, and January).  Accordingly, our working capital requirements have historically been greater during our fourth fiscal quarter as we build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season and as we experience lower fourth fiscal quarter sales volumes.  We fund our working capital requirements primarily through cash flows generated from operations, but also with short-term borrowings, as needed.  For more detailed information, see the Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations', of this Annual Report.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nThe name 'Lowe's' is a registered service mark of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We consider this mark and logo and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition to be valuable to our business. This subsidiary owns and maintains various additional registered and unregistered trademarks, service marks and trade names, including private brand product names, such as, 'Kobalt', 'STAINMASTER', and 'allen+roth.' This subsidiary also maintains various Internet domain names that are important to our business, and we also own registered and unregistered copyrights. In addition, we maintain patent portfolios related to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect certain innovations that we incorporate into our products, services, or business operations.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe are subject to a wide array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations. We do not currently expect compliance with these laws and regulations to have a material effect on our capital ex penditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nWhen it comes to attracting and retaining top talent, Lowe's strives to be the employer of choice in retail. At Lowe's we are committed to creating valuable career opportunities for our associates, supporting them and the communities where they live, and cultivating a culture that invites and encourages diverse opinions and ideas. We would like our associates to see Lowe's as a 'Home to Possibility' with good jobs, a sense of belonging, and a promising future.\n\nAs a testament to our commitments, in fiscal 2024 we received several notable employer of choice awards, including being named on the Disability:IN National Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion, Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies Specialty Retailer, 2024 Great Place to Work Certified - U.S. and India, Fair360 Top 50 Noteworthy Company for Workplace Fairness, 2024 American Opportunity Index Top 100 Company, and a Best Corporation for Veteran's Business Enterprises of the Year.",

LOW specifies that its RSUs generally vest 50% after two years and 50% after three years, with some vesting 100% after three years, and also highlights performance-based conditions for certain units. MCD, while not detailing a specific vesting schedule, notes that $144.9 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years. Additionally, MCD\u2019s stock options typically vest in four equal installments starting one year after the grant date.

          "chunk_text": "## U.S. Tax Reform\n\nIn December 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law in the United States. The Tax Act made significant changes to U.S. federal tax law, including a one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated unremitted international earnings, to be paid over eight years.\n\nIn 2018, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $46 million to adjust its provisional income tax expense that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 relating to the federal one-time deemed repatriation liability, as well as U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation. In addition, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $2 million in 2018 to adjust the remeasurement of its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate that resulted from the Tax Act.\n\nIn 2019, as a result of additional technical guidance issued by U.S. federal and state tax authorities with respect to the Tax Act, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $17 million to adjust its income tax expense that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 relating to the federal one-time deemed repatriation liability, as well as U.S. state income taxes associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation.\n\nIn 2020, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $8 million to adjust its income tax expense that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 relating to the federal one-time deemed repatriation liability. This benefit was primarily due to additional tax credits. The Company utilized $108 million of deferred tax assets related to U.S. federal net operating losses (\"NOLs\") and $115 million of other tax credit carryforwards to reduce its transition tax liability as of December 31, 2021.\n\nUnder the Tax Act, the Company's future cash generated by the Company's international operations can generally be repatriated without further U.S. federal income tax, but will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes, which have been accrued by the Company.\n\nThe Tax Act also introduced in 2018 a tax on 50% of GILTI, which is income determined to be in excess of a specified routine rate of return, and a base erosion and anti-abuse tax (\"BEAT\") aimed at preventing the erosion of the U.S. tax base. The Company has adopted an accounting policy to treat taxes on GILTI as period costs.\n\n## Deferred Income Taxes\n\nThe Company utilized $309 million of its U.S. NOLs to reduce its U.S. federal tax liability for the deemed repatriation tax. After utilization of available NOLs, at December 31, 2021, the Company had U.S. federal NOLs of $267 million, the majority of which do not have an expiration date, and U.S. state NOLs of $536 million, which mainly begin to expire in years December 31, 2032 and forward. In addition, at December 31, 2021, the Company had $700 million of non-U.S. NOLs, and $23 million of U.S. research tax credit and foreign tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future tax liabilities, the majority of which do not have an expiration date.\n\nThe utilization of these NOLs, allowances, and credits is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income and the tax laws in the jurisdictions where the losses were generated. The Company periodically evaluates the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduces the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent it believes a portion will not be realized. The Company considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of the deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, tax planning strategies, the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors.",

      "answer": "Lowe's has a long-standing relationship with U.S. Bank National Association as a successor trustee, issuing multiple tranches of notes with maturities ranging from 2017 to 2040, including 1.625% Notes due in April 2017 and 4.650% Notes maturing in April 2022. Starbucks, through multiple Supplemental Indentures from 2019 to 2022, issued a variety of senior notes with U.S. Bank National Association as trustee, including Floating Rate Notes due 2024 and 3.000% Senior Notes due 2032. Tesla, through its subsidiary SolarCity, entered into multiple Supplemental Indentures with U.S. Bank National Association to issue Solar Bonds, including 4.70% Solar Bonds Series 2015/C19-10 and 5.45% Solar Bonds Series 2015/C20-15. The comparative analysis shows that Lowe's focuses on long-term fixed-rate debt, Starbucks leverages a mix of short-to-long-term notes with specific maturity targeting, and Tesla utilizes structured solar financing instruments, reflecting distinct capital structure and strategic funding priorities within the consumer discretionary sector.",

Lowe\u2019s has a slightly larger presence with 11 stores in Iowa, suggesting a comparable level of investment in the state. Unlike Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, which report specific store counts, Starbucks does not disclose store counts per state but emphasizes a strategy of placing stores in high-traffic, high-visibility locations, including rural and off-highway sites. This suggests that while Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s maintain modest physical presences in Iowa, Starbucks focuses on strategic placement over sheer volume, potentially prioritizing customer accessibility and convenience in its store expansion.",

Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth.\n\nThe People's Republic of China ('PRC') and India regulate Amazon's and its affiliates' businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely.\n\n## The Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations\n\nDemand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, promotions, product launches, or unforeseeable events, such as in response to natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), or geopolitical events. For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, splitshipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable",

Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact. Forward-looking  statements  represent  our  current  judgment  about  possible  future  events  and  are  often  identified  by  words  like 'aim,'  'anticipate,'  'appears,'  'approximately,'  'believe,'  'continue,'  'could,'  'designed,'  'effect,'  'estimate,'  'evaluate,' 'expect,'  'forecast,'  'goal,'  'initiative,'  'intend,'  'may,'  'objective,'  'outlook,'  'plan,'  'potential,'  'priorities,'  'project,' 'pursue,'  'seek,'  'should,'  'target,'  'when,'  'will,'  'would,'  or  the  negative  of  any  of  those  words  or  similar  expressions.  In making these statements, we rely on assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these  judgments  are  reasonable,  but  these  statements  are  not  guarantees  of  any  future  events  or  financial  results,  and  our  actual results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors, which may be  revised  or  supplemented  in  subsequent  reports  we  file  with  the  SEC,  include,  among  others,  the  following:  (1)  our  ability  to deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry; (2) our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models, including electric vehicles, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers; (3) our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of electric vehicles that will help drive consumer adoption; (4) the success of our current line of full-size SUVs and full-size pickup trucks; (5) our highly competitive industry, which has been historically characterized by excess manufacturing capacity and the use of  incentives,  and  the  introduction  of  new  and  improved  vehicle  models  by  our  competitors;  (6)  the  unique  technological, operational,  regulatory  and  competitive  risks  related  to  the  timing  and  commercialization  of  autonomous  vehicles;  (7)  risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, our transition to electric vehicles and the  potential  increased  impacts  of  severe  weather  events;  (8)  global  automobile  market  sales  volume,  which  can  be  volatile;  (9) prices  and  uncertain  availability  of  raw  materials  and  commodities  used  by  us  and  our  suppliers,  and  instability  in  logistics  and related costs; (10) our business in China, which is subject to unique operational, competitive, regulatory and economic risks; (11) the success of our ongoing strategic business relationships and of our joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which we may have limited control; (12) the international scale and footprint of our operations, which exposes us to a variety of unique  political,  economic,  competitive  and  regulatory  risks,  including  the  risk  of  changes  in  government  leadership  and  laws (including  labor,  trade,  tax  and  other  laws),  political  uncertainty  or  instability  and  economic  tensions  between  governments  and changes in international trade policies, new barriers to entry and changes to or withdrawals from free trade agreements, changes in foreign  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates,  economic  downturns  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  differing  local  product preferences and product requirements, changes to and compliance with U.S. and foreign countries' export controls and economic sanctions,  differing  labor  regulations,  requirements  and  union  relationships,  differing  dealer  and  franchise  regulations  and relationships,  difficulties  in  obtaining  financing  in  foreign  countries,  and  public  health  crises,  including  the  occurrence  of  a contagious disease or illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; (13) any significant disruption, including any work stoppages, at any of our manufacturing facilities; (14) the ability of our suppliers to deliver parts, systems and components without disruption and at such times to allow us to meet production schedules; (15) the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; (16) the success of any restructurings or  other  cost  reduction  actions;  (17)  the  possibility  that  competitors  may  independently  develop  products  and  services  similar  to ours, or that our intellectual property rights are not sufficient to prevent competitors from developing or selling those products or services; (18) our ability to manage risks related to security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology systems and networked products, including connected vehicles and in-vehicle systems; (19) our ability to comply with increasingly complex, restrictive and punitive regulations relating to our enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing and security of the Personal  Identifiable  Information  of  our  customers,  employees,  or  suppliers;  (20)  our  ability  to  comply  with  extensive  laws, regulations  and  policies  applicable  to  our  operations  and  products,  including  those  relating  to  fuel  economy,  emissions  and autonomous vehicles; (21) costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations; (22) the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services; (23) any additional tax expense or exposure; (24) our continued ability to develop captive financing capability through GM Financial; and (25) any significant increase in our pension funding requirements.

Such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations, which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of non-compliance. Changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, including increased or additional regulations and associated costs to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, incremental investments and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are subject to additional domestic and foreign governmental regulations and health guidelines, as well as any other voluntary safety protocols.\n\nIn addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area. Current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the GDPR and the CCPA, discussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable international and U.S. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of fines, litigation or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business.\n\nThe complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related costs of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\n\n## Item 1B.

Starbucks utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of its cash flow hedging strategy, recording gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and reclassifying them to interest expense over the life of the related debt.

During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill due to the use of preliminary information in our initial estimates. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n\n## MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES\n\nWe value the majority of our inv entory under the retail inv entory method, with the remainder of our inv entories v alued under a cost method, primarily the first-in, first-out method. Under the retail inv entory method, inv entories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail v alue of inv entories.\n\nThe retail v alue of our inv entory is adjusted as needed to reflect current market conditions. Because these adjustments are based on current prev ailing market conditions, the v alue of our inv entory approximates the lower of cost or market. The v aluation under the retail inv entory method is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inv entory losses (or shrink). As such, there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inv entory cost and gross profit. We determine markups and markdowns based on the consideration of a v ariety of factors such as current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and buying trends, age of the merchandise, and weather conditions.\n\nWe calculate shrink based on actual inv entory losses identified as a result of physical inv entory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inv entory losses occurring between physical inv entory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inv entory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. A 10% increase in the shrink rate used to estimate our inv entory shrink reserv e would hav e increased cost of sales by approximately $95 million for fiscal 2024. Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inv entory losses has not been material to our annual financial results.\n\nWe do not believ e there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to v alue our inv entory under the retail inv entory method. We believ e that the retail inv entory method prov ides an inv entory v aluation which approximates cost and results in v aluing our inv entory at the lower of cost or market.\n\n## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nFor information on our accounting policies and on accounting pronouncements that hav e impacted or may materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Item 7A . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures A bout Market Risk.\n\n## INTEREST RATE RISK\n\nWe have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our long-term debt portfolio. We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed/floating-rate debt portfolio, none of which are for trading or speculativ e purposes. At February 2, 2025, after giv ing consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, floating-rate debt principal was $6.0 billion, or approximately 12% of our senior notes portfolio. Our interest rate swap agreements were in an aggregate liability position of $795 million at February 2, 2025. The changes in the fair v alues of our interest rate swap agreements offset the changes in the fair v alue of the hedged long-term debt. Based on our February 2, 2025 floating-rate debt principal, a one percentage point increase in the interest rate of floating-rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $60 million.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK\n\nWe are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. We use deriv ativ e instruments to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk, none of which are for trading or speculativ e purposes. Our foreign currency related hedging arrangements outstanding at the end of fiscal 2024 were not material.",

The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2024. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued guidance expanding segment disclosure requirements. The amendments require enhanced disclosure for certain segment items and disclosure on how management uses reported measures to assess segment performance. The amendments do not change how segments are determined, aggregated, or how thresholds are applied to determine reportable segments. We expect to adopt the guidance for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2025. We are currently evaluating the expanded disclosure requirements and do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance expanding disclosure requirements related to income taxes. The amendments require enhanced jurisdictional disclosures for the income tax rate reconciliation and related to cash income tax es paid. Additionally, certain disclosures related to unrecognized tax  benefits and indefinite reinvestment assertions were removed. The amendments are effective for our fiscal year ending September 27, 2026. While we are still evaluating the specific impacts and timing of adoption, we anticipate this guidance will have a significant impact on our annual income tax disclosures.\n\nIn March 2024, the SEC issued its final climate disclosure rules, which require the disclosure of climate-related information in annual reports and registration statements. The rules require disclosure in the audited financial statements of certain effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions above certain financial thresholds, as well as amounts related to carbon offsets and renewable energy credits or certificates, if material. Under the rules as originally issued, disclosure requirements begin phasing in for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. However, on April 4, 2024, the SEC determined to voluntarily stay the final rules pending certain legal challenges. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new rules and continue to monitor the status of the related legal challenges.\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance expanding disclosure requirements related to certain income statement expenses. The amendments require tabular disclosure of certain operating expenses disaggregated into categories, such as purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization. The amendments are effective for our fiscal year ending October 1, 2028, and may be applied retrospectively. While we are still evaluating the specific impacts and adoption method, we anticipate this guidance will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## Note 2:    Acquisitions, Div estitures, and Strategic Alliance\n\n## Fiscal 2023\n\nOn January 13, 2023, we sold the assets, primarily consisting of intellectual properties associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand, to Nestl\u00e9 for $110.0 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax  gain of $91.3 million, which was included in gain from sale of assets on our consolidated statement of earnings for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023. Results from Seattle's Best Coffee operations prior to the sale are reported in our Channel Development operating segment.\n\n## Fiscal 2022\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our Evolution Fresh brand and business to Bolthouse Farms. This transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 3:    Deriv ativ e Financial Instruments\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. We enter into interest rate swap agreements, including forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks, settled in cash based upon the difference between an agreed-upon benchmark rate and the prevailing benchmark rate at settlement. These agreements are generally settled around the time of the pricing of the related debt. Each derivative agreement's gain or loss is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt.\n\nTo hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Competition\n\nOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, virtual assistants, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure, tools and services relating to artificial intelligence, and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, communications, and other electronic devices and services; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats; and (10) providers of virtual or inperson healthcare services. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers' ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth's most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 1,556,000 fulltime and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for personnel across other parts of our business.\n\nWe strive to be Earth's best employer. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement this objective and invent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (education funding for eligible employees). Over 240,000 Amazon employees around the world have participated in Career Choice. We also continue to inspect and refine the mechanisms we use to hire, develop, evaluate, and retain our employees. In addition, safety is integral to everything we do at Amazon and we continue to invest in safety improvements such as capital improvements, new safety technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineering ergonomic solutions. Our safety team is dedicated to using the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.",

In addition, decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Operations\n\n## We may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our Gigafactories, which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products.\n\nOur plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. We also produce several vehicle components at our Gigafactories, such as battery modules and packs and drive units, and manufacture energy storage products. If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, which may harm our business and operating results.\n\nFinally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured by us and by our suppliers are stored and recycled at our various facilities. Any mishandling of these products may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.\n\n## We face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions.\n\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable. Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., with additional manufacturing operations in China and Europe, create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements; enforceability of our contractual rights; trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or ex change controls; and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products. For example, we monitor tax legislation changes on a global basis, including changes arising as a result of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting. Such conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention, and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them effectively.\n\n## Our business may suffer if our products or features contain defects, fail to perform as expected or take longer than expected to become fully functional.\n\nIf our products contain design or manufacturing defects, whether relating to our software or hardware, that cause them not to perform as designed or intended or that require repair, or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD (Supervised) features take longer than expected to become enabled, are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services may be harmed, and we may experience delivery delays, product recalls, allegations of product liability, breach of warranty and related consumer protection claims and significant warranty and other expenses. While we are continuously working to develop and improve our products' capability and performance, there is no guarantee that any incremental changes in the specific software or equipment we deploy in our vehicles over time will not result in initial functional disparities from prior iterations or will perform as forecast in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers. We have performed, and continue to perform, extensive internal testing on our products and features, though, like the rest of the industry, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate certain aspects of their long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics, including exposure to or consequence of external attacks. While we attempt to identify and address or remedy defects we identify pre-production and sale, there may be latent defects that we may be unable to detect or control for in our products, and thereby address, prior to their sale to or installation for customers.",

MCD leases vehicles as a minor component of its broader leasing portfolio, which is dominated by real estate, suggesting that vehicle usage is not a core operational focus. TSLA, in contrast, produces and sells vehicles directly, generating automotive revenue from vehicle deliveries and related features, with revenue recognized upon delivery to customers.

          "chunk_text": "## LEASING\n\nThe Company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the Company leases the land and generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases the land and buildings). The Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability reflect the present value of the Company's estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using the rate implicit in each lease, if determinable, or a collateralized incremental borrowing rate considering the term of the lease and particular currency environment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, primarily related to leases of office equipment, are not included in the Lease right-or-use asset or Lease liability and continue to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Company has elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components in its lessee portfolio. To the extent that occupancy costs, such as site maintenance, are included in the asset and liability, the impact is immaterial and is generally limited to Company-owned and operated restaurant locations. For franchised locations, which represent the majority of the restaurant portfolio, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance are generally required to be paid by the franchisees as part of the franchise arrangement. In addition, the Company is the lessee under nonrestaurant related leases such as office buildings, vehicles and office equipment. These leases are not a material subset of the Company's lease portfolio.\n\n## CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE\n\nCapitalized software is stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which primarily ranges from 3 to 10 years. Customer facing software is typically amortized over a shorter useful life, while back office and Corporate systems may have a longer useful life. Capitalized software less accumulated amortization is recorded within M iscellaneous other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and was (in millions): 2024-$907; 2023-$836; 2022-$864.\n\nThe Company reviews capitalized software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable or if an indicator of impairment exists. Results for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflected the write-off of impaired software no longer in use of $72 million. The Company did not identify any indicators of material impairment of capitalized software for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022.\n\n## LONG-LIVED ASSETS\n\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing M cDonald's restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together in the U.S. at a field office lev el, and internationally , at a market lev el. The Company  manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurant's cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.\n\nLosses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Company's Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses are related to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered 'held for sale.\"\n\n## GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurants and other businesses, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual market) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of M cDonald's restaurants from franchisees or transactions in which the Company obtains a controlling interest in subsidiaries or affiliates. When purchasing restaurants from a franchisee, the Company generally uses a discounted cash flow methodology (Level 3 inputs within the valuation hierarchy), which determines the fair value of restaurants acquired based on their expected profitability and cash flows. During 2024, the Company acquired restaurants from franchisees (including 228 restaurants in Israel, which are presented within the International Developmental Licensed M arkets &amp; Corporate segment) in order to support key franchising initiatives. Total restaurant acquisitions for the year resulted in the Company recording approximately $150 million of net tangible assets, $270 million of identifiable intangible assets (primarily consisting of reacquired franchise rights) and $240 million of goodwill. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on the amount of recorded revenues or net income of the Company. If a Company-owned and operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a Company-owned and operated restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit.\n\nThe following table presents the 2024 activity in goodwill by segment:\n\n",

We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for ex pected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\n\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer's lender when we arrange the financing are recognized upfront as an offset against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are ex pensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n\nWe offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under these programs, we originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606.",

Starbucks shows a declining trend in short-term investments, decreasing from $401.5 million in 2023 to $257.0 million in 2024, suggesting a potential reallocation of liquidity toward operational needs or debt reduction.

      "answer": "Lowe's (LOW) highlights that sustainability regulations, including those related to climate change and energy consumption, could increase compliance and merchandise costs, directly affecting profitability. Nike (NKE) notes that climate change and related sustainability regulations may require increased investments in facilities, affect raw material availability and cost, and increase transparency and reporting obligations. Starbucks (SBUX) indicates that ongoing government regulatory reform in areas such as sustainability and climate change responses in international markets like China could significantly increase compliance costs. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies face exposure to sustainability regulations, Lowe\u2019s focuses on cost implications, Nike emphasizes supply chain and transparency impacts, and Starbucks underscores regulatory uncertainty in key international markets.",

      "answer": "AMZN discloses that it leases vehicles as part of its fulfillment and logistics operations, with significant lease assets and liabilities indicating a reliance on vehicle fleets to support its delivery and logistics infrastructure. GM highlights its fleet vehicle sales, particularly to commercial and rental customers, noting that these sales make up a significant portion of its total vehicle sales but are generally less profitable than retail sales. MCD mentions that it leases vehicles as part of its non-restaurant-related lease portfolio, though this is not a material subset of its overall leasing activities, suggesting a more peripheral use of vehicles compared to AMZN and GM. Together, these disclosures show that while all three companies engage with vehicles, their strategic roles differ: AMZN relies on vehicles for core logistics, GM sells vehicles to fleet customers as part of its automotive business, and MCD uses vehicles peripherally in support functions.",

          "chunk_text": "## LEASING\n\nThe Company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the Company leases the land and generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases the land and buildings). The Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability reflect the present value of the Company's estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using the rate implicit in each lease, if determinable, or a collateralized incremental borrowing rate considering the term of the lease and particular currency environment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, primarily related to leases of office equipment, are not included in the Lease right-or-use asset or Lease liability and continue to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Company has elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components in its lessee portfolio. To the extent that occupancy costs, such as site maintenance, are included in the asset and liability, the impact is immaterial and is generally limited to Company-owned and operated restaurant locations. For franchised locations, which represent the majority of the restaurant portfolio, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance are generally required to be paid by the franchisees as part of the franchise arrangement. In addition, the Company is the lessee under nonrestaurant related leases such as office buildings, vehicles and office equipment. These leases are not a material subset of the Company's lease portfolio.\n\n## CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE\n\nCapitalized software is stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which primarily ranges from 3 to 10 years. Customer facing software is typically amortized over a shorter useful life, while back office and Corporate systems may have a longer useful life. Capitalized software less accumulated amortization is recorded within M iscellaneous other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and was (in millions): 2024-$907; 2023-$836; 2022-$864.\n\nThe Company reviews capitalized software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable or if an indicator of impairment exists. Results for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflected the write-off of impaired software no longer in use of $72 million. The Company did not identify any indicators of material impairment of capitalized software for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022.\n\n## LONG-LIVED ASSETS\n\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing M cDonald's restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together in the U.S. at a field office lev el, and internationally , at a market lev el. The Company  manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurant's cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.\n\nLosses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Company's Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses are related to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered 'held for sale.\"\n\n## GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurants and other businesses, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual market) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of M cDonald's restaurants from franchisees or transactions in which the Company obtains a controlling interest in subsidiaries or affiliates. When purchasing restaurants from a franchisee, the Company generally uses a discounted cash flow methodology (Level 3 inputs within the valuation hierarchy), which determines the fair value of restaurants acquired based on their expected profitability and cash flows. During 2024, the Company acquired restaurants from franchisees (including 228 restaurants in Israel, which are presented within the International Developmental Licensed M arkets &amp; Corporate segment) in order to support key franchising initiatives. Total restaurant acquisitions for the year resulted in the Company recording approximately $150 million of net tangible assets, $270 million of identifiable intangible assets (primarily consisting of reacquired franchise rights) and $240 million of goodwill. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on the amount of recorded revenues or net income of the Company. If a Company-owned and operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a Company-owned and operated restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit.\n\nThe following table presents the 2024 activity in goodwill by segment:\n\n",

We also provide tool and equipment rentals at over 1,400 locations across the U.S. and Canada, providing value and convenience for both Pros and consumers. To improve the customer experience and continue to grow this differentiated service offering, we are continuing to invest in more locations, more tools, and better technology.\n\nSourcing and Quality Assurance. We maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innovative products directly from manufacturers in the U.S. and around the world. During fiscal 2021, in addition to our U.S. sourcing operations, we maintained sourcing offices in Mexico, Canada, China, India, Vietnam and Europe. To ensure that suppliers adhere to our high standards of social and environmental responsibility, we also have a global responsible sourcing program. Under our supplier contracts, our suppliers are obligated to ensure that their products comply with applicable international, federal, state and local laws. These contracts also require compliance with our responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, health and safety, environment, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. To drive accountability with our suppliers, our standard supplier buying agreement includes a factory audit right related to these standards, and we conduct factory audits and compliance visits with our suppliers of private branded and direct import products. Our 2021 Responsible Sourcing Report, available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility/sourcing-responsibility, provides more information about this program. In addition, we have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to establishing criteria and overseeing compliance with safety, quality and performance standards for our private branded products.\n\nIntellectual Property. Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, ecommerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business, including our proprietary brands such as HDX , Husky , Hampton Bay , Home Decorators Collection , Glacier Bay , Vigoro , Everbilt and Lifeproof . The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nWe also maintain patent portfolios relating to our business operations, retail services and products and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our business. Patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential to our business. We continuously assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within The Home Depot's portfolio of proprietary and exclusive brands.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nOur industry is highly competitive, very fragmented, and evolving. As a result, we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer bases, and service providers, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online. These competitors include a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO distributors, home d\u00e9cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. The internet facilitates competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the level of competition we face.\n\nWe compete primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, product availability and assortment, and delivery options, both in-store and online. We also compete based on store location and appearance, presentation of merchandise, and ease of shopping experience. Furthermore, with respect to delivery options, customers are increasingly seeking faster and/or guaranteed delivery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or convenient pickup options, including curbside pickup. Our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including the success of our supply chain investments, described more fully under 'Our Supply Chain' below.\n\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences.

Whenever possible, we purchase directly from manufacturers to provide savings for customers and improve our gross margin.\n\nTo efficiently move products from our vendors to our stores and maintain in-stock levels, we own and operate distribution facilities that enable products to be received from vendors, stored and picked, or cross-docked, and then shipped to our retail locations or directly to customers. These facilities include 15 regional distribution centers (RDC) and 15 flatbed distribution centers (FDC) in the United States. The FDCs distribute merchandise that requires special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber, boards, panel products, pipe, siding, ladders, and building materials. On average, each RDC and FDC serves approximately 115 stores. We also own and operate seven distribution centers, including four lumber yards, to serve our Canadian market.\n\nIn addition to the RDCs and FDCs, we also operate coastal holding and transload facilities (CHF) to handle import product, bulk distribution centers (BDC) to handle appliances and other big and bulky product, cross-dock delivery terminals (XDT) to fulfill final mile box truck deliveries, and fulfillment centers (FC) focused on parcel post eligible products. As part of our market-based delivery model, we added three XDT ecosystems (consisting of six new XDTs) in fiscal 2021. We also enhanced our distribution network by opening four BDCs, three FCs, and two CHFs.\n\nCollectively, our facilities enable our import and e-commerce products to get to their destination as efficiently as possible. Most parcel-eligible items can be ordered by a customer and delivered within two business days at standard shipping rates.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, approximately 65% of the total dollar amount of merchandise we purchased flowed through our distribution network, while the remaining portion was shipped directly to our stores or customers directly from our vendors.",

Our returns for 2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.\n\nGiven the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time.\n\n## Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York\n\nWe have an operating lease arrangement through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility.\n\nUnder this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, it may result in our incurring financial liabilities in the form of 'program payments' which would not be expected to have a material adverse effect to our financial operations, the termination of our lease at G igafactory New York, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations.\n\nIn 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. As of December 31, 2024, we have met and expect to meet the requirements under this arrangement, as may be modified and discussed from time to time, based on our current and anticipated level of operations.\n\n## Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China\n\nWe have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we have been constructing Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures by the end of 2023, which was achieved in 2023, and to generate RMB 2.23 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had met and expect to meet the tax revenue requirements based on our current level of spend and sales.",

      "answer": "GM utilizes interest rate swaps both as fair value hedges and cash flow hedges, with changes in fair value impacting Automotive interest expense and GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. These swaps are used to hedge fixed-rate debt and forecasted transactions, with regression analysis ensuring hedge effectiveness. Lowe\u2019s accounts for its fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps using the shortcut method, assuming perfect effectiveness, and settled forward interest rate swaps totaling $4.8 billion in notional value over recent years, receiving $247 million, $143 million, and $136 million in respective transactions. Starbucks uses interest rate swaps primarily as cash flow hedges to manage variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates, with gains or losses recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) and reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt. Together, these strategies show GM focuses on both debt and transaction hedging, Lowe\u2019s emphasizes efficiency through shortcut accounting, and Starbucks prioritizes cash flow stability through forward-looking hedges.",

The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The changes in both the fair value of the hedged debt and the hedging instrument are recorded in Automotive interest expense.

The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2024. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued guidance expanding segment disclosure requirements. The amendments require enhanced disclosure for certain segment items and disclosure on how management uses reported measures to assess segment performance. The amendments do not change how segments are determined, aggregated, or how thresholds are applied to determine reportable segments. We expect to adopt the guidance for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2025. We are currently evaluating the expanded disclosure requirements and do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance expanding disclosure requirements related to income taxes. The amendments require enhanced jurisdictional disclosures for the income tax rate reconciliation and related to cash income tax es paid. Additionally, certain disclosures related to unrecognized tax  benefits and indefinite reinvestment assertions were removed. The amendments are effective for our fiscal year ending September 27, 2026. While we are still evaluating the specific impacts and timing of adoption, we anticipate this guidance will have a significant impact on our annual income tax disclosures.\n\nIn March 2024, the SEC issued its final climate disclosure rules, which require the disclosure of climate-related information in annual reports and registration statements. The rules require disclosure in the audited financial statements of certain effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions above certain financial thresholds, as well as amounts related to carbon offsets and renewable energy credits or certificates, if material. Under the rules as originally issued, disclosure requirements begin phasing in for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. However, on April 4, 2024, the SEC determined to voluntarily stay the final rules pending certain legal challenges. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new rules and continue to monitor the status of the related legal challenges.\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance expanding disclosure requirements related to certain income statement expenses. The amendments require tabular disclosure of certain operating expenses disaggregated into categories, such as purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization. The amendments are effective for our fiscal year ending October 1, 2028, and may be applied retrospectively. While we are still evaluating the specific impacts and adoption method, we anticipate this guidance will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## Note 2:    Acquisitions, Div estitures, and Strategic Alliance\n\n## Fiscal 2023\n\nOn January 13, 2023, we sold the assets, primarily consisting of intellectual properties associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand, to Nestl\u00e9 for $110.0 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax  gain of $91.3 million, which was included in gain from sale of assets on our consolidated statement of earnings for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023. Results from Seattle's Best Coffee operations prior to the sale are reported in our Channel Development operating segment.\n\n## Fiscal 2022\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our Evolution Fresh brand and business to Bolthouse Farms. This transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 3:    Deriv ativ e Financial Instruments\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. We enter into interest rate swap agreements, including forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks, settled in cash based upon the difference between an agreed-upon benchmark rate and the prevailing benchmark rate at settlement. These agreements are generally settled around the time of the pricing of the related debt. Each derivative agreement's gain or loss is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt.\n\nTo hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges.

      "answer": "Home Depot (HD) highlights its compliance with domestic and foreign labor laws, including wage and hour regulations, minimum wage requirements, and potential cost impacts from significant wage increases. Nike (NKE) emphasizes its dependence on international manufacturing and notes exposure to labor disruptions, including risks related to unionization, collective bargaining, and labor strikes in countries where it operates. Starbucks (SBUX) discusses the complexity and increased costs of navigating local labor laws across 87 international markets, including challenges in employee retention, negotiation, and compliance with region-specific employment regulations. While all three companies face labor law risks, HD focuses on cost exposure from regulatory changes, NKE on supply chain labor disruptions, and SBUX on international compliance complexity, revealing distinct operational and financial sensitivities tied to their global footprints and labor dependencies.",

The company also mentions the risk of labor organization growth and potential strikes or work stoppages.",
        "Hop 2: NKE \u2192 Labor Laws: NKE highlights its reliance on international footwear contract manufacturers and notes the risk of labor strikes or disruptions due to unionization and labor law changes, which could impact product availability and increase operating costs. It also notes the challenge of replacing specialized manufacturers if they go out of business.",

It also notes the risk of labor strikes due to geopolitical instability and social unrest affecting its operations."

In general, these awards vest ratably over a three-year period from the date of grant.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nprimarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(59.6) billion and $(58.2) billion in 2020 and 2021, with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $35.0 billion, and $55.4 billion in 2020 and 2021, which primarily reflect investments in additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), which investments we expect to continue over time. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion in 2020 and 2021.\n\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(1.1) billion and $6.3 billion in 2020 and 2021. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $17.3 billion and $27.0 billion in 2020 and 2021. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $18.4 billion and $20.7 billion in 2020 and 2021. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $11.6 billion and $7.1 billion in 2020 and 2021, reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS.\n\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility, $725 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs, and $803 million of borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility (the 'Credit Facility') as of December 31, 2021. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 - Debt' for additional information.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $7.6 billion. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\n\nTax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2019 and a partial election for 2020 and 2021. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $1.7 billion and $3.7 billion for 2020 and 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which will delay the deductibility of these expenses and potentially increase the amount of cash taxes we pay.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $257 million and $260 million. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 - Debt' and 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies' for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.\n\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, 'Risk Factors.' We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. We expect to fund the acquisition of MGM Holdings Inc. with cash on hand.\n\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.",

In December 2019, the French tax authorities issued an additional assessment of 70 million Euros ($80 million), including interest and penalties, for the 2013 year asserting that Booking.com had taxable income attributable to a permanent establishment in France. The French tax authorities also have issued assessments totaling 39 million Euros ($45 million), including interest and penalties, for certain tax years between 2011 and 2015 on Booking.com's French subsidiary asserting that the subsidiary did not receive sufficient compensation for the services it rendered to Booking.com in the Netherlands. In December 2021, the French tax authorities issued assessments on Booking.com's French subsidiary totaling 78 million Euros ($88 million), including interest and penalties, for the tax years 2016 through 2018 again asserting that the subsidiary did not receive sufficient compensation for the services it rendered to Booking.com. As a result of a formal demand from the French tax authorities for payment of the amounts assessed against Booking.com for the years 2006 through 2012, in January 2019, we paid the assessments of approximately 356 million Euros ($403 million) in order to preserve our right to contest those assessments in court. The payment, which is included in \"Other assets, net\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020, does not constitute an admission that we owe the taxes and will be refunded (with interest) to us to the extent we prevail. In December 2019 and October 2020, we initiated court proceedings with respect to certain of the assessments. Although we believe that Booking.com has been, and continues to be, in compliance with French tax law, and we are contesting the assessments, during the three months ended September 30, 2020, we contacted the French tax authorities regarding the potential to achieve resolution of the matter through a settlement. After assessing several potential outcomes and potential settlement amounts and terms, an unrecognized tax benefit in the amount of 50 million Euros ($59 million) was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020, of which the majority was included as a partial reduction to the tax payment recorded in \"Other assets, net\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020. In December 2020, the French Administrative Court (Conseil d'Etat) delivered a decision in the \"ValueClick\" case that could have an impact on the outcome in our case. After considering the potential adverse impact of the new decision on the potential outcomes for the Booking.com assessments, we currently estimate that the reasonably possible loss related to VAT is approximately 20 million Euros ($22 million). For additional information related to the French and other tax assessments, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \" We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. \"\n\nBeginning in 2014, Booking.com received several letters from the Netherlands Pension Fund for the Travel Industry (Reiswerk) (\"BPF\") claiming that Booking.com is required to participate in the mandatory pension scheme of the BPF with retroactive effect to 1999, which has a higher contribution rate than the pension scheme in which Booking.com is currently participating. BPF instituted legal proceedings against Booking.com and in 2016 the District Court of Amsterdam rejected all of BPF's claims. BPF appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal, and, in May 2019, the Court of Appeal also rejected all of BPF's claims, in each case by ruling that Booking.com does not meet the definition of a travel intermediary for purposes of the mandatory pension scheme. BPF then appealed to the Netherlands Supreme Court. In April 2021, the Supreme Court overturned the previous decision of the Court of Appeal and held that Booking.com meets the definition of a travel intermediary for the purposes of the mandatory pension scheme. The Supreme Court ruled only on the qualification of Booking.com as a travel intermediary for the purposes of the mandatory pension scheme, and did not rule on the various other defenses we brought forward against BPF's claims. The Supreme Court referred the matter to another Court of Appeal that will have to assess the other defenses we brought forward if BPF were to proceed with the litigation. We intend to pursue a number of defenses in any subsequent proceedings and may ultimately prevail in whole or in part. While we continue to believe that Booking.com is in compliance with its pension obligations and that the Court of Appeal could ultimately rule in favor of Booking.com, given the Supreme Court's decision, we believe it is probable that we have incurred a loss related to this matter. We are not able to reasonably estimate a loss or a range of loss because there are significant factual and legal questions yet to be determined in any subsequent proceedings. As a result, as of December 31, 2021, we have not recorded a liability in connection with a potential adverse ultimate outcome to this litigation. However, if Booking.com were to ultimately lose and all of BPF's claims were to be accepted (including with retroactive effect to 1999), we estimate that as of December 31, 2021, the maximum loss, not including any potential interest or penalties, would be approximately 289 million Euros ($328 million). Such estimated potential loss increases as Booking.com continues not to contribute to the BPF and depends on Booking.com's applicable",

We had 1.5 billion and 1.4 billion shares of common stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nCommon Stock Holders of our common stock are entitled to dividends at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Dividends were not declared or paid on our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our dividends declared per common share were  $0.38  and  $1.52  and  our  total  dividends  paid  on  common  stock  were  $545  million  and  $2.2  billion  for  the  years  ended December  31,  2020  and  2019.  Holders  of  common  stock  are  entitled  to  one  vote  per  share  on  all  matters  submitted  to  our stockholders  for  a  vote.  The  liquidation  rights  of  holders  of  our  common  stock  are  secondary  to  the  payment  or  provision  for payment of all our debts and liabilities and to holders of our preferred stock, if any such shares are then outstanding.\n\nWe did not purchase any shares of our outstanding common stock in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019. We purchased three million shares of our outstanding common stock for $90 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Shares repurchased were part of the common stock repurchase program announced in March 2015, which our Board of Directors increased and extended in January 2016 and January 2017.\n\nCruise Preferred Shares In 2021, Cruise Holdings issued $2.7 billion of Cruise Class G Preferred Shares to Microsoft, Walmart and other investors, including $1.0 billion to General Motors Holdings LLC. All proceeds related to the Cruise Class G Preferred Shares are designated exclusively for working capital and general corporate purposes of Cruise Holdings. In addition, we, Cruise Holdings and Microsoft entered into a long-term strategic relationship to accelerate the commercialization of self-driving vehicles with Microsoft being the preferred public cloud provider.\n\nThe Cruise Class G Preferred Shares participate pari passu with holders of Cruise Holdings common stock and Class F Preferred Shares (Cruise Class F Preferred Shares) in any dividends declared. Each Cruise Class G Preferred Share is entitled to one vote per Cruise Class G Preferred Share on all matters submitted for vote by or consent of the Cruise Holdings members. The holders of Cruise Class G Preferred Shares are restricted from transferring the Cruise Class G Preferred Shares for four years, without the written consent of both us and Cruise Holdings' Board of Directors. The Cruise Class G Preferred Shares convert into the class of shares to be issued to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) at specified exchange ratios. No covenants or other events of default exist that can trigger redemption of the Cruise Class G Preferred Shares. The Cruise Class G Preferred Shares are entitled to receive the greater of their carrying value or a pro-rata share of any proceeds or distributions upon the occurrence of a merger, sale, liquidation or dissolution of Cruise Holdings, and are classified as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nConsistent with the Cruise Class G Preferred Shares, the Class A-1 Preferred Shares issued to SoftBank in 2018 (Cruise Class A-1 Preferred  Shares)  and  Cruise  Class  F  Preferred  Shares  convert  into  the  class  of  shares  to  be  issued  to  the  public  in  an  IPO  at specified exchange ratios.

For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer cobranded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.\n\n## We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile\n\nWe have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as:\n\n- changes in interest rates;\n- conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in;\n- quarterly variations in operating results;\n- fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internet-related companies in particular;\n- changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels;\n- changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n- changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;\n- changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and\n- transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, social media activity, and speculation.\n\nVolatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business\n\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, satellite communications services, healthcare, and other products and services that we offer or sell.

We also compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we inv est significant resources in training and motiv ating them to maintain a high lev el of job satisfaction. These positions often hav e high turnov er rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitiv e labor market. We hav e faced and may continue to face additional challenges in recruiting and retaining associates due to wage pressure; flexible scheduling needs; health and safety concerns; and challenges related to a remote or hybrid working environment for associates who work in our store support centers.

CYBERSECURITY\n\n## Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, ex tortion, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws.\n\nIdentifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity risks related to our business, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach including third party assessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews. To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we, among other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration testing using external third-party tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability reporting, conduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including our consumer products) and implement appropriate changes.\n\nWe have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected stages: 1) preparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and recovery, and 4) post-incident analysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity.\n\nSecurity events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents are evaluated to determine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact.\n\nWe also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals then collaborate with technical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form detection, mitigation and remediation strategies.\n\nAs part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and compliance with applicable practices and standards. As of 2024, our Information Security Management System has been certified to conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.\n\nOur risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third parties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service providers. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated when determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers and potential fourth-party risks when handling and/or processing our employee, business or customer data. In addition to new vendor onboarding, we perform risk management during third-party cybersecurity compromise incidents to identify and mitigate risks to us from third-party incidents.\n\nWe describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the heading 'Our information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences' included as part of our risk factor disclosures at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Cybersecurity Governance\n\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. Our Audit Committee is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. Members of the Audit Committee receive updates on a quarterly basis from senior management, including leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity. This includes existing and new cybersecurity risks, status on how management is addressing and/or mitigating those risks, cybersecurity and data privacy incidents (if any) and status on key information security initiatives. Our Board members also engage in ad hoc conversations with management on cybersecurity-related news events and discuss any updates to our cybersecurity risk management and strategy programs.",

      "answer": "GM utilizes interest rate swap agreements as both fair value hedges and cash flow hedges to manage interest rate risk on fixed-rate and forecasted debt, with changes in fair value affecting Automotive interest expense or Accumulated other comprehensive loss. HD uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its fixed/floating-rate debt portfolio, with $6.0 billion in floating-rate debt principal as of February 2, 2025, and a one percentage point increase in interest rates expected to raise annual interest expense by $60 million. LOW accounts for its fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps using the shortcut method, assuming perfect effectiveness, and settled forward interest rate swaps totaling $4.8 billion in recent note issuances, receiving payments totaling $526 million. These strategies reveal that GM emphasizes both short-term and long-term hedging, HD focuses on maintaining a floating-rate exposure buffer, and LOW prioritizes simplification and cost recovery through forward swaps.",

        "Hop 3: LOW \u2192 Interest Rate Swap Agreements: LOW uses the shortcut method for fair value hedges and settled $4.8 billion in forward swaps during recent debt issuances, receiving $526 million in total payments, indicating a strategy of locking in favorable rates ahead of financing activities."

When a fair value hedge is de-designated, or when the derivative is terminated prior to maturity, the fair value adjustment to the hedged debt continues to be reported as part of the carrying value of the debt and is recognized in Automotive interest expense over its remaining life.\n\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial G M  Financial  utilizes  interest  rate  derivative  instruments  to  manage  interest  rate  risk  and  foreign  currency  derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk.  The change in fair value of the derivative instruments not designated as an accounting hedge is recorded in  GM Financial interest, operating and other ex penses.\n\nCertain interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as fair value hedges. The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate or the risk of changes in fair value attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the swap has been designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. The change in fair value of the related hedge is also recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nCertain interest rate swap and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges. The risk being hedged is the interest rate and foreign currency risk related to forecasted transactions. If the contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the cash flow hedge is deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is recognized in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses along with the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded currently in earnings and are presented in the same income statement line as the earnings effect of the hedged item.\n\n## Note 3.

During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill due to the use of preliminary information in our initial estimates. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n\n## MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES\n\nWe value the majority of our inv entory under the retail inv entory method, with the remainder of our inv entories v alued under a cost method, primarily the first-in, first-out method. Under the retail inv entory method, inv entories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail v alue of inv entories.\n\nThe retail v alue of our inv entory is adjusted as needed to reflect current market conditions. Because these adjustments are based on current prev ailing market conditions, the v alue of our inv entory approximates the lower of cost or market. The v aluation under the retail inv entory method is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inv entory losses (or shrink). As such, there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inv entory cost and gross profit. We determine markups and markdowns based on the consideration of a v ariety of factors such as current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and buying trends, age of the merchandise, and weather conditions.\n\nWe calculate shrink based on actual inv entory losses identified as a result of physical inv entory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inv entory losses occurring between physical inv entory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inv entory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. A 10% increase in the shrink rate used to estimate our inv entory shrink reserv e would hav e increased cost of sales by approximately $95 million for fiscal 2024. Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inv entory losses has not been material to our annual financial results.\n\nWe do not believ e there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to v alue our inv entory under the retail inv entory method. We believ e that the retail inv entory method prov ides an inv entory v aluation which approximates cost and results in v aluing our inv entory at the lower of cost or market.\n\n## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nFor information on our accounting policies and on accounting pronouncements that hav e impacted or may materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Item 7A . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures A bout Market Risk.\n\n## INTEREST RATE RISK\n\nWe have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our long-term debt portfolio. We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed/floating-rate debt portfolio, none of which are for trading or speculativ e purposes. At February 2, 2025, after giv ing consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, floating-rate debt principal was $6.0 billion, or approximately 12% of our senior notes portfolio. Our interest rate swap agreements were in an aggregate liability position of $795 million at February 2, 2025. The changes in the fair v alues of our interest rate swap agreements offset the changes in the fair v alue of the hedged long-term debt. Based on our February 2, 2025 floating-rate debt principal, a one percentage point increase in the interest rate of floating-rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $60 million.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK\n\nWe are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. We use deriv ativ e instruments to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk, none of which are for trading or speculativ e purposes. Our foreign currency related hedging arrangements outstanding at the end of fiscal 2024 were not material.",

      "answer": "HD explicitly states that there are no incentive stock options currently outstanding under its plans, indicating a shift away from this form of equity compensation. NKE, on the other hand, includes incentive stock options as part of its Stock Incentive Plan and grants them with vesting typically over four years, with options expiring 10 years after the grant date. SBUX maintains equity incentive plans that allow for incentive stock options, though it notes that stock options have not been broadly used in recent years, with a greater focus on RSUs and performance-based awards. Each company uses the fair market value at the grant date for valuation, with NKE and SBUX employing models like Black-Scholes-Merton, while HD focuses on the Black-Scholes model for its nonqualified options. This reveals differing strategic emphases on incentive stock options across the three firms, with NKE maintaining active use, SBUX de-emphasizing them, and HD having phased them out entirely.",

See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type, and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily include expenses related to raw materials, purchased goods, packaging, and delivery, along with operational costs of our supply chain organization. This encompasses wages, benefits, occupancy costs, and depreciation associated with sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Additionally, it includes costs related to inventory and supply chain asset impairments.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions, and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees, and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the vesting period.

The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at $100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0 billion thereafter (based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been achieved for the four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial statements filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K.

Tesla offers installation services related to its energy storage and solar products, positioning them as integral to the customer experience for its sustainable energy solutions. While all three companies provide installation services, the strategic emphasis and scope differ significantly: The Home Depot treats them as complementary, Lowe's is scaling them as a strategic growth lever, and Tesla integrates them tightly with product deployment to support its mission-driven goals.",

As of January 31, 2025, Lowe's operated 1,748 home improvement stores and outlets in the United States, representing approximately 195 million square feet of retail selling space. \u00ae\n\nLowe's was founded in 1921 with the opening of its first hardware store in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina. The Company was incorporated in North Carolina in 1952 and has been publicly held since 1961. The Company's common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange - ticker symbol 'LOW'.\n\nFor additional information about the Company's performance and financial condition, see Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations', of this Annual Report.\n\n## Our Strategy\n\nLowe's is an omnichannel retailer whose focus is on helping customers solve problems and fulfill dreams for their homes by providing an excellent customer experience, creating a great place to work for our associates, and improving our communities, which we believe will create long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders. In fiscal 2024, we continued to execute on our Total Home strategy that was introduced in fiscal 2020, by focusing on serving the professional customer (Pro customer), accelerating our online business, expanding installation services, improving localization efforts and elevating our product assortment. In December 2024, we updated our Total Home strategy, aligned with the key drivers of home improvement demand, to help our customers solve their home improvement needs with more value and exceptional service. The five pillars of our Total Home strategy are as follows:\n\nDrive Pro penetration\n\nAccelerate online sales\n\nExpand home services\n\nCreate a loyalty ecosystem\n\nIncrease space productivity\n\n- We continue to transform our Pro offerings to drive Pro penetration by continuing to enhance our Pro product assortment, investing in inventory of highvolume Pro products, launching our redesigned loyalty program, improving job site delivery capabilities, and rolling out our new Pro extended aisle.\n- We are investing in our omnichannel retail capabilities to accelerate our online business through project design tools and our online product marketplace.\n- We are expanding our installation services to create a high value simplified installation solution, which are provided by our network of independent installers or outsourced to our third-party model that sells, furnishes, and installs both smaller refresh projects and more complex projects.\n- We are creating a loyalty ecosystem that drives brand preference and includes building out our MyLowe's Rewards infrastructure for both Pro and do-ityourself (DIY) customers.\n- Finally, we are increasing space productivity by optimizing our assortments and tailoring them to the local markets, and balancing our value-oriented private brands with our national brands.\n\n## Our Customers and Market\n\nThe home improvement market in which we operate is highly fragmented, serving Pro customers, individual homeowners, and renters completing a wide array of projects that vary along the spectrum of DIY and do-it-for-me (DIFM). The Pro customer at Lowe's is primarily the small to medium sized Pro, which includes three broad categories: tradespeople, repair and remodelers, and property managers.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further discussion of our products and services, technology and competitive strengths, refer to Item 1- Business. For discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2023-related items, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 29, 2024.\n\n## Overview and 2024 Highlights\n\nOur mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on AI, robotics and automation.\n\nIn 2024, we produced approximately 1,773,000 consumer vehicles and delivered approximately 1,789,000 consumer vehicles. We are focused on profitable growth, including by leveraging existing factories and production lines to introduce new and more affordable products, further improving and deploying our FSD (Supervised) capabilities, including future autonomous capabilities through our purpose-built Robotaxi product, Cybercab, reducing costs, increasing vehicle production, utilized capacity and delivery capabilities, improving and developing our vehicles and battery technologies, vertically integrating and localizing our supply chain, and expanding our global infrastructure, including our service and charging infrastructure.\n\nIn 2024, we deployed 31.4 GWh of energy storage products. We are focused on ramping the production and increasing the market penetration of our energy storage products.\n\nIn 2024, we recognized total revenues of $97.69 billion, representing an increase of $917 million compared to the prior year. In 2024, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $7.09 billion, representing a decrease of $7.91 billion compared to the prior year, primarily due to the impact of releasing $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance associated with U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2023.We continue to ramp production and build and optimize our manufacturing capacity, expand our operations while focusing on further cost reductions and operational efficiencies to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products, and invest in research and development to accelerate our AI, software, and fleet-based profits for further revenue growth.\n\nWe ended 2024 with $36.56 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $7.47 billion from the end of 2023. Our cash flows provided by operating activities were $14.92 billion in 2024 compared to $13.26 billion in 2023, representing an increase of $1.67 billion. Capital ex penditures amounted to $11.34 billion in 2024 compared to $8.90 billion in 2023, representing an increase of $2.44 billion. Overall growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects and research and development in upcoming periods.",

      "question": "How do LOW, NKE, and SBUX each apply the Black-Scholes option pricing model in their financial disclosures, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to valuing equity-based compensation or financial instruments?",
      "answer": "LOW uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees, incorporating historical and implied volatility, U.S. Treasury yields, and expected option terms based on historical exercise patterns. NKE applies the Black-Scholes model specifically to value options, stock appreciation rights, and employees' purchase rights under ESPPs, with vesting periods typically spanning four years. SBUX, while not directly applying Black-Scholes to employee compensation, utilizes the model as part of Level 3 fair value estimation for private equity instruments and certain financial assets. This reveals that while all three companies rely on Black-Scholes for fair value estimation, they apply it in different contexts\u2014LOW and NKE for employee compensation and SBUX primarily for financial instruments and investments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LOW \u2192 Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model: LOW uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock options, incorporating historical and implied volatility, U.S. Treasury yields, and expected option terms based on historical exercise patterns, with vesting over three years.",
        "Hop 2: NKE \u2192 Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model: NKE applies the Black-Scholes model to value options, stock appreciation rights, and employees' purchase rights under ESPPs, with substantially all awards vesting ratably over four years.",
        "Hop 3: SBUX \u2192 Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model: SBUX uses the Black-Scholes model for determining the fair value of private equity instruments and Level 3 assets, which are unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of market participant assumptions."

      "answer": "HD defines ESPP in its glossary of terms, indicating its use of the plan but not disclosing specific structural details. LOW provides detailed mechanics of its ESPP, stating that the purchase price equals 85% of the closing price on the purchase date, with 0.7 million shares issued in 2023 and $21 million in share-based payment expense recognized that year. TSLA explains that its ESPP is accounted for using the fair value method, with a six-month offering period and stock-based compensation expense recognized on a straight-line basis, and notes that the ESPP is part of its broader stock-based compensation strategy that includes RSUs and stock options. Comparing these, HD takes a high-level definitional approach, LOW offers a structured and quantified ESPP with regular issuance and expense tracking, while TSLA integrates ESPP into a comprehensive equity compensation framework with performance-based elements.",

      "answer": "Amazon reports vehicles as part of its finance and operating leases, with $68.0 billion in gross assets under finance leases as of December 31, 2023, indicating a significant reliance on leased vehicles for logistics. Home Depot includes vehicles among its leased assets and evaluates long-lived assets, including vehicles, for impairment at the individual store level, though no material impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2023. Tesla generates cash inflows from vehicle sales, with $13.26 billion in operating cash flow during 2023, showing that vehicles are a core revenue driver rather than a leased operational asset. Together, these perspectives reveal how each company interacts with vehicles differently\u2014Amazon through leasing, Home Depot through asset management, and Tesla through direct production and sales.",

      "answer": "Home Depot (HD) lists its subsidiary information as Exhibit 21 with no additional reference or incorporation by reference, indicating a standalone presentation. Lowe\u2019s (LOW) includes its subsidiary list as Exhibit 21.1 but also marks it with a \u2021 symbol, suggesting it may be presented in a specific format or tied to other documentation, though no further details are provided. Tesla (TSLA) includes its subsidiary list as Exhibit 21.1 and explicitly marks it as 'Filed Herewith,' indicating it is directly included in the filing rather than incorporated by reference. These differences suggest varying levels of accessibility and integration of subsidiary data, which could impact how easily investors can assess corporate structure across these firms.",

      "question": "How do HD, MCD, and SBUX differ in the vesting schedules and financial implications of their stock option and RSU programs, particularly in terms of vesting timelines and unrecognized compensation costs?",
      "answer": "HD, MCD, and SBUX each structure their stock-based compensation programs differently. HD primarily uses nonqualified stock options that vest at a rate of 25% per year starting on the second anniversary of the grant, with potential acceleration upon reaching age 60 and five years of service. It also reports using the Black-Scholes model to estimate fair value for these options. MCD follows a more standard vesting pattern, with options becoming exercisable in four equal installments beginning one year from the grant date, and it reports $187 million in unrecognized compensation cost to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years. SBUX, on the other hand, focuses more heavily on RSUs, with $255 million in unrecognized compensation expense to be recognized over 2.3 years, and has not issued stock options in recent fiscal years. These differences suggest varying strategic emphases on stock-based compensation and different timelines for recognizing related expenses.",

Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n\n## MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES\n\nWe value the majority of our inv entory under the retail inv entory method, with the remainder of our inv entories v alued under a cost method, primarily the first-in, first-out method. Under the retail inv entory method, inv entories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail v alue of inv entories.\n\nThe retail v alue of our inv entory is adjusted as needed to reflect current market conditions. Because these adjustments are based on current prev ailing market conditions, the v alue of our inv entory approximates the lower of cost or market. The v aluation under the retail inv entory method is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inv entory losses (or shrink). As such, there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inv entory cost and gross profit. We determine markups and markdowns based on the consideration of a v ariety of factors such as current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and buying trends, age of the merchandise, and weather conditions.\n\nWe calculate shrink based on actual inv entory losses identified as a result of physical inv entory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inv entory losses occurring between physical inv entory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inv entory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. A 10% increase in the shrink rate used to estimate our inv entory shrink reserv e would hav e increased cost of sales by approximately $95 million for fiscal 2024. Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inv entory losses has not been material to our annual financial results.\n\nWe do not believ e there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to v alue our inv entory under the retail inv entory method.

We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed/floating-rate debt portfolio, none of which are for trading or speculativ e purposes. At February 2, 2025, after giv ing consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, floating-rate debt principal was $6.0 billion, or approximately 12% of our senior notes portfolio. Our interest rate swap agreements were in an aggregate liability position of $795 million at February 2, 2025. The changes in the fair v alues of our interest rate swap agreements offset the changes in the fair v alue of the hedged long-term debt. Based on our February 2, 2025 floating-rate debt principal, a one percentage point increase in the interest rate of floating-rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $60 million.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK\n\nWe are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThe overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer with support from the Financial Risk Council, which reviews and, where appropriate, approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks. The Financial Risk Council comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the Audit Committee and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee and Finance Committee assist and guide the Board of Directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies. A risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies, risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the Financial Risk Council. Our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from large adverse market movements on our key exposures.\n\nAutomotive The following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and commodity risk. Sensitivity  analysis  is  used  to  measure  the  potential  loss  in  the  fair  value  of  financial  instruments  with  ex posure  to  market  risk.  The  models  used  assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in ex change rates, interest rate yield curves and commodity prices. For options and other instruments with nonlinear returns, models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of market shifts. There are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot ex change rates and commodity prices change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency exposures and offsetting long-short positions in currency or other exposures, such as interest rates and commodity prices, which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We have foreign currency exposures related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations. At December 31, 2024, our most significant foreign currency exposures were between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan,  Korean won,  Mexican peso and  Brazilian real.  Derivative  instruments  such  as  foreign  currency  forwards,  swaps  and  options  are  primarily  used  to  hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues, costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 12 months at December 31, 2024.\n\nThe net fair value liability of financial instruments with ex posure to foreign currency risk was $0.2 billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. These amounts are calculated utilizing a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and other assets. The potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been $0.3 billion and insignificant at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into U.S. dollars as part of the consolidation  process.  Fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  ex change  rates  can  therefore  create  volatility  in  the  results  of  operations  and  may  adversely  affect  our financial condition.",

GM Financial primarily finances its loan, lease and commercial origination volume through the use of secured and unsecured credit facilities, securitization transactions and the issuance of unsecured debt in the capital markets.\n\nHuman Capital The foundation of GM's business is our Purpose: We pioneer the innovations that move and connect people to what matters. It is why we exist. Our Purpose, growth strategy and culture all help us on our path towards achieving our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. Our people are our most valuable asset, and we must continue to attract and retain the best talent in the world in order to achieve this vision. As a result, we strive to create a Workplace of Choice to attract, retain, motivate and develop top talent by adhering to a responsible employer philosophy, which includes, among other things, commitments to create job opportunities, pay workers fairly, ensure safety and well-being and foster an inclusive work environment in which all employees can perform at their best. Fundamental to these commitments are our company values.\n\nBuilding a Stronger Future Together Attracting and retaining talent to build great vehicles is critical to thriving in an increasingly competitive landscape. Our company initiatives for inclusivity are created to further our main business objective - to build and sell the best vehicles on the market to everyone, everywhere. Our current Board of Directors includes six women and seven men of different backgrounds who contribute their own unique perspective, industry insights, experiences and expertise.  We bring together best-in-class talent to innovate in an inclusive work environment, and our guiding principle is performance.  We have a talent management system that underscores our commitment to high standards. We extend outside of GM to reduce barriers and improve access to our products and services  by  aligning  to  G M's  focus  on  STEAM  education  and  road  safety.  This  includes  our  investments  in  communities  through  many  partnerships  and volunteerism.\n\nDevelop  and  Retain  T alented  People Today,  we  compete  for  talent  not  only  against  other  automotive  companies,  but  with  businesses  in  sectors  such  as technology. To win and retain that talent, we must encourage employee behaviors that align with our values, fulfill employees' long-term aspirations and provide experiences that make them feel valued, included and engaged. We have introduced various tools to outline expectations of our employees at each stage of our career ladder  in  terms  of  role  scope,  skills  and  behaviors. Along  with  providing  mentoring  and  networking  opportunities,  we  offer  a  vast  array  of  career  development resources to employees to make the most of their careers at GM. We have established curricula for each of our functional areas aimed at ensuring that our employees have the skills they need to perform their jobs. We also offer continuing education programs from leading colleges and universities. For example, the Technical Education  Program provides employees an opportunity to complete corporate strategically aligned degrees and certificate  programs.  Employees  in  some  of  our technical roles can participate in the GM Technical Learning University - a training and upskilling program designed to expand and update the technical abilities of our workforce.\n\nGM recognizes that leadership effectiveness is a critical business need. We continue to expand our leadership development programs, which are designed to deliver skills and behaviors for each level of leadership to effectively lead their teams. Focus areas range from delivering constructive feedback to effectively leading large scale change initiatives.\n\nSafety and Well-Being The safety and well-being of our employees is also a critical component of our ability to transform the future of personal mobility. At GM, we pride ourselves on our commitment to live values that return people home safely -",

Our installed sales model, which separates selling and project administration tasks, allows our sales associates to focus on project selling, while project managers ensure that the details related to installing the products are efficiently ex ecuted.  We are simplifying the process through a team of remote associates that we call our central selling team. This team handles building quotes, answering questions over video or phone call, and providing personalized support to our customers. We are also implementing technology that allows our customers to finalize their installation contract and checkout on lowes.com or mobile application, so they do not need to return to the store. Installed sales, which includes both product and labor, accounted for approximately 5% of total sales in fiscal 2024.\n\n## Lowe's Protection Plans and Repair Services\n\nWe offer extended protection plans for certain products within the Appliances, Kitchens &amp; Bath, D\u00e9cor, Millwork, Rough Plumbing, Electrical, Seasonal &amp; Outdoor Living, Tools, and Hardware categories. These protection plans provide customers with product protection that enhances the coverage offered by the manufacturer's warranty and provide additional benefits and repair services that extend beyond the manufacturer's warranty.\n\n## Seasonality and Working Capital\n\nThe home improvement business in general is subject to seasonal influences, particularly related to the spring selling season.  Historically, we have realized the highest volume of sales during our second fiscal quarter (May, June, and July) and the lowest volume of sales during our fourth fiscal quarter (November, December, and January).  Accordingly, our working capital requirements have historically been greater during our fourth fiscal quarter as we build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season and as we experience lower fourth fiscal quarter sales volumes.  We fund our working capital requirements primarily through cash flows generated from operations, but also with short-term borrowings, as needed.  For more detailed information, see the Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations', of this Annual Report.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nThe name 'Lowe's' is a registered service mark of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We consider this mark and logo and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition to be valuable to our business. This subsidiary owns and maintains various additional registered and unregistered trademarks, service marks and trade names, including private brand product names, such as, 'Kobalt', 'STAINMASTER', and 'allen+roth.' This subsidiary also maintains various Internet domain names that are important to our business, and we also own registered and unregistered copyrights. In addition, we maintain patent portfolios related to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect certain innovations that we incorporate into our products, services, or business operations.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe are subject to a wide array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations. We do not currently expect compliance with these laws and regulations to have a material effect on our capital ex penditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nWhen it comes to attracting and retaining top talent, Lowe's strives to be the employer of choice in retail. At Lowe's we are committed to creating valuable career opportunities for our associates, supporting them and the communities where they live, and cultivating a culture that invites and encourages diverse opinions and ideas. We would like our associates to see Lowe's as a 'Home to Possibility' with good jobs, a sense of belonging, and a promising future.\n\nAs a testament to our commitments, in fiscal 2024 we received several notable employer of choice awards, including being named on the Disability:IN National Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion, Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies Specialty Retailer, 2024 Great Place to Work Certified - U.S. and India, Fair360 Top 50 Noteworthy Company for Workplace Fairness, 2024 American Opportunity Index Top 100 Company, and a Best Corporation for Veteran's Business Enterprises of the Year.",

Business\n\n## General\n\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K ('10-K' or 'Report') for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2024 ('fiscal 2024'), Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as 'Starbucks,' the 'Company,' 'we,' 'us,' or 'our.'\n\nStarbucks is the premier roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, operating in 87 markets. Formed in 1985, Starbucks Corporation's common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market ('Nasdaq') under the symbol 'SBUX.' We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea, and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items through company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels, such as licensed stores as well as grocery and foodservice through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9 S.A. ('Nestl\u00e9'). In addition to our flagship Starbucks Coffee brand, we sell goods and services under the following brands: Teavana , Ethos , and Starbucks Reserve . \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nOur primary objective is to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. We believe the continuous investments in our brand and operations will deliver long-term targeted revenue and income growth. This includes expansion of our global store base, adding stores in both existing, developed markets such as the U.S. and in higher growth markets, as well as optimizing the mix of company-operated and licensed stores around the world. In addition, by leveraging experiences gained through our stores and elsewhere, we continue to drive beverage, equipment, process, and technology innovation, including in our industry-leading digital platform. We strive to regularly offer consumers new, innovative coffee and other products in a variety of forms, across new categories, diverse channels, and alternative store formats.\n\nStarbucks has always been a different kind of company - one deep with purpose, where we work together to create a positive impact in the world. With coffee at our core, we pursue ambitious goals for our partners (employees), our communities, and our planet, which we believe also contributes to the long-term sustainability of creating a thriving business powered by thriving people for a thriving planet and communities. Our work to uplift one another extends well beyond our partners to the communities where we do business around the world. We are committed to responsible and ethical sourcing led by Coffee and Farmer Equity Practices ('C.A.F.E. Practices'), the Company's third-party verification program and the cornerstone of our approach to ethical sourcing of coffee with over 98% of our coffee having been historically verified through C.A.F.E. Practices as ethically sourced.\n\n## Human Capital Management\n\nWe invest in the well-being - the mental, physical, and financial health - of every partner through our practices, policies, and benefits. This work is grounded in the belief that we are at our best when we create inclusive, supportive, and welcoming environments, where we uplift one another with dignity, respect, and kindness. And we are hard at work uplifting our communities and building environments in our stores that are welcoming and safe. We believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success as a global brand that leads with purpose. Therefore, one of our core strategies is to invest in and support our partners to differentiate our brand, products, and services in the competitive specialty coffee market, including the following areas of focus:\n\n## Oversight and Management\n\nWe recognize the diversity of customers, partners, and communities and believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures. Working under these principles, our Partner Resources Organization is tasked with managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning, performance management, and professional development. Our Board of Directors (the 'Board') and Board committees provide oversight on certain human capital matters, including our Inclusion and Diversity initiatives. As noted in its charter, our Compensation and Management Development Committee is responsible for periodically reviewing Starbucks partner resource programs and initiatives, including healthcare and other benefits, as well as our management development and succession planning practices and strategies. Our Audit and Compliance Committee works closely with the Risk Management Committee, led by Starbucks chief financial officer ('cfo') and chief legal officer, to monitor and mitigate current and emerging labor and human capital management risks. Our Environmental, Partner, and Community Impact Committee annually reviews and assesses the effectiveness of the Company's environmental and social\n\n## PART I",

      "answer": "Tesla continues to grant both incentive stock options (ISOs) and nonstatutory stock options under its 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, with options typically vesting over four years and exercisable for up to 10 years. In contrast, Starbucks notes that stock options have not been broadly used in recent years, with a strategic shift toward restricted stock units (RSUs), which are valued based on the closing stock price and recognized as nonvested shares. Home Depot explicitly states there are no incentive stock options outstanding under its current plans, though it retains the structure to issue them, with most options historically granted having nonforfeitable terms upon associates reaching age 60 with five years of service. This contrast reveals differing philosophies in equity compensation design across the firms\u2014Tesla maintaining traditional ISO structures, Starbucks moving toward RSUs for alignment and simplicity, and Home Depot phasing out ISOs in favor of more flexible or immediately valuable instruments.",

See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type, and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily include expenses related to raw materials, purchased goods, packaging, and delivery, along with operational costs of our supply chain organization. This encompasses wages, benefits, occupancy costs, and depreciation associated with sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Additionally, it includes costs related to inventory and supply chain asset impairments.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions, and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees, and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation",

LOW specifies that its PSUs vest over a three-year service period based on performance and/or market conditions, with vesting outcomes ranging from 0% to 200% of the target award, and notes that $19 million of PSUs vested in 2019, with grant-date fair values averaging $208.74 per unit in 2021. NKE explains that its PSUs are tied to multi-year performance criteria and continued employment, with payout levels ranging from 0% to 200% of the target award, and highlights that recipients receive dividend equivalents upon vesting.

NET INCOME PER SHARE\n\nThe Company computes basic net income per share by dividing net income applicable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted-average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.\n\nCommon equivalent shares related to stock options, restricted stock units, and performance share units are calculated using the treasury stock method. Performance share units are included in the weighted-average common equivalent shares based on the number of shares that would be issued if the end of the reporting period were the end of the performance period, if the result would be dilutive.\n\nThe Company's convertible notes have net share settlement features requiring the Company upon conversion to settle the principal amount of the debt for cash and the conversion premium for cash or shares of the Company's common stock, at the Company's option. Under the treasury stock method, if the conversion prices for the convertible notes exceed the Company's average stock price for the period, the convertible notes generally have no impact on diluted net income per share. The convertible notes are included in the calculation of diluted net income per share if their inclusion is dilutive under the treasury stock method.\n\nA reconciliation of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in calculating diluted net income per share is as follows (in thousands):\n\n",

Where multiple sources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize potential production risks due to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times.\n\nOur products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these materials is governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and demand and market speculation. We strive to execute long-term supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible, and we currently believe that we have adequate access to raw materials supplies to meet the needs of our operations.\n\n## Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations\n\nGlobally, the ownership of our products by our customers is impacted by various government credits, incentives, and policies. Our business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.\n\nThe operation of our business is also impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\n\n## Programs and Incentives\n\n## Inflation Reduction Act\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ('IRA') was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022, and remains subject to future guidance releases. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax credits to consumers. For example, under current legislation, qualifying Tesla customers may receive up to $7,500 in federal tax  credits for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles in the U.S. through 2032.\n\n## Automotive Regulatory Credits\n\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles ('ZEVs'), greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Energy Storage System Incentives and Policies\n\nWhile the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.\n\nFor example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal tax credits described below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ('FERC') has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self G eneration Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs. In certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration. In such transactions, they are included as a component of energy generation and storage revenues in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nPursuant to the IRA, under Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the Internal Revenue Code ('IRC'), standalone energy storage technology is eligible for a tax credit between 6% and 50% of qualified expenditures, regardless of the source of energy, which may be claimed by our customers for storage systems they purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These tax credits are primarily for the benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.",

We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for ex pected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\n\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer's lender when we arrange the financing are recognized upfront as an offset against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are ex pensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n\nWe offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under these programs, we originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606.",

In addition, changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies' policies, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the failure to successfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.\n\nWe also rely on a significant number of personnel to operate our stores, fulfillment network, and data centers and carry out our other operations. Failure to successfully hire, train, manage, and retain sufficient personnel to meet our needs can strain our operations, increase payroll and other costs, and harm our business and reputation. In addition, changes in laws and regulations applicable to employees, independent contractors, and temporary personnel could increase our payroll costs, decrease our operational flexibility, and negatively impact how we are able to staff our operations and supplement our workforce.\n\nWe are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time. These organizational efforts, if successful, decrease our operational flex ibility, which could adversely affect our operating efficiency. In addition, our response to any organizational efforts could be perceived negatively and harm our business and reputation.\n\n## Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks\n\nWe have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or geopolitical events, or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. For ex ample, we rely on a limited group of suppliers for semiconductor products, including products related to artificial intelligence infrastructure such as graphics processing units. Constraints on the availability of these products could adversely affect our ability to develop and operate artificial intelligence technologies, products, or services. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n\n## Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks\n\nWe provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company's sales. Therefore, when the other company's offerings are not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services.\n\nAs our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nOur present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such as:\n\n- disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\n- impairment of other relationships;\n- variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and\n- difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.",

These factors and others have also made, and may continue to make, it more difficult to maintain an effective system of operational internal controls for a dispersed workforce, and to train partners to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience. Additionally, there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers, who are necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. If we are unable to recruit, retain, and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes in the availability and cost of labor could adversely affect our business.\n\nOur business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs, both domestically and internationally. Such increases could be triggered by state and federal legislation and regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling, and benefits; increases in healthcare and workers' compensation insurance costs; and increases in wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high-quality employees with the right skill sets. For ex ample, at the federal level, effective July 1, 2024, the United States Department of Labor increased the minimum salary threshold requirements for employees who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act overtime requirements, and at the state level, Assembly Bill 1228 increased minimum wage and established working hour and working condition standards for certain partners in California. These changes, along with others that may occur in the future, could have a significant impact on the classification of employees as being exempt from overtime and add to our labor costs. The growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of employees, to maintain an effective system of operational internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise, and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience; the failure to do so could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, a shortage of labor for store positions, and the increased availability of alternative telecommuting employment options by other employers could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for other key functions. In addition, our wages and benefits programs may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent.\n\nStarting in September 2021, Starbucks partners at a number of company-operated stores sought union representation through elections conducted by the National Labor Relations Board. Unions have secured representation rights at hundreds of our more than 10,000 U.S. company-operated stores, with potentially more to follow, and Starbucks is engaged in collective bargaining for initial collective bargaining agreements for these stores. If we encounter difficulties negotiating collective bargaining agreements, are unsuccessful in those efforts, or obtain contracts with unfavorable terms, then we could incur additional costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility, and increase our operational complexity. These risks could also present the potential to disrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully implement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business needs.\n\nThe law places limitations on unilateral actions taken with respect to employees who are represented by unions because, in certain circumstances, the law requires the employer to notify and to bargain with the union prior to making certain operational or other changes that may affect employee wages, hours, or other terms and conditions of employment. Moreover, where a petition for representation has been filed by a union, the employer is also constrained from making changes in wages, hours, and working conditions. These limitations could also negatively affect our costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility, and increase our operational complexity. They also present the potential to disrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully implement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business needs.\n\nMoreover, we have experienced job actions in some company-operated stores. Such job actions and work stoppages have the potential to negatively impact our operations, third-party providers upon whom we rely to deliver product, our sales and customer flow in impacted locations, our costs, and can also have a negative impact on our reputation and brand.\n\nAdditionally, our position with respect to unions and the unionization of partners could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and could have material adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results. These positions could also expose us to legal risk, causing us to incur costs to defend legal and regulatory actions, potential penalties and restrictions, and reputational harm.\n\n## Risks Related to Competition\n\n## We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.\n\nThe specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience (such as delivery service and mobile ordering), and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all of these areas in each of our channels and markets. Accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. In the U.S., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to Starbucks stores and/or average value per transaction, adversely affecting our sales and results of operations.

      "answer": "Amazon faces semiconductor sourcing constraints that could hinder its ability to develop and operate AI technologies, particularly due to reliance on a limited group of suppliers for graphics processing units. This dependency poses a risk to their infrastructure scalability and innovation timeline. Home Depot, on the other hand, highlights compliance and reputational risks stemming from supplier adherence to responsible sourcing standards, including environmental laws, labor practices, and PFAS-related litigation exposure. These risks could impact product availability, legal liabilities, and brand reputation. Starbucks discloses a significant financial dependency on supplier relationships through its $180 million in fixed-price and $929 million in price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts. This represents a direct financial exposure to commodity price volatility and supplier delivery reliability, which is critical to its product consistency and cost management. Together, these examples illustrate that while all three companies depend heavily on supplier relationships, the nature of these dependencies varies: Amazon faces technical and operational risks from supply bottlenecks, Home Depot navigates regulatory and reputational risks from supplier behavior, and Starbucks is exposed to financial and commodity market risks tied to long-term purchase commitments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nsignificant competition in the technology industry, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. In addition, changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies' policies, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the failure to successfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.\n\nWe also rely on a significant number of personnel to operate our stores, fulfillment network, and data centers and carry out our other operations. Failure to successfully hire, train, manage, and retain sufficient personnel to meet our needs can strain our operations, increase payroll and other costs, and harm our business and reputation. In addition, changes in laws and regulations applicable to employees, independent contractors, and temporary personnel could increase our payroll costs, decrease our operational flexibility, and negatively impact how we are able to staff our operations and supplement our workforce.\n\nWe are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time. These organizational efforts, if successful, decrease our operational flex ibility, which could adversely affect our operating efficiency. In addition, our response to any organizational efforts could be perceived negatively and harm our business and reputation.\n\n## Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks\n\nWe have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or geopolitical events, or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. For ex ample, we rely on a limited group of suppliers for semiconductor products, including products related to artificial intelligence infrastructure such as graphics processing units. Constraints on the availability of these products could adversely affect our ability to develop and operate artificial intelligence technologies, products, or services. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n\n## Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks\n\nWe provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company's sales. Therefore, when the other company's offerings are not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services.\n\nAs our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nOur present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such as:\n\n- disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\n- impairment of other relationships;\n- variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and\n- difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.",

If we are unable to access products to meet our customers' demands and expectations in a timely and efficient manner, our sales and gross margin may be adv ersely impacted.\n\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality and safety and ensure compliance with responsible sourcing laws and standards could damage our reputation with customers, expose us to litigation or enforcement actions, and negatively impact our sales and results of operations.\n\nProduct and serv ice quality issues could negativ ely impact customer confidence in our brands and the Company. If our product and serv ice offerings, including those of our suppliers, do not meet applicable product standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety, quality, security, or responsible business practices, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks, as well as governmental enforcement actions. Actual, potential or perceiv ed product safety or security concerns, including health- or priv acy- related concerns, could expose, and in some cases hav e exposed, us to litigation or gov ernmental enforcement actions, and could result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. For instance, certain of the Company's suppliers hav e also been inv olv ed in litigation or gov ernmental enforcement actions related to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as 'PFAS,' and we could be exposed to similar actions. For any actions related to actual, potential, or perceiv ed product-safety concerns, we may not be successful in obtaining adequate contractual indemnification and insurance cov erage from our suppliers and serv ice prov iders, which may result in claims hav ing an adv erse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Ev en with adequate insurance and indemnification, our reputation as a prov ider of high-quality products, including both national brand names and our proprietary products, could suffer, damaging our reputation and impacting customer loyalty.\n\nIn addition, we and our customers hav e expectations around responsible sourcing, which has been an increasing focus of gov ernment regulators. Under the terms of our standard supplier buying agreements, our suppliers must comply with our responsible sourcing standards, which cov er a v ariety of expectations across multiple areas, including supply chain transparency, health and safety, env ironmental laws and regulations, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. Further, suppliers must comply with Company policies and applicable law, including the laws of the jurisdictions from which products and materials are sourced, regarding the sourcing of raw materials, including timber and minerals, used in our products. We have a responsible sourcing audit process, but we are also dependent on our suppliers to ensure that the products and serv ices we prov ide to our customers comply with our standards and applicable law, including with respect to information prov ided by suppliers to gov ernment agencies about the source of the products or the constituent elements of those products. Further, the supply chain for some of the products we sell may be too attenuated for us to know with certainty the source of their components, such as timber, minerals, or other raw materials. Actual, potential or perceiv ed supplier non-compliance with our standards or applicable law - including allegations of non-compliance raised by non-gov ernmental organizations or in third-party reports - could, and in certain instances in the past has, exposed us to litigation or gov ernmental enforcement actions and resulted in costly product recalls; resulted in inability to sell certain products due to failure to meet our standards or due to customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and exclusions; impacted our reputation; and resulted in termination of supplier relationships and/or other liabilities.\n\n## Our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks, including regulatory, product liability, intellectual property, supplier relations, and reputational risks.\n\nIn addition to other product-related risks discussed in this section, as we expand our proprietary product offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. The risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure, and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. To effectiv ely execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully nav igate and av oid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adv ersely affect sales of our suppliers' products, which in turn could adv ersely affect our relationships with certain of our suppliers. Any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and hav e an adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.",

A portion of our price-to-be-fix ed contracts are effectively fix ed through the use of futures. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, for further discussion. Price-to-be-fix ed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base 'C' coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For most contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to 'fix ' the base 'C' coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. For other contracts, Starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base 'C' coffee commodity price. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. We believe, based on established relationships with our suppliers and continuous monitoring, the risk of non-delivery on these purchase commitments is remote.\n\n## Note 6:    E quity Inv estments (in millions)\n\n",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Total Revenues -Refer to Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $11.0 billion. Substantially all of the Company's revenues are generated by providing online travel reservation services, which principally allow travelers to book travel reservations with travel service providers through the Company's platforms. Revenues consist of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions utilizing multiple custom systems.\n\nWe identified total revenues as a critical audit matter as the majority of the processes to calculate and record revenues are highly automated, rely on a number of custom systems, and involve interfacing significant volumes of data across multiple systems. Given the complex information technology (IT) environment, this required the involvement of professionals with expertise in IT to identify, test, and evaluate the revenue data flows, the revenue systems and the automated controls.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the Company's revenue transactions included the following, among others:\n\n- With the assistance of our IT specialists, we:\n- -Identified the systems used to calculate and record revenue transactions.",

Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 54",

Starbucks noted that disruptions in its technology systems, including cybersecurity incidents or system failures, could impair its ability to manage operations effectively and maintain product availability. Together, these perspectives reveal that while Home Depot and Nike face physical supply chain and forecasting risks, Starbucks is more vulnerable to digital and operational continuity issues affecting product availability.",

      "answer": "AMZN maintains valuation allowances primarily on foreign deferred tax assets, including $10.2 billion in foreign net operating loss carryforwards, some of which are subject to annual limitations and will begin expiring in 2024. BKNG has accrued U.S. state income taxes on future repatriation of international earnings and reports $259 million in U.S. state NOLs, most of which begin to expire in 2032. SBUX notes that repatriation of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings could trigger material U.S. state income tax liabilities, and it regularly reassesses reinvestment plans based on working capital needs. Together, these disclosures show that while all three companies recognize U.S. state income tax exposure on foreign earnings, they differ in their utilization of NOLs, accrual strategies, and reinvestment assumptions.",

      "question": "How do Amazon's investment-driven exposure, General Motors' regulatory-driven challenges, and Tesla's production-driven strategy regarding electric vehicles collectively shape their respective financial and operational trajectories in 2023?",
      "answer": "Amazon's exposure to electric vehicles is primarily through its equity investment in Rivian, which contributed a $797 million valuation gain in 2023 and represents a strategic commercial relationship involving electric vehicle purchases. In contrast, General Motors faces significant regulatory pressures tied to electric vehicle mandates, including compliance costs, potential penalties, and the need to invest heavily in EV technologies amid uncertain consumer adoption and infrastructure support. Tesla, as a dedicated EV manufacturer, leveraged its vertical integration and production scale to deliver over 1.8 million vehicles in 2023, driving $96.77 billion in revenue and $15 billion in net income, despite increasing capital expenditures. Together, these perspectives reveal a spectrum of EV-related strategies: Amazon as a strategic investor and customer, GM as a traditional automaker navigating regulatory and cost challenges, and Tesla as a market leader scaling production and profitability.",

Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including onpremises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers' ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth's most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,608,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for personnel across other parts of our business.\n\nAs we strive to be Earth's best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and develop the best talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (funded education for hourly employees) and the Amazon Technical Academy (software development engineer training). We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.",

Enhancements to our digital properties are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers, who research products online and check available inventory before going into one of our stores to view the products in person or talk to an associate and then make their purchase in store or online. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and reviews, compare prices, view our extended assortment, and purchase additional products. Our investments in a truly interconnected experience are focused on bringing together the power of our physical retail presence and the frictionless interaction of our digital capabilities.\n\nA significant majority of the traffic in our digital channels is on a mobile device. Mobile customers expect more simplicity and relevancy in their digital interactions. As a result, we have made significant investments to our digital properties to improve the overall presentation and ease of navigation for the user. We have also enhanced the 'shopability' of an online product by including more information on the product's landing page, including related products and/or parts of a collection, and a multitude of fulfillment options. Our focus on improving search capabilities, site functionality, category presentation, product content, speed to checkout, and enhanced fulfillment options has yielded higher traffic, better conversion and continued sales growth. It has also been critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, as customers have gravitated even more to the digital environment.\n\nFurther, we do not view the interconnected shopping experience as a specific transaction; rather, we believe it encompasses an entire journey from inspiration and know-how, to purchase and fulfillment, to post-purchase care and support. Customers expect more personalized messaging, so we are focusing on connecting marketing activities with the online and in-store experiences to create a seamless series of engagements across channels. From the inspirational point of the purchase journey to providing product know-how, we are continuing to invest in the infrastructure and capabilities needed to deliver the most relevant marketing messages to our customers based upon what is important for them today.\n\nStore Experience. Our stores remain the hub of our business, and we are investing to improve the customer shopping experience through easier navigation and increasing the convenience and speed of checkout. For several years, our associates have used web-enabled handheld devices we call 'GET phones' to help expedite the online order checkout process, locate products in the aisles and online, and check inventory on hand. To improve the customer's experience in our stores, we have also empowered our customers with additional self-help tools, including mobile app-enabled store navigation. Our app provides store-specific maps, which allow customers to pinpoint the exact location of an item on their mobile devices.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we leveraged the investments made in our stores over the past several years to operate effectively in the dynamic environment we faced throughout the year. These investments include our wayfinding sign and store refresh package in all of our U.S. stores; our self-service lockers, online order storage areas at front entrances, and curbside pickup, which offer convenient pickup options for online orders; electronic shelf label capabilities; and the re-design of the front-end area, including reconfigured service desks, improved layouts in all checkout areas, and expanded and enhanced self-checkout options. We believe these investments are driving higher customer satisfaction scores, and we will continue to invest to improve the customer experience going forward.\n\nInvesting in Associate Productivity. We continually strive to improve our store operations for our associates. Our goal is to remove complexity and inefficient processes from the stores to allow our associates to focus on our customers. To this end, we have continued to focus our efforts in such areas as optimizing product flow to decrease the amount of time a store associate spends locating product and to improve on-shelf product availability; creating a simpler order management system; expanding in-aisle, real-time mobile learning tools for our associates' own development and to assist with customer questions; and using labor model tools to better align associate activity with customer needs.\n\nInvesting in Safety. We are committed to maintaining a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and associates. We empower trained EH&amp;S associates to evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a Company-wide basis. Our EH&amp;S policies are woven into our everyday operations and are part of The Home Depot culture. Common program elements include: daily store inspection checklists (by department); routine follow-up audits from our store-based safety team members and regional, district and store operations field teams; equipment enhancements and preventative maintenance programs to promote physical safety; departmental merchandising safety standards; training and education programs for all associates, with varying degrees of training provided based on an associate's role and responsibilities; and awareness,",

In addition to the Company's financial performance, executives are now measured on a variety of quantitative metrics related to championing the Company's core values, improving representation within leadership roles (Senior Director and above) for women and other historically underrepresented groups and assessing feelings of inclusion within the Company.\n\nAlso in 2021, the Company launched a franchisee recruitment initiative to help increase the number of franchisees from all backgrounds, including historically underrepresented groups, in the Company's U.S. and International Operated Markets segments. The Company expects to expand the number of new franchisees through efforts in three areas: recruitment, financing, and ongoing learning and development. This efforttailored for each market-will seek to increase ownership opportunities for new talent worldwide, both in terms of the number of individual restaurants owned and the number of qualified franchisees overall. The Company has committed $250 million in the U.S. over five years to provide alternatives to traditional financing in order to help candidates-who may face socio-economic barriers-join the McDonald's System.\n\nIn order to support this DEI strategy with measurable data and transparent reporting, the Company published its first Diversity Snapshot in December 2021, which included data on employee, Board and franchisee representation and supplier diversity. As the Company progresses on its journey of accountability and transparency, it will continue to identify opportunities to further enhance its processes for collecting data and reporting measurable progress toward its DEI goals.\n\n## Workplace Health and Safety\n\nMcDonald's has always focused on protecting the health and safety of its people and customers. In early 2020, in response to the global COVID19 pandemic, the Company established a framework called Safety+ in order to foster an environment where restaurant crew feel safe and supported, and customers have a variety of choices for contactless order and payment. Throughout 2021, the Company has continued to make informed decisions and apply appropriate precautionary measures to adapt to new and evolving safety risks, with guidance from expert health authorities in most of the countries in which it operates, as well as the World Health Organization. Further, the Company continued its engagement of Mayo Clinic, a global leader in serious and complex healthcare, to provide ongoing counsel and expertise on emerging science in infection prevention and control, and to identify best practices to help protect restaurant crew and customers. All of these efforts build upon the work McDonald's has been committed to for decades, rooted in its core value of putting its customers and people first.\n\n## Respectful Workplace Environment\n\nFostering safe, inclusive and respectful workplaces, wherever McDonald's does business, has been integral to the Company for its more than 65year history. The Company understands the importance of providing a positive experience and making everyone feel valued, both in its offices and in McDonald's restaurants. In 2018, the Company introduced McDonald's Human Rights Policy, which outlines its commitment to respect its people and their rights. This commitment to respect human rights is also furthered by the Company's Standards of Business Conduct, which apply to Company employees, and its Supplier Code of Conduct, which sets forth human rights requirements for the Company's global suppliers. Company employees are trained on the Standards of Business Conduct and are required to annually certify their understanding of and commitment to upholding them. Further, in 2021 the Company announced a newly defined set of Global Brand Standards that extend requirements to all restaurants, whether Company-owned or franchised. The Global Brand Standards prioritize actions in four areas: harassment, discrimination and retaliation prevention; workplace violence prevention; restaurant employee feedback; and health and safety. Beginning in 2022, all restaurants will be assessed on the Global Brand Standards in accordance with the applicable McDonald's market's business evaluation processes.\n\nAs part of its commitment to a respectful workplace environment, the Company recognizes how important it is to provide channels for its employees to report human rights and similar concerns that may violate Company policies and standards. Employees can do so in many ways, including through an anonymous global channel, the Business Integrity Line, which is staffed by a live operator from an independent company and is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This is complemented by additional reporting channels in many markets. The Company expects its employees and franchisees to uphold human rights and cultivate respectful workplaces, which builds trust, protects the integrity of the McDonald's brand and fuels Systemwide success.\n\n## Compensation, Benefits and Talent Development\n\nThe compensation and benefits provided to U.S. and internationally-based Company employees, including both corporate staff and Companyowned restaurant employees, is established based upon competitive considerations in the relevant labor market. The amount and type of compensation varies by an employee's level and location, and may include some combination of the following (in addition to base pay): cash bonuses, stock-based awards, retirement savings programs, and health and welfare benefits. In addition, Company employees may receive paid time off, family care resources, tuition assistance and flexible work schedules.\n\nIn 2021, the Company publicly communicated its ongoing commitment to equal pay, which is supported by an annual pay gap analysis that aims to ensure equitable pay practices are consistently implemented and executed across the Company. The results of the 2021 pay gap analysis showed that the Company has substantially attained equal pay for women globally (99.85%) and that there was no pay gap disfavoring historically underrepresented groups in the U.S. In line with its core values, the Company continuously emphasizes the importance of pay that is competitive, non-discriminatory, performance-based, transparent and compliant with legal and regulatory standards.\n\nAdditionally, McDonald's has a long-standing commitment to providing training, education benefits and career path opportunities, which empower the people and communities it serves. The Company is committed to providing opportunities for people to enhance their skills and fulfill their potential through talent development programs, apprenticeship opportunities, language and technical skill training and support for continuing education, as it believes this helps to facilitate talent attraction, career development and retention. Further, McDonald's Hamburger University has eight campuses around the world to provide training for Company employees as well as franchisees and their",

McDonald's reports a weighted-average recognition period of 2.0 years for its nonvested share-based compensation, with stock options vesting in four equal installments starting one year after grant. Starbucks incorporates vesting periods into its valuation of stock options by using historical experience and expectations of future behavior, combining historical volatility with implied volatility for corresponding vesting durations.

These changes add complexity to legal and tax compliance and our internal controls, and our size and operating history may increase the likelihood that we will be subject to regulatory scrutiny or audits by tax authorities in various jurisdictions. In addition, by virtue of Booking.com's size and presence in the Netherlands, it is required to have a supervisory board to oversee the strategy and operations of Booking.com. While the existence of the supervisory board has not had a significant impact on our operations, under certain circumstances, this governance structure could require Booking.com to obtain supervisory board approval in order to take certain actions, which could result in delays or other unanticipated strategic or operational challenges.\n\nThere are various risks associated with the facilitation of payments from consumers, including risks related to fraud, compliance with evolving rules and regulations, and reliance on third parties.\n\nOur results have been and will likely continue to be negatively impacted by consumer purchases made using fraudulent payment cards (such as credit, debit, prepaid, or similar cards), claims the consumer did not authorize the purchase, or consumers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in their bank accounts to satisfy payments. We may be held liable for accepting fraudulent payment cards (such as stolen or cloned cards) on our platforms or in connection with other fraudulent transactions on our platforms, as well as other payment disputes with consumers. Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting chargebacks. We must also continually implement and evolve measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, in particular as these methods become increasingly sophisticated. If we are unable to successfully combat the use of fraudulent payment cards on our platforms, our business, profit margins, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe are processing more of our transactions on a merchant basis where we facilitate payments from travelers through the use of payment cards and other payment methods (such as PayPal, Alipay, Paytm, and WeChat Pay). While processing transactions on a merchant basis allows us to process transactions for properties that do not otherwise accept payment cards and to increase our ability to offer a variety of payment methods and flexible transaction terms to consumers, we incur additional payment processing costs (which are typically higher for foreign currency transactions) and other costs related to these transactions, such as costs related to fraudulent payments and transactions and fraud detection. As we expand our payments services to consumers and business partners, in addition to the revenues from these transactions, we may experience a significant increase in these costs, and our results of operations and profit margins could be materially adversely affected, in particular if we experience a significant increase in non-variable costs related to fraudulent payments and transactions.\n\nAs a greater percentage of our transactions involve us processing payments, our global systems and processes must be managed on a larger scale, which adds complexity, administrative burdens and costs, and increases the demands on our systems and controls, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, as our payment processing activities continue to develop, we expect to be subject to additional regulations, including financial services regulations, which we expect to result in increased compliance costs and complexities, including those associated with the implementation of new or advanced internal controls. For example, the E.U.'s Payment Services Directive 2, implemented in the UK through the Payment Services Regulations 2017, has further complicated the authentication process for accepting payment cards and other payment methods. As a result of this, payments made on our platforms by consumers in the UK and the European Economic Area are subject to Strong Customer Authentication, which requires the consumer to engage in additional steps to authenticate their transaction. This new requirement could cause consumer transactions to take longer to process or otherwise inconvenience the consumer, which could result in consumers choosing not to utilize our platforms as often or at all. The implementation of this process has resulted and may continue to result in increased compliance costs and administrative burdens for us. Additionally, except where a consumer has acted fraudulently, the consumer will not be liable for any losses incurred in respect of an unauthorized payment transaction where strong customer authentication should have been applied but we did not require it.",

Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact. Forward-looking  statements  represent  our  current  judgment  about  possible  future  events  and  are  often  identified  by  words  like 'aim,'  'anticipate,'  'appears,'  'approximately,'  'believe,'  'continue,'  'could,'  'designed,'  'effect,'  'estimate,'  'evaluate,' 'expect,'  'forecast,'  'goal,'  'initiative,'  'intend,'  'may,'  'objective,'  'outlook,'  'plan,'  'potential,'  'priorities,'  'project,' 'pursue,'  'seek,'  'should,'  'target,'  'when,'  'will,'  'would,'  or  the  negative  of  any  of  those  words  or  similar  expressions.  In making these statements, we rely on assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these  judgments  are  reasonable,  but  these  statements  are  not  guarantees  of  any  future  events  or  financial  results,  and  our  actual results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors, which may be  revised  or  supplemented  in  subsequent  reports  we  file  with  the  SEC,  include,  among  others,  the  following:  (1)  our  ability  to deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry; (2) our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models, including electric vehicles, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers; (3) our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of electric vehicles that will help drive consumer adoption; (4) the success of our current line of full-size SUVs and full-size pickup trucks; (5) our highly competitive industry, which has been historically characterized by excess manufacturing capacity and the use of  incentives,  and  the  introduction  of  new  and  improved  vehicle  models  by  our  competitors;  (6)  the  unique  technological, operational,  regulatory  and  competitive  risks  related  to  the  timing  and  commercialization  of  autonomous  vehicles;  (7)  risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, our transition to electric vehicles and the  potential  increased  impacts  of  severe  weather  events;  (8)  global  automobile  market  sales  volume,  which  can  be  volatile;  (9) prices  and  uncertain  availability  of  raw  materials  and  commodities  used  by  us  and  our  suppliers,  and  instability  in  logistics  and related costs; (10) our business in China, which is subject to unique operational, competitive, regulatory and economic risks; (11) the success of our ongoing strategic business relationships and of our joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which we may have limited control; (12) the international scale and footprint of our operations, which exposes us to a variety of unique  political,  economic,  competitive  and  regulatory  risks,  including  the  risk  of  changes  in  government  leadership  and  laws (including  labor,  trade,  tax  and  other  laws),  political  uncertainty  or  instability  and  economic  tensions  between  governments  and changes in international trade policies, new barriers to entry and changes to or withdrawals from free trade agreements, changes in foreign  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates,  economic  downturns  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate,  differing  local  product preferences and product requirements, changes to and compliance with U.S. and foreign countries' export controls and economic sanctions,  differing  labor  regulations,  requirements  and  union  relationships,  differing  dealer  and  franchise  regulations  and relationships,  difficulties  in  obtaining  financing  in  foreign  countries,  and  public  health  crises,  including  the  occurrence  of  a contagious disease or illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; (13) any significant disruption, including any work stoppages, at any of our manufacturing facilities; (14) the ability of our suppliers to deliver parts, systems and components without disruption and at such times to allow us to meet production schedules; (15) the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; (16) the success of any restructurings or  other  cost  reduction  actions;  (17)  the  possibility  that  competitors  may  independently  develop  products  and  services  similar  to ours, or that our intellectual property rights are not sufficient to prevent competitors from developing or selling those products or services; (18) our ability to manage risks related to security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology systems and networked products, including connected vehicles and in-vehicle systems; (19) our ability to comply with increasingly complex, restrictive and punitive regulations relating to our enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing and security of the Personal  Identifiable  Information  of  our  customers,  employees,  or  suppliers;  (20)  our  ability  to  comply  with  extensive  laws, regulations  and  policies  applicable  to  our  operations  and  products,  including  those  relating  to  fuel  economy,  emissions  and autonomous vehicles; (21) costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations; (22) the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services; (23) any additional tax expense or exposure; (24) our continued ability to develop captive financing capability through GM Financial; and (25) any significant increase in our pension funding requirements. For a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except where we are expressly required to do so by law.\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *",

Such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations, which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of non-compliance. Changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, including increased or additional regulations and associated costs to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, incremental investments and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are subject to additional domestic and foreign governmental regulations and health guidelines, as well as any other voluntary safety protocols.\n\nIn addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area. Current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the GDPR and the CCPA, discussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable international and U.S. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of fines, litigation or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business.\n\nThe complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related costs of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\n\n## Item 1B.

      "question": "How do BKNG, MCD, and TSLA each allocate their cash equivalents into Certificates of Deposit (CDs), and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to short-term liquidity management, noting differences in disclosure specificity?",
      "answer": "BKNG holds $60 million in Certificates of Deposit as part of its cash equivalents, as disclosed in its 2023 10-K filing. MCD reports that $4.0 billion of its $4.6 billion in Cash and equivalents consisted of certificates of deposit, indicating a much larger allocation to CDs relative to total cash holdings. TSLA includes certificates of deposit among its Level II fair value investments, but does not provide specific dollar amounts. This reveals varying approaches to liquidity management: BKNG maintains a minimal allocation to CDs as part of a diversified cash equivalent strategy, MCD relies heavily on CDs for liquidity, and TSLA incorporates CDs within a broader Level II investment portfolio without disclosing specific allocations. The differences in disclosure specificity\u2014ranging from detailed dollar amounts to general classification\u2014suggest varying degrees of transparency in how each company manages short-term liquidity.",

Nation-state actors have in the past carried out, and may in the future carry out, cyber-attacks to achieve their aims and goals, which may include espionage, information operations, monetary gain, ransomware, disruption, and destruction. To achieve their objectives, nation-state actors and other cyber criminals have used and may continue to use numerous attack vectors and methods, including use of stolen passwords, social engineering, phishing, identity spoofing, ransomware or other disruptive and destructive malware, supply chain compromises, and man-in-the-middle and denial of service attacks. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly changing and evolving, increasing in frequency and sophistication, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time.\n\nWe have implemented and regularly review and update systems, processes, and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss and preserve data integrity. However, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and business partners must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, as well as those of companies we acquire. There is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all threats, including vulnerabilities, data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data. As we saw in connection with the data breach we experienced in 2014, any significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or Company data, could result in significant costs, including costs to investigate and remediate, as well as lost sales, fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and damage to our reputation. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of anomalous activity or compromise, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures, and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach, vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs.\n\nIn addition, data governance failures can adversely affect our reputation and business. Our business depends on our customers' and associates' willingness to entrust us with their personal information. Events that adversely affect that trust, including inadequate disclosure to our customers or our associates of our uses of their information or failing to keep our information technology systems and our customers' and associates' sensitive information secure from significant attack, theft, damage, loss or unauthorized disclosure or access, whether as a result of our action or inaction (including human error or malfeasance) or that of our service providers or other third parties, could adversely affect our brand and harm our reputation. Further, the regulatory environment related to data privacy and cybersecurity is constantly changing, with new and increasingly rigorous requirements applicable to our business. The implementation of these requirements has also become more complex. Maintaining our compliance with those requirements, including recently enacted state consumer privacy laws, may require significant effort and cost, require changes to our business practices, and limit our ability to obtain data used to provide a personalized customer experience. In addition, failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to fines, sanctions, governmental investigations, lawsuits or reputational damage. While we maintain cyber insurance, our coverage may not be adequate for liabilities or costs actually incurred, and we cannot be certain that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage of a future claim.\n\nWe are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability, and potentially disrupt our business.\n\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards, cash, checks, PayPal, an installment loan program, trade credit, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult, costly, or uncertain. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by threat actors, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in our payments and payment processing systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs",

          "chunk_text": "Cyber attacks and tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving, and high profile security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred in recent years with increasing frequency at a number of major U.S. companies, including several large retailers, despite widespread recognition of the cyber-attack threat and improved data protection methods. As with many other retailers, we collect, process, transmit, store, and delete certain personal information about our customers, employees and vendors, as well as confidential, sensitive, proprietary and business, personal and payment card information. Additionally, we use third-party service providers for certain services, such as authentication, content delivery, back-office support, fraud prevention, order and service fulfillment, supply chain management, customer service, workforce management, and other functions, and we provide such third-party service providers with personal and other confidential information necessary for the services concerned. We are subject to the risk that unauthorized parties will attempt to gain access to our systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third party providers, or vendors. Certain of our third-party vendors have been subject to disruptions due to ransomware and other cyber attacks. We and our third-party service providers may not be able to adequately anticipate or prevent a future breach in our or their systems that results in the unauthorized access to, destruction, misuse, or release of personal information or other sensitive data. It can be difficult to preempt or detect ever-evolving forms of cyber-attacks. A ransomware attack could prevent us or our third-party service providers from accessing data or systems that support Lowe's operations. Our information security or our service providers' information security may also be compromised because of human errors, including by employees, or system errors. Our systems and our service providers' systems are additionally vulnerable to a number of other causes, such as critical infrastructure outages, computer viruses, technology system failures, catastrophic events or cyber-attacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, and ransomware. In the event that our systems are breached or damaged for any reason, we may also suffer loss or unavailability of data and interruptions to our business operations while such breach or damage is being remedied. Should these events occur, the unauthorized disclosure, loss or unavailability of data and disruption to our business may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, drive existing and potential customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, or potential liability, including possible litigation and punitive damages. A security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of data from our information systems or our third-party service providers' information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks and require dedication of substantial resources to manage the aftermath of such a breach.\n\nData privacy and cybersecurity laws in the United States and internationally are constantly changing, and the implementation of these laws has become more complex. In the United States alone, we may be subject to regulation at both the federal and state level. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and its subsequent amendment grants California consumers certain rights over their personal information and imposes stringent requirements on the collection, use and sharing of 'personal information' of California consumers. Other U.S. states are proposing or have adopted similar laws related to the protection of personal information, including the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which will go into effect in 2023, and the U.S. federal government is also considering federal privacy legislation. In order to maintain our compliance with such laws as they come to fruition, we may sustain increased costs in order to continually evaluate our policies and processes and adapt to new requirements that are or become applicable to us. As the regulatory environment relating to retailers' and other companies' obligation to protect personal information becomes stricter, a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines, other regulatory sanctions or government investigation, and potentially to lawsuits brought by private individuals, regulators or states' attorney general. Such violation or perceived violation of privacy, including improper collection, use of sharing of personal information, or failure to sufficiently disclose privacy practice, can adversely affect the trust that customers, employees, and business partners have in us related to their personal information.\n\nWe are subject to payments-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business.\n\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit cards, debit cards, credit accounts, our private label and co-branded credit cards, PayPal, trade credit, gift cards, cash, consumer invoicing and physical bank checks, and we may offer different payment options over time. These payment options subject us to many compliance requirements, including, but not limited to, compliance with payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, rules governing electronic funds transfers and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. They also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, gift cards and promotional financing, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our",

Our solar PPAs, offered to commercial customers, charges a fee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of electricity produced by our solar energy systems.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\n## Manufacturing Facilities in the Bay Area, California\n\nWe manufacture and test our vehicles at our manufacturing facilities in the Bay Area in California, including the Fremont Factory and other local manufacturing facilities. We also manufacture and develop certain parts and components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality standards, such as Model S and Model X battery packs and our proprietary lithium-ion battery cells, at these locations.\n\n## Gigafactory Nevada near Reno, Nevada\n\nOur battery material, cell, module and battery pack production for Model 3, Model Y and our energy products are manufactured in one location at Gigafactory Nevada. In addition, we manufacture vehicle drive units and energy storage components there. Gigafactory Nevada allows us to access high volumes of lithium-ion battery cells manufactured by our partner Panasonic there while achieving a significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs. We continue to invest in Gigafactory Nevada to achieve additional output there.\n\n## Gigafactory New York in Buffalo, New York\n\nWe use Gigafactory New York for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components and Supercharger components and for other functions.\n\n## Gigafactory Shanghai in China\n\nWe established Gigafactory Shanghai to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the impact of unfavorable tariffs. We continue to increase the degree of localized procurement and manufacturing there. Gigafactory Shanghai is representative of our plan to iteratively improve our manufacturing operations as we establish new factories, as we implemented the learnings from our Model 3 and Model Y ramp at the Fremont Factory to commence and ramp our production at Gigafactory Shanghai quickly and cost-effectively.\n\n## Other Manufacturing\n\nGenerally, we continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities. We also intend to further increase costcompetitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding local manufacturing, including at Gigafactory Berlin in Germany and Gigafactory Texas in Austin, Texas, which will begin production in 2022.\n\n## Supply Chain\n\nOur products use thousands of purchased parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships with vendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or are similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale.\n\nAs is the case for most automotive companies, most of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. Where multiple sources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize production risks owing to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times.",

      "question": "How do Nike, Starbucks, and Tesla each address the relationship between labor controversies and brand reputation risks in their 10-K filings?",
      "answer": "Nike highlights that negative publicity involving its suppliers' labor practices could seriously damage its reputation and brand image, regardless of whether the claims are accurate. The company requires suppliers to comply with applicable laws, but it explicitly acknowledges that it does not control their practices, leaving it vulnerable to reputational harm. Starbucks discusses how unionization efforts and labor disputes in its U.S. company-operated stores could negatively affect how its brand is perceived, potentially leading to reputational harm and material adverse effects on its business and financial results. Tesla notes that labor unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against it, and any unfavorable outcomes from these actions may harm the perception of Tesla's treatment of employees. Additionally, work stoppages at companies in Tesla\u2019s supply chain could delay product manufacturing and sales, harming its business and brand. Together, these disclosures reveal that all three companies view labor controversies as significant risks to brand perception, though each faces different manifestations of this risk based on their operational models.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE \u2192 Brand Perception: Nike acknowledges that negative claims about its suppliers\u2019 labor practices could damage its brand, even if the claims are inaccurate, due to its reliance on supplier compliance without direct control.",
        "Hop 2: SBUX \u2192 Brand Perception: Starbucks states that unionization efforts and labor disputes could harm how its brand is perceived, with potential reputational and financial consequences.",
        "Hop 3: TSLA \u2192 Brand Perception: Tesla discloses that labor-related legal actions and supply chain disruptions due to union activities could negatively impact brand perception and operating results."

      "question": "How does the number of retail stores operated by Home Depot and Lowe's in Nevada compare to Tesla's capital investment commitments in the state, and what does this reveal about each company's strategic prioritization of Nevada in their respective business models?",
      "answer": "Home Depot operates 21 stores in Nevada, while Lowe's operates 17 stores, indicating a relatively modest retail footprint in the state for both companies. In contrast, Tesla's strategic engagement with Nevada is centered around its Gigafactory operations, supported by a formal tax abatement and incentives agreement with the Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development. While Home Depot and Lowe's treat Nevada as one of many regional markets for consumer retail, Tesla's presence is anchored in large-scale manufacturing and long-term capital investment, as evidenced by multiple lease amendments and pricing agreements with Panasonic related to Gigafactory 1. This contrast highlights how Tesla's strategic prioritization of Nevada involves significant infrastructure investment and incentive-driven cost optimization, whereas the home improvement retailers focus on geographic diversification with Nevada representing a smaller portion of their nationwide store networks.",

      "question": "How do HD, LOW, and SBUX each structure their exposure to floating-rate notes, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to interest rate risk management in 2024?",
      "answer": "HD issued $600 million in floating-rate notes in June 2024, tied to SOFR plus 33 basis points with quarterly interest payments. LOW has a history of issuing floating-rate notes, as seen in its 2015\u20132020 supplemental indentures, including floating-rate tranches maturing in 2018 and 2019.

      "question": "How do Lowe's, McDonald's, and Starbucks each assess the potential financial or operational impact of government regulation on their business models, and what does this reveal about their exposure to regulatory risk in the consumer discretionary sector?",
      "answer": "Lowe's and Starbucks both indicate that they do not expect compliance with government regulations to have a material effect on their capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position compared to prior periods. In contrast, McDonald's highlights that its operations may be significantly impacted by regulations affecting capital flows, financial markets, or financial institutions, which could limit its ability to manage liquidity or increase funding costs. This suggests that while Lowe's and Starbucks view regulatory risk as stable, McDonald's perceives a higher sensitivity to regulatory changes, particularly in financial and capital-related domains.",

        "Hop 1: LOW \u2192 Government Regulation: Lowe's states that it does not expect compliance with government regulations to have a material effect on its capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position compared to prior periods.",

        "Hop 3: SBUX \u2192 Government Regulation: Starbucks states that while it is subject to laws and regulations across multiple jurisdictions, changes to such regulations are not expected to have a material effect on its capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position compared to prior periods."

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, GM experienced supply chain disruptions that limited production and affected vehicle availability, reducing its ability to meet consumer demand. NKE reported a $2,183 million increase in Inventories due to supply chain constraints, which led to higher in-transit inventory and lower available stock, impacting cash flow from operations. SBUX saw its Channel Development operating margin decline by 520 basis points, with approximately 340 basis points attributed to supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. Additionally, NKE adjusted its capital allocation by increasing expenditures on supply chain infrastructure, while SBUX faced margin compression that likely constrained reinvestment capacity. GM\u2019s production limitations, NKE\u2019s inventory buildup, and SBUX\u2019s margin erosion illustrate how supply chain issues affected different aspects of operations across the consumer discretionary sector.",

Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $6,848 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2022 compared to $6,612 million for fiscal 2021. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease to Cash provided (used) by operations of $1,660 million for fiscal 2022, compared to an increase of $45 million for fiscal 2021. The net change in working capital was unfavorably impacted by a $2,183 million increase in Inventories, partially offset by a favorable impact from a $1,102 million decrease in Accounts receivable. These changes were, in part, due to supply chain constraints, which caused higher levels of in-transit inventory and therefore a lower supply of available inventory to meet consumer demand.\n\nCash provided (used) by investing activities was an outflow of $1,524 million for fiscal 2022, compared to an outflow of $3,800 million for fiscal 2021, primarily driven by the net change in short-term investments. During fiscal 2022, the net change in short-term investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash outflow of $747 million compared to a cash outflow of $3,276 million in fiscal 2021. Additionally, during fiscal 2022, we continued investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, specifically focused around digital capabilities, our end-to-end technology foundation, our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain. In future periods, we expect to make annual capital expenditures of approximately 3% of annual revenues.\n\nCash provided (used) by financing activities was an outflow of $4,836 million for fiscal 2022 compared to an outflow of $1,459 million for fiscal 2021. This change was driven by our resumption of the share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, resulting in $4,014 million of share repurchases during fiscal 2022 compared to $608 million during fiscal 2021.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we purchased 27.3 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $3,994 million (an average price of $146.11 per share) under the four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018. As of May 31, 2022, we had repurchased 77.4 million shares at a cost of $8,663 million (an average price of $111.98 per share) under this program. In June 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new four-year, $18 billion program to repurchase shares of the Company's Class B common stock. The new program will replace the current $15 billion share repurchase program, which will be terminated in fiscal 2023. Repurchases under the new program will be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The new share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended at any time at our discretion. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows and excess cash. The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.\n\n## CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nOn July 23, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement (the 'Shelf') with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 23, 2022, and we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the SEC in July 2022.\n\nOn March 11, 2022, we entered into a 364-day committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $1.5 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 10, 2023, with an option to extend the maturity date an additional 364 days. This facility replaces the prior $1 billion 364-day credit facility agreement entered into on March 15, 2021, which would have matured on March 14, 2022. Refer to Note 7 - Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information.\n\nOn March 11, 2022, we also entered into a five-year committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $3 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 11, 2027, with options to extend the maturity date up to an additional two years. This facility replaces the prior $2 billion five-year credit facility agreement entered into on August 16, 2019, which would have matured on August 16, 2024. Refer to Note 7 - Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information.\n\nWe currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. As it relates to our committed credit facilities entered into on March 11, 2022, if our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fees and interest rates would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fees and interest rates would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities. Under these facilities, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities, failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 45",

These increases were partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($21 million).\n\n## Operating Margin\n\nChannel Development operating income for fiscal 2022 increased 4% to $817 million, compared to $789 million in fiscal 2021. Operating margin decreased 520 basis points to 44.3%, primarily due to a decline in our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture income due to inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints (approximately 340 basis points) and business mix shift (approximately 170 basis points).",

      "answer": "GM uses interest rate swap agreements both as fair value hedges and cash flow hedges to manage interest rate risk associated with its debt instruments. Changes in fair value of these hedges are recorded in interest, operating, and other expenses. NKE has entered into interest rate swap agreements linked to its term debt, where it receives fixed interest and pays variable based on SOFR plus a spread. These swaps, totaling $1.8 billion, mature in fiscal 2034 and are used to manage interest rate exposure on long-term debt. SBUX employs interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. These instruments are part of a broader market risk management policy that also includes limits on speculative trading and counterparty risk. The comparative analysis shows that while all three companies use interest rate swaps, GM focuses on both fair value and cash flow hedging, NKE emphasizes long-term variable rate exposure management, and SBUX integrates swaps within a comprehensive risk management framework aligned with anticipated financing needs.",

      "question": "How do BKNG, SBUX, and TSLA each leverage copyrights to protect or enhance their distinct business models, and what does this reveal about the strategic importance of intellectual property in their respective consumer discretionary offerings?",
      "answer": "BKNG relies on copyrights as part of its broader intellectual property protections to support its scalable and secure digital platforms, which are critical for connecting with vendors and ensuring secure communications and transactions. SBUX owns copyrights for product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics, and training materials, which help reinforce brand identity and consistency across its global retail footprint. TSLA emphasizes copyrights as part of a broader intellectual property strategy to protect innovations in design and technology, particularly in its vehicle and energy systems, while also promoting open innovation in electric vehicles through its patent pledge. Together, these approaches show that while all three companies value copyrights as part of their IP portfolios, they apply them differently\u2014BKNG for digital infrastructure, SBUX for brand and in-store experience, and TSLA for innovation and ecosystem development.",

        "Hop 1: BKNG \u2192 Copyrights: BKNG relies on copyrights as part of its intellectual property protections, which support its technology systems and secure communications, especially as it modernizes its platforms and expands cloud-based infrastructure.",

      "question": "How do AMZN, MCD, and TSLA each approach the protection and strategic use of copyrights, and what does this reveal about their respective competitive strategies in the consumer discretionary sector?",
      "answer": "AMZN actively registers copyrights as part of its broader intellectual property strategy, emphasizing their critical role in the company\u2019s success and securing them globally. MCD depends on copyrights as part of its intellectual property portfolio to maintain brand strength and consistency across global markets, though it acknowledges the challenges of protecting these rights internationally. TSLA seeks to protect its innovations through copyrights and other IP mechanisms, but uniquely emphasizes open innovation by pledging not to sue in good faith for EV-related IP infringement, aiming to accelerate industry growth. Together, these approaches highlight AMZN\u2019s defensive posture, MCD\u2019s brand-centric reliance, and TSLA\u2019s open-innovation strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMZN \u2192 Copyrights: Amazon explicitly states that it has registered or applied for the registration of a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights, indicating a proactive and expansive approach to IP protection.",
        "Hop 2: MCD \u2192 Copyrights: McDonald's acknowledges that it relies on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents, and other intellectual property rights to protect its brand, but notes the challenges of global registration and enforcement, especially in rapidly evolving areas.",
        "Hop 3: TSLA \u2192 Copyrights: Tesla states that it seeks to protect its innovations through various intellectual property rights, including copyrights, but also emphasizes its irrevocable pledge not to sue for good faith infringement related to electric vehicles, promoting broader industry adoption."

      "question": "How do GM, LOW, and SBUX each utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage financial risk, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to hedging against interest rate fluctuations?",
      "answer": "GM utilizes interest rate swap agreements primarily as fair value and cash flow hedges to manage exposure to interest rate risk on debt and forecasted transactions, with changes in fair value impacting GM Financial interest, operating, and other expenses. LOW notes the use of interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges but emphasizes that nearly all of its long-term debt is fixed-rate and carried at amortized cost, making interest rate risk exposure immaterial. SBUX uses interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances, aligning with its broader market risk management policy. The comparative analysis reveals that while all three companies use interest rate swaps, GM and SBUX actively hedge against interest rate exposure, whereas LOW considers it immaterial due to its fixed-rate debt structure.",

Tesla, through its subsidiary SolarCity, engaged U.S. Bank National Association as trustee for a series of solar bonds with specific maturity profiles (e.g., 4.70% Solar Bonds, Series 2015/C19-10 and 5.45% Solar Bonds, Series 2015/C20-15), reflecting a project-specific and asset-backed approach to debt financing. Collectively, these relationships show that while all three companies rely on U.S. Bank National Association for debt structuring, they differ in terms of maturity profiles, interest rate strategies, and the nature of financing (general corporate debt vs. asset-backed obligations).",

      "answer": "Booking Holdings issues a variety of senior notes with maturities ranging from 2025 to 2034, including 0.100% notes due in 2025 and 4.750% notes due in 2034, managed through U.S. Bank as trustee and transfer agent. Lowe\u2019s has a long-standing indenture relationship with U.S. Bank, issuing notes such as the 3.100% notes due 2027 and 4.550% notes due 2049, showing a focus on long-dated debt. Starbucks also utilizes U.S. Bank for structured debt, issuing 4.750% Senior Notes due 2026 and 4.800% Senior Notes due 2033, indicating a preference for mid- to long-term financing. Collectively, these patterns show that all three firms rely on U.S. Bank for structured capital markets access, but with differing maturity profiles and interest rate strategies that reflect their individual liquidity and investment needs.",

      "question": "How do AMZN, SBUX, and TSLA each incorporate vesting schedules into their equity compensation frameworks, and what do their respective disclosures reveal about the complexity and strategic intent behind these structures?",
      "answer": "AMZN provides a quantitative schedule outlining the vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs) as of December 31, 2021, indicating a structured, time-based approach to equity compensation. SBUX emphasizes the integration of vesting schedules into the valuation of stock options, factoring in historical behavior, volatility, and risk-free interest rates to estimate fair value. TSLA employs a highly performance-linked vesting schedule for its 2018 CEO Performance Award, requiring both market capitalization milestones (starting at $100 billion) and operational metrics such as revenue or Adjusted EBITDA over four consecutive fiscal quarters. The synthesis reveals that while AMZN focuses on predictable time-based vesting, SBUX incorporates vesting into broader valuation modeling, and TSLA uses it as a strategic lever tied to aggressive performance targets.",

We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.\n\n## 2018 CEO Performance Award\n\nIn March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors' grant of 101.3 million stock option awards, as adjusted to give effect to the five-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2020 ('Stock Split'), to our CEO (the '2018 CEO Performance Award'). The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at $100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0 billion thereafter (based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been achieved for the four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial statements filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of the exercise price of $70.01 per share, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five years post-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding.\n\nThe achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2021 is provided below. Although an operational milestone is deemed achieved in the last quarter of the relevant annualized period, it may be certified only after the financial statements supporting its achievement have been filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K.\n\n",

      "answer": "Nike highlights that counterfeit products and intellectual property (IP) infringement could shift consumer preference and damage its brand, while also noting the risks posed by generative AI and the importance of protecting virtual goods. Starbucks emphasizes that cybersecurity breaches could lead to unauthorized access of customer and employee data, harming its brand and resulting in significant costs for recovery and notification. Tesla acknowledges the potential for IP litigation and misappropriation of trade secrets, which could harm its brand and require costly redesigns or licensing agreements. Collectively, all three companies identify brand risk stemming from IP and cybersecurity issues, but Nike focuses on product imitation and digital IP, Starbucks on data breaches and customer trust, and Tesla on legal exposure and innovation protection.",

      "answer": "General Motors affirms that it has filed all required reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the preceding 12 months and has been subject to these filing requirements for the past 90 days. It also confirms that its registered public accounting firm has provided a report on and attestation to management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Lowe's similarly confirms that it has filed all required reports and has been subject to the filing requirements for the past 90 days, but does not mention the Section 404(b) attestation. Tesla states that it has filed all required reports and been subject to the filing requirements for the past 90 days, but like Lowe's, it does not specifically reference the Section 404(b) attestation.

      "question": "How do AMZN, GM, and TSLA each approach inventory valuation, and what do their respective disclosures reveal about how they manage inventory risk in light of demand volatility?",
      "answer": "AMZN uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for inventory valuation and writes down inventory based on expected disposition methods, with a valuation allowance of $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. GM does not directly disclose its inventory valuation method but subjects its dealers to credit risk monitoring, which indirectly affects inventory financing and risk exposure. TSLA uses FIFO for vehicles and energy storage products and actual cost for solar systems, with inventory write-downs based on demand forecasts and net realizable value assessments, noting that once inventory is written down, the new basis is not adjusted upward even if circumstances change. Collectively, these approaches show that AMZN and TSLA proactively manage inventory risk through conservative valuation allowances and forecast-based write-downs, while GM focuses on mitigating risk through dealer credit controls rather than inventory write-downs.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\n\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.\n\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\n\nLevel 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\n\nLevel 2 - Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\n\nLevel 3 - Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\n\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\n\nWe hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, these warrants had a fair value of $3.0 billion and $3.4 billion, and are recorded within 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a writedown of inventory, was $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "## MyPower Customer Notes Receivable\n\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $299 million and $334 million, respectively, of which $11 million and $9 million were due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the allowance for expected credit losses was $41 million and $45 million, respectively.\n\n## Concentration of Risk\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, accounts receivable, convertible note hedges, and interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the U.S. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, no entity represented 10% or more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our convertible note hedges and interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly-rated multinational banks.\n\n## Supply Risk\n\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n\n## Operating Lease Vehicles\n\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated depreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $5.28 billion and $3.54 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $773 million and $446 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Digital Assets, Net\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we purchased an aggregate of $1.50 billion in bitcoin (a \"digital asset\") and briefly accepted bitcoin as a payment for sales of certain of our products in specified regions, subject to applicable laws. We account for such non-cash consideration at the time we enter into transactions with our customers in accordance with the non-cash consideration guidance included in the Accounting Standards Codification ('ASC') 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , based on the then current quoted market prices of the digital assets.",

      "question": "How do GM, HD, and LOW each utilize interest rate swap agreements, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to managing interest rate risk?",
      "answer": "GM utilizes interest rate swap agreements both as fair value hedges and cash flow hedges, with changes in fair value impacting interest, operating, and other expenses. HD amended its interest rate swap agreements to replace LIBOR with SOFR and primarily uses cash flow hedges to manage variability in interest payments on forecasted debt issuances, with immaterial unamortized losses. LOW uses interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on certain debt, but notes that interest rate fluctuations do not have a material impact on its financial condition due to its largely fixed-rate debt structure. Collectively, this shows that while all three companies use interest rate swaps, their strategies and sensitivities to interest rate risk differ based on debt composition and hedging focus.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GM \u2192 Interest Rate Swap Agreements: GM uses both fair value and cash flow hedges, with changes in fair value directly impacting its financial expenses.",
        "Hop 2: HD \u2192 Interest Rate Swap Agreements: HD transitioned its swaps from LIBOR to SOFR and uses them primarily as cash flow hedges, with immaterial impacts on financials.",
        "Hop 3: LOW \u2192 Interest Rate Swap Agreements: LOW uses swaps as fair value hedges, but notes that interest rate risk is not material due to its fixed-rate debt structure."

      "question": "How do LOW, NKE, and SBUX each quantify or describe the impact of port congestion on their supply chain operations, and what does this reveal about their vulnerability to global logistics disruptions?",
      "answer": "LOW highlights that U.S. port congestion, along with other supply chain disruptions, has historically affected product flow and availability, particularly from China and Mexico, increasing costs and delivery times. NKE notes that port congestion and labor shortages have delayed product availability and increased transportation costs, at times forcing the company to use more expensive shipping methods like air freight. SBUX states that port congestion has contributed to delays in receiving key inputs such as coffee and dairy products, impacting inventory levels and increasing supply chain costs. Together, these perspectives show that all three companies face operational and financial risks from port congestion, though the specific products and geographies affected differ based on their respective supply chains.",

We source, stock, and sell products from domestic and international vendors, and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success. Catastrophic events, extreme weather conditions, public health crises, and global economic and political conditions may adversely affect our global supply chain. For example, impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic placed strains on the domestic and international supply chain, which negatively affected the flow and availability of our products in the past, due to difficulties in timely obtaining products from the manufacturers and suppliers of our products.\n\nWe source, both directly and indirectly, a portion of the products we sell from foreign manufacturers, with China and Mexico being the dominant import sources. Tax and trade policies, tariffs, and other regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries, such as China and Mexico, increase the cost of our merchandise sourced from outside of the United States, which represents a large percentage of our private branded and national brand merchandise. It remains unclear how tax or trade policies, tariffs, customs actions, or trade relations may evolve in the future, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, effective income tax rate, liquidity, and net income. In addition, other countries have responded by changing their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy and regulations already enacted or that may be enacted in the future. Complications in the free movement of goods in North America, an escalation of tariff activity elsewhere in the world or changes to existing free trade agreements, like the United StatesMexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), could adversely impact our financial results. Increased import tariffs and other changes in trade policy could also negatively impact consumer demand for the products we sell. In addition to the potential direct impacts of increased tariff activity, longer term macroeconomic consequences could result, including slower growth, inflation, and higher interest rates. The degree of our ex posure is dependent on, among other things, the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of tariffs. The impact to our business, including net sales and gross margin, will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nFinancial instability among key vendors, political instability, geopolitical or armed conflicts, and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain, changes in the total costs in our supply chain (including fuel), labor costs or labor shortages among our vendors, port labor disputes and security, the outbreak of pandemics, weather-related events, natural disasters, work stoppages, shipping capacity restraints, shipping delays and disruptions, changes in trade policy, retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the United States or a major source country, tariffs or duties, customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and ex clusions, fluctuations in transport availability, capacity, and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs. In recent years, U.S. ports have been impacted by capacity constraints, port congestion and delays, periodic labor disputes, security issues, weather-related events, and natural disasters.\n\nAdditionally, as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements, our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex  and operating it becomes more challenging. If our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, we experience delays in inventory, increased delivery costs, or merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence, and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nThe execution of initiatives to transform our supply chain network could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these investments might not provide the anticipated benefits.\n\nWe continue to transform and expand our supply chain network and existing omnichannel capabilities to meet changing customer needs. These investments are designed to promote greater network capacity and better flow management and optimization while leveraging a market delivery model. Failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. If we are unable to effectively manage the volume, timing, nature, location, and cost of these investments, projects, and changes, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. The cost and potential problems, defects of design, and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with implementing new technologies, restructuring support systems and processes, securing appropriate facility locations, addressing impacts on inventory levels, and managing thirdparty service providers, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and impact our profitability. Our investments to enhance and expand our supply chain might not provide the anticipated benefits, or might take longer than expected to complete or realize anticipated benefits, or might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.",

In particular, political and econom ic instability, geopolitical conflicts, political unrest, civil strife, terrorist activity, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation, nationalism  and other econom ic or political uncertainties in the U nited States or internationally could interrupt and negatively affect the sale of our products or other business operations. Any negative sentim ent toward the U nited States as a result of any such changes could also adversely affect our business.\n\nI n addition, terrorist acts, m ilitary conflict and disease outbreaks have increased the risks of doing business abroad. T hese factors, am ong others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure m aterials, or our costs for m anufacturing and procuring m aterials, our ability to im port products, our ability to sell products in international m arkets and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors m ake the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or im practical, our business could be adversely affected.\n\n## Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.\n\nThe principal m aterials used in our footwear products - natural and synthetic rubber, plastic com pounds, foam  cushioning m aterials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and natural fiber textiles and polyurethane film s - are locally available to m anufacturers. T he principal m aterials used in our apparel products - natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both virgin and recycled), specialized perform ance fabrics designed to efficiently wick m oisture away from  the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and m etal hardware - are also available in countries where our m anufacturing takes place. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our contract m anufacturers to locate, train, em ploy and retain adequate personnel. N IKE  contract m anufacturers and m aterials suppliers buy raw m aterials and are subject to wage rates and other labor standards that are oftentim es regulated by the governm ents of the countries in which our products are m anufactured.\n\nThere could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw m aterials from  current sources or, in the event of a disruption or heightened com petition for such m aterials, our contract m anufacturers m ight not be able to locate alternative suppliers of m aterials of com parable quality at an acceptable price or at all. F urther, our contract m anufacturers have experienced and m ay continue to experience in the future, unexpected closures, unexpected increases in work wages or other changes in labor standards, whether governm ent mandated or otherwise, and increases in com pliance costs due to governm ental regulation concerning certain m etals, fabrics or raw m aterials used in the m anufacturing of our products. In addition, we cannot be certain that m anufacturers that we do not contract and that we refer to as \"unaffiliated m anufacturers\" will be able to fill our orders in a tim ely manner. If we experience significant increases in dem and, or reductions in the availability of m aterials, or need to replace an existing contract m anufacturer or m aterials supplier, there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw m aterials or additional m anufacturing capacity will be available when required on term s acceptable to us, or at all, or that any contract m anufacturer, unaffiliated m anufacturer, or any m aterials supplier would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to m eet our requirem ents. E ven if we are able to expand existing or find new m anufacturing capacity or sources of m aterials, we m ay encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the tim e it takes to train suppliers and m anufacturers in our m ethods, products, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. In addition, changes we m ake in m anaging the supply of our products, such as changes to decrease the supply of certain products, pose the risk that we m ay not be able to m eet dem and for, or ram p up production of, certain products tim ely or without additional cost. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, in the supply of m aterials or in the m anufacturing of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to m eet retail custom er and consum er dem and for our products and result in lower revenues and net incom e both in the short- and long-term .\n\nBecause contract m anufacturers m ake a m ajority of our products outside of our principal sales m arkets, our products m ust be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. D elays in the shipm ent or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, container shortages, labor shortages, including work stoppages or port strikes, infrastructure and port congestion or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between m anufacturers, have adversely im pacted, and could in the future adversely im pact the availability of our products and, in turn, our financial perform ance. In addition, delays in the shipm ent or delivery of our products, m anufacturing delays or unexpected dem and for our products have required us, and m ay in the future require us to use faster, but m ore expensive, transportation m ethods such as air freight, which could adversely affect our profit m argins. T he cost of oil is a significant com ponent in m anufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum  products can adversely affect our profit m argins. C hanges in U .S. trade policies, including m odifications to im port tariffs and existing trade policies and agreem ents, have also had, and could continue to have a significant im pact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions, and could adversely affect our reputation or results of operations.\n\nI n addition, we have becom e, and expect to continue to be, subject to a num ber of regulations that require us to develop new policies and procedures for, strive to m itigate, and report, certain supply chain risks related to sourcing internationally. T hese regulations have resulted and m ay continue to result in increased operating costs and affect how and where we source m aterials for our products.",

      "question": "How do HD, LOW, and SBUX each quantify or describe the financial consequences of service quality issues, and what does this reveal about their relative exposure to operational risks in the consumer discretionary sector?",
      "answer": "HD highlights that service quality issues, particularly those related to supply chain disruptions and catastrophic events, could lead to increased costs, loss of property or inventory, and adversely affect revenue and profitability. LOW similarly emphasizes that service quality failures could damage its public image, reduce demand for its products and services, and negatively impact results of operations, particularly in terms of customer confidence and vendor relationships. SBUX underscores the financial risks tied to service quality through incidents like foodborne illnesses or supply chain failures, which could result in product recalls, litigation, and temporary store closures, directly harming sales and profitability. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies identify service quality issues as critical to financial performance, HD and LOW focus on supply chain and reputational risks, while SBUX emphasizes food safety and third-party partner risks as key financial vulnerabilities.",

      "answer": "GM utilizes interest rate swap agreements as both fair value hedges and cash flow hedges, with changes in fair value impacting Automotive interest expense and GM Financial interest, operating, and other expenses. HD uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its fixed/floating-rate debt portfolio, with $6.0 billion of floating-rate debt principal and a $795 million liability position in swaps as of February 2, 2025, and a one percentage point rate increase expected to raise interest expense by $60 million. SBUX enters into interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges, with gains or losses recorded in AOCI and reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt. Together, these approaches show GM's diversified hedging strategies across business units, HD's focus on liability management and interest rate exposure quantification, and SBUX's emphasis on forward-looking cash flow protection.",

Forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are evaluated for effectiveness using regression analysis at inception and throughout the hedge period.\n\nCertain receive-fix ed, pay-float interest rate swap agreements have been designated and qualify as fair value hedges of our fixed-rate debt. The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The changes in both the fair value of the hedged debt and the hedging instrument are recorded in Automotive interest expense. When a fair value hedge is de-designated, or when the derivative is terminated prior to maturity, the fair value adjustment to the hedged debt continues to be reported as part of the carrying value of the debt and is recognized in Automotive interest expense over its remaining life.\n\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial G M  Financial  utilizes  interest  rate  derivative  instruments  to  manage  interest  rate  risk  and  foreign  currency  derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk.  The change in fair value of the derivative instruments not designated as an accounting hedge is recorded in  GM Financial interest, operating and other ex penses.\n\nCertain interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as fair value hedges. The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate or the risk of changes in fair value attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the swap has been designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. The change in fair value of the related hedge is also recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nCertain interest rate swap and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges. The risk being hedged is the interest rate and foreign currency risk related to forecasted transactions. If the contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the cash flow hedge is deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is recognized in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses along with the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings.

During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill due to the use of preliminary information in our initial estimates. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n\n## MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES\n\nWe value the majority of our inv entory under the retail inv entory method, with the remainder of our inv entories v alued under a cost method, primarily the first-in, first-out method. Under the retail inv entory method, inv entories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail v alue of inv entories.\n\nThe retail v alue of our inv entory is adjusted as needed to reflect current market conditions. Because these adjustments are based on current prev ailing market conditions, the v alue of our inv entory approximates the lower of cost or market. The v aluation under the retail inv entory method is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inv entory losses (or shrink). As such, there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inv entory cost and gross profit. We determine markups and markdowns based on the consideration of a v ariety of factors such as current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and buying trends, age of the merchandise, and weather conditions.\n\nWe calculate shrink based on actual inv entory losses identified as a result of physical inv entory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inv entory losses occurring between physical inv entory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inv entory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. A 10% increase in the shrink rate used to estimate our inv entory shrink reserv e would hav e increased cost of sales by approximately $95 million for fiscal 2024. Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inv entory losses has not been material to our annual financial results.\n\nWe do not believ e there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to v alue our inv entory under the retail inv entory method. We believ e that the retail inv entory method prov ides an inv entory v aluation which approximates cost and results in v aluing our inv entory at the lower of cost or market.\n\n## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nFor information on our accounting policies and on accounting pronouncements that hav e impacted or may materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Item 7A . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures A bout Market Risk.\n\n## INTEREST RATE RISK\n\nWe have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our long-term debt portfolio. We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed/floating-rate debt portfolio, none of which are for trading or speculativ e purposes. At February 2, 2025, after giv ing consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, floating-rate debt principal was $6.0 billion, or approximately 12% of our senior notes portfolio. Our interest rate swap agreements were in an aggregate liability position of $795 million at February 2, 2025. The changes in the fair v alues of our interest rate swap agreements offset the changes in the fair v alue of the hedged long-term debt. Based on our February 2, 2025 floating-rate debt principal, a one percentage point increase in the interest rate of floating-rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $60 million.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK\n\nWe are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. We use deriv ativ e instruments to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk, none of which are for trading or speculativ e purposes. Our foreign currency related hedging arrangements outstanding at the end of fiscal 2024 were not material.",

The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2024. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued guidance expanding segment disclosure requirements. The amendments require enhanced disclosure for certain segment items and disclosure on how management uses reported measures to assess segment performance. The amendments do not change how segments are determined, aggregated, or how thresholds are applied to determine reportable segments. We expect to adopt the guidance for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2025. We are currently evaluating the expanded disclosure requirements and do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance expanding disclosure requirements related to income taxes. The amendments require enhanced jurisdictional disclosures for the income tax rate reconciliation and related to cash income tax es paid. Additionally, certain disclosures related to unrecognized tax  benefits and indefinite reinvestment assertions were removed. The amendments are effective for our fiscal year ending September 27, 2026. While we are still evaluating the specific impacts and timing of adoption, we anticipate this guidance will have a significant impact on our annual income tax disclosures.\n\nIn March 2024, the SEC issued its final climate disclosure rules, which require the disclosure of climate-related information in annual reports and registration statements. The rules require disclosure in the audited financial statements of certain effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions above certain financial thresholds, as well as amounts related to carbon offsets and renewable energy credits or certificates, if material. Under the rules as originally issued, disclosure requirements begin phasing in for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. However, on April 4, 2024, the SEC determined to voluntarily stay the final rules pending certain legal challenges. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new rules and continue to monitor the status of the related legal challenges.\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance expanding disclosure requirements related to certain income statement expenses. The amendments require tabular disclosure of certain operating expenses disaggregated into categories, such as purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization. The amendments are effective for our fiscal year ending October 1, 2028, and may be applied retrospectively. While we are still evaluating the specific impacts and adoption method, we anticipate this guidance will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n\n## Note 2:    Acquisitions, Div estitures, and Strategic Alliance\n\n## Fiscal 2023\n\nOn January 13, 2023, we sold the assets, primarily consisting of intellectual properties associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand, to Nestl\u00e9 for $110.0 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax  gain of $91.3 million, which was included in gain from sale of assets on our consolidated statement of earnings for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023. Results from Seattle's Best Coffee operations prior to the sale are reported in our Channel Development operating segment.\n\n## Fiscal 2022\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our Evolution Fresh brand and business to Bolthouse Farms. This transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 3:    Deriv ativ e Financial Instruments\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. We enter into interest rate swap agreements, including forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks, settled in cash based upon the difference between an agreed-upon benchmark rate and the prevailing benchmark rate at settlement. These agreements are generally settled around the time of the pricing of the related debt. Each derivative agreement's gain or loss is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt.\n\nTo hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges. The changes in fair values of these derivative instruments and the offsetting changes in fair",

      "question": "How do HD, LOW, and TSLA each structure the vesting schedules for their equity-based compensation programs, and what do these structures reveal about their differing approaches to long-term employee retention and performance incentives?",
      "answer": "HD structures its stock options to vest at 25% per year starting on the second anniversary of the grant, with early vesting possible upon associates reaching age 60 with five years of service. This suggests a focus on long-term tenure-based retention. LOW\u2019s restricted stock units generally vest 50% after two years and 50% after three years, with some vesting fully after three years, indicating a balanced approach between mid-term retention and performance alignment. TSLA\u2019s 2018 CEO Performance Award includes 12 vesting tranches tied to both market capitalization milestones and operational performance metrics, reflecting a highly performance-driven and milestone-based compensation strategy aimed at top executive accountability. Together, these approaches show HD favoring tenure-based vesting, LOW using time-based vesting with moderate flexibility, and TSLA aligning equity compensation closely with aggressive performance targets.",

Under the terms of the Plans, incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options must have an exercise price at or above the fair market value of our stock on the date of the grant. Typically, nonqualified stock options vest at the rate of 25% per year commencing on the second anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary date of the grant. Additionally, a majority of our stock options may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. No incentive stock options have been issued under the 2005 Plan.\n\nWe estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Our determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables.\n\nThe following table presents the per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted and the assumptions used in determining fair value at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model:\n\n",

We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.\n\n## 2018 CEO Performance Award\n\nIn March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors' grant of 101.3 million stock option awards, as adjusted to give effect to the five-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2020 ('Stock Split'), to our CEO (the '2018 CEO Performance Award'). The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at $100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0 billion thereafter (based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been achieved for the four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial statements filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of the exercise price of $70.01 per share, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five years post-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding.\n\nThe achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2021 is provided below. Although an operational milestone is deemed achieved in the last quarter of the relevant annualized period, it may be certified only after the financial statements supporting its achievement have been filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K.\n\n",

      "answer": "GM mentions its operations in Vietnam as part of a broader list of international regions, indicating a general presence but without specific detail on strategic importance or risk. HD explicitly states that it maintained sourcing offices in Vietnam during fiscal 2021, highlighting the country\u2019s role in its global sourcing strategy and emphasizing compliance and supplier accountability. NKE provides detailed data, showing that Vietnam accounted for 44% of its footwear and 26% of its apparel production in fiscal 2022, underscoring a high operational dependency and exposing significant risk exposure in the event of supply chain disruptions. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies operate in or source from Vietnam, NKE demonstrates the highest strategic dependency, HD emphasizes responsible sourcing, and GM presents a more generalized operational presence with less emphasis on the region's importance.",

As we continue to assess our performance throughout our regions, we may take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations, which may result in material asset write-downs or impairments and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. In addition, these restructuring actions subject us to increased risks of labor unrest or strikes, supplier, dealer, or other third-party litigation, regulator claims or proceedings, negative publicity  and  business  disruption.  Failure  to  realize  anticipated  savings  or  benefits  from  our  restructuring  and/or  cost  reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and cash flows.\n\n## Risks related to our intellectual property, cybersecurity, information technology and data management practices\n\nCompetitors  may  independently  develop  products  and  services  similar  to  ours,  and  there  are  no  guarantees  that  GM's intellectual  property  rights  would  prevent  competitors  from  independently  developing  or  selling  those  products  and  services. There may be instances where, notwithstanding our intellectual property position, competitive products or services may impact the value  of  our  brands  and  other  intangible  assets,  and  our  business  may  be  adversely  affected.  Moreover,  although  GM  takes reasonable  steps  to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of  GM  proprietary  information,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  such  efforts  will completely  deter  or  prevent  misappropriation  or  improper  use  of  our  intellectual  property.  We  sometimes  face  attempts  to  gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, we may be the target of patent enforcement actions by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. Although we have taken steps to mitigate such risks, if we are found to have infringed any third-party intellectual property rights, we could be required to  pay  substantial  damages,  or  we  could  be  enjoined  from  offering  some  of  our  products  and  services.  In  addition,  to  prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement, misappropriation or other violation  of  our  intellectual  property  against  third  parties. Any  such  action  could  result  in  significant  costs  and  diversion  of  our resources and management's attention, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any such action.\n\nSecurity  breaches  and  other  disruptions  to  information  technology  systems  and  networked  products,  including  connected vehicles,  owned  or  maintained  by  us,  GM  Financial,  or  third-parties,  such  as  vendors  or  suppliers,  could  interfere  with  our operations  and  could  compromise  the  confidentiality  of  private  customer  data  or  our  proprietary  information. We rely  upon information technology systems and manufacture networked and connected products, some of which are managed by third parties, to process,  transmit  and  store  electronic  information  and  to  manage  or  support  a  variety  of  our  business  processes,  activities  and products. Additionally, we and GM Financial collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary business information  (including  that  of  our  dealers  and  suppliers),  as  well  as  personally  identifiable  information  of  our  customers  and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks (including networks that may be controlled or maintained by third parties). The secure operation of these systems and products, and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these systems and products, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Further, customers using our systems rely on the security  of  our  infrastructure,  including  hardware  and  other  elements  provided  by  third  parties,  to  ensure  the  reliability  of  our products and the protection of their data. We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of  any  of  the  third  parties  that  facilitate  our  business  activities,  including  vendors,  service  providers,  suppliers,  customers, counterparties, exchanges, clearing agents, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties and other third parties who provide  us  services  or  with  whom  we  communicate  could  also  be  the  source  of  a  cyberattack  on,  or  breach  of,  our  operational systems, network, data or infrastructure. Despite our security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology systems  and  networked  and  connected  products  may  be  vulnerable  to  damage,  disruptions  or  shutdowns  caused  by  attacks  by hackers,  computer  viruses,  malware  (including  'ransomware'),  phishing  attacks  or  breaches  due  to  errors  or  malfeasance  by employees, contractors and others who have access to these systems and products. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise the confidentiality, operational integrity and accessibility of these systems and products and the data that resides within them.  Similarly,  such  an  occurrence  could  result  in  the  compromise  or  loss  of  the  information  processed  by  these  systems  and products.  Such  events  could  result  in,  among  other  things,  the  loss  of  proprietary  data,  interruptions  or  delays  in  our  business operations  and  damage  to  our  reputation.  In  addition,  such  events  could  increase  the  risk  of  claims  alleging  that  we  are  noncompliant with applicable laws or regulations, subjecting us to potential liability or regulatory penalties and related costs under laws protecting the privacy of personal information; disrupt our operations; or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies. Various events described above have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Although impacts of past events have been immaterial, the impacts of such events in the future may be material.\n\nSecurity  breaches  and  other  disruptions  of  our  in-vehicle  systems  could  impact  the  safety  of  our  customers  and  reduce confidence in GM and our products . Our vehicles contain complex information technology systems. These systems control various vehicle functions including engine, transmission, safety, steering, navigation, acceleration, braking, window, door lock functions and battery and electric motors.

We also provide tool and equipment rentals at over 1,400 locations across the U.S. and Canada, providing value and convenience for both Pros and consumers. To improve the customer experience and continue to grow this differentiated service offering, we are continuing to invest in more locations, more tools, and better technology.\n\nSourcing and Quality Assurance. We maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innovative products directly from manufacturers in the U.S. and around the world. During fiscal 2021, in addition to our U.S. sourcing operations, we maintained sourcing offices in Mexico, Canada, China, India, Vietnam and Europe. To ensure that suppliers adhere to our high standards of social and environmental responsibility, we also have a global responsible sourcing program. Under our supplier contracts, our suppliers are obligated to ensure that their products comply with applicable international, federal, state and local laws. These contracts also require compliance with our responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, health and safety, environment, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. To drive accountability with our suppliers, our standard supplier buying agreement includes a factory audit right related to these standards, and we conduct factory audits and compliance visits with our suppliers of private branded and direct import products. Our 2021 Responsible Sourcing Report, available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility/sourcing-responsibility, provides more information about this program. In addition, we have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to establishing criteria and overseeing compliance with safety, quality and performance standards for our private branded products.\n\nIntellectual Property. Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, ecommerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business, including our proprietary brands such as HDX , Husky , Hampton Bay , Home Decorators Collection , Glacier Bay , Vigoro , Everbilt and Lifeproof . The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nWe also maintain patent portfolios relating to our business operations, retail services and products and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our business. Patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential to our business. We continuously assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within The Home Depot's portfolio of proprietary and exclusive brands.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nOur industry is highly competitive, very fragmented, and evolving. As a result, we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer bases, and service providers, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online. These competitors include a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO distributors, home d\u00e9cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. The internet facilitates competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the level of competition we face.\n\nWe compete primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, product availability and assortment, and delivery options, both in-store and online. We also compete based on store location and appearance, presentation of merchandise, and ease of shopping experience. Furthermore, with respect to delivery options, customers are increasingly seeking faster and/or guaranteed delivery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or convenient pickup options, including curbside pickup. Our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including the success of our supply chain investments, described more fully under 'Our Supply Chain' below.\n\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, and the lowest volume occurs either during our first or fourth fiscal quarter.",

For fiscal 2022, two apparel contract manufacturers each accounted for more than 10% of apparel production, and the top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 54% of NIKE Brand apparel production.\n\nNIKE's contract manufacturers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased by those contract manufacturers in the countries where manufacturing takes place.\n\nThe principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and natural fiber textiles, as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2022, Air Manufacturing Innovation, a wholly-owned subsidiary, with facilities near Beaverton, Oregon, in Dong Nai Province, Vietnam, and St. Charles, Missouri, as well as contract manufacturers in China and Vietnam, were our suppliers of NIKE AirSole cushioning components used in footwear.\n\nThe principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both virgin and recycled); specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, COVID-19 had impacts throughout our supply chain, including loss of production as well as production and transportation delays. However, COVID-19 has not materially impacted the number or concentration of finished goods factories, contract manufacturers, or Tier 2 suppliers in countries where we source footwear and apparel products. Despite competition for certain materials during fiscal 2022, contract manufacturers were able to source sufficient quantities of raw materials for use in our footwear and apparel products. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, for additional discussion of the impact of COVID-19 and sourcing risks on our business.\n\nSince 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America ('Sojitz America'), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed import-export financing services for us.\n\n## INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE\n\nOur international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as the implementation of, or potential changes in, foreign and domestic trade policies, increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political tensions, instability, conflicts, nationalism and terrorism, and resulting sanctions and other measures imposed in response to such issues. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future.\n\nIn recent years, uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and, in nearly all cases, we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional measures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE, as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole.\n\nWe monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional antidumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. NIKE also advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements. Changes in, and responses to, U.S. trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs or penalties on imported goods or retaliatory measures by other countries, have negatively affected, and could in the future negatively affect, U.S. corporations, including NIKE, with business operations and/or consumer markets in those countries, which could also make it necessary for us to change the way we conduct business, either of which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or our results of operations. In addition, with respect to proposed trade restrictions, we work with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 4",

          "chunk_text": "which have shown volatility and long-term deceleration of growth rates, may also impact growth rates for marketing channels. Any deterioration in our marketing efficiency could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, whether through reduced revenues or revenue growth, or through marketing expenses increasing faster than revenues, which would reduce margins and earnings growth.\n\nMany factors could cause consumers to increase their shopping activity before making a travel purchase. Increased shopping activity impedes our marketing efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes less likely to result in a reservation through our platforms, and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid marketing channels than through direct channels. Further, consumers may favor travel services offered by search or meta-search companies over OTCs, which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation platforms, increase consumer awareness of our competitors' brands and platforms, increase our marketing and other customer acquisition costs, and adversely affect our business, margins, and results of operations. To the extent any such increased shopping behavior leads to growth in our KAYAK meta-search business, such growth may not result in sufficient increases in revenues from our KAYAK meta-search business to offset any related decrease in revenues or increase in marketing and other customer acquisition costs experienced by our OTC brands.\n\nWe may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market changes.\n\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, consolidation, frequent new service announcements, introductions and enhancements, and changing consumer demands and preferences. These characteristics are changing at an even greater pace as OTCs and travel service providers seek to address consumer needs and preferences resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We may not be able to keep up with these rapid changes. In addition, these market characteristics are heightened by the progress of technology adoption in various markets, including the continuing adoption of the internet and online commerce in certain geographies and the growth of the use of smartphones, tablets, and other smart devices for mobile e-commerce transactions. New developments in other areas such as cloud computing could make entering our markets easier for competitors due to lower upfront technology costs. It is increasingly important for us to effectively offer our services on mobile devices through mobile apps and mobile-optimized websites and to tailor our services to varying devices and platforms. See below Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \" Consumer adoption and use of mobile devices creates challenges and may enable device companies such as Google and Apple to compete directly with us .\" Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt our services and online platforms to evolving industry standards and local preferences, and to continually innovate and improve the performance, features, and reliability of our services and online platforms in response to competitive service offerings and the evolving demands of the marketplace.\n\nAdditionally, our ability to achieve our long-term strategy to build the Connected Trip depends on successfully integrating and developing new and evolving technologies, which will require increased financial and personnel investments that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations until we achieve the expected return on these investments. While we believe that we have the ability to achieve our long-term strategy to build the Connected Trip, the development of the Connected Trip is subject to uncertainties, including further technical development of the flight, accommodation, and other verticals necessary for the Connected Trip experience, the ability to collect, store, and use customer data in a compliant and integrated fashion, and the attraction and retention of employees dedicated to this development effort. As a result, it may take longer than we expect to build the Connected Trip or it may not achieve the expected return on investment. Consumer demand for the Connected Trip may also not be sustained at the levels that we anticipate. These efforts may also not be successful in improving the travel experience or retaining and attracting new customers. Further, regulatory authorities may subject us to existing or new rules or restrictions that could prevent us from successfully commercializing the Connected Trip or expose us to unanticipated claims or liabilities. With any technical innovation such as the Connected Trip effort, there could be bugs, vulnerabilities and other system failures, which could result in lost business, harm to our brand or reputation, consumer complaints and other adverse consequences, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nWe are working toward enhancing our payments capabilities, including by offering alternative payment solutions to consumers even when those payment solutions may not be accepted by the travel service provider or restaurant. Alternate payment providers such as Alipay, Paytm, and WeChat Pay operate closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both consumers and merchants. In many markets, particularly in Asia where credit cards are not readily available and/or e-commerce is largely carried out through mobile devices, these and other emerging alternative payment methods are the exclusive or preferred means of payment for many consumers. If we are unable to offer consumers their preferred method of payment by integrating new or emerging payment methods into our platforms, we may not be able to effectively offer our services to these consumers, which would limit our growth opportunities in these markets and our business and results of operations could be harmed.",

If we or our franchisees are unable to adequately staff McDonald's restaurants, it could negatively impact our operations, including speed of service to customers, and customer satisfaction levels. The System's ability to meet its labor needs is generally subject to external factors, including the availability of sufficient workforce, unemployment levels and prevailing wages in the markets in which we operate.\n\nFurther, increased costs and competition associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified employees, as well as costs associated with promoting awareness of the opportunities of working at McDonald's restaurants, could have a negative impact on our Companyoperated margins and our franchisees' profitability.\n\nWe are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and international regulations affecting our workforce, which includes our staff and employees working in our Company-operated restaurants. These regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues, including wage and hour, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. Claims of noncompliance with these regulations could result in liability and expense to us. Our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers, including those giving rise to claims of harassment or discrimination (or perceptions thereof) or workplace safety, could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. Additionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to recruit, motivate and retain talent) or our franchisees and suppliers, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results.\n\n## Effective succession planning is important to our continued success.\n\nEffective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Failure to effectively identify, develop and retain key personnel, recruit high-quality candidates and ensure smooth management and personnel transitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results.\n\n## Food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.\n\nOur ability to increase sales and profits depends on our System's ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonald's of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future, including in the supply chain, restaurants or delivery. Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe food products, including as our menu and service model evolve. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, occur within the food industry and our System from time to time and could occur in the future. Instances of food tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our brand and reputation, as well as our financial results.\n\n## If we do not effectively manage our real estate portfolio, our operating results may be negatively impacted.\n\nWe have significant real estate operations, primarily in connection with our restaurant business. We generally own or secure a long-term lease on the land and building for conventional franchised and Company-operated restaurant sites. We seek to identify and develop restaurant locations that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential. As we generally secure long-term real estate interests for our restaurants, we have limited flexibility to quickly alter our real estate portfolio. The competitive business landscape continues to evolve in light of changing business trends, consumer preferences, trade area demographics, consumer use of digital, delivery and drive thru, local competitive positions and other economic factors. If our restaurants are not located in desirable locations, or if we do not evolve in response to these factors, it could adversely affect Systemwide sales and profitability.\n\nOur real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate operations are also impacted by a variety of other factors, including governmental regulations, insurance, zoning, tax and eminent domain laws, interest rate levels and the cost of financing. A significant change in real estate values, or an increase in costs as a result of any of these factors, could adversely affect our operating results.\n\n## Information technology system failures or interruptions, or breaches of network security, may impact our operations or cause reputational harm.\n\nWe are increasingly reliant upon technology systems, such as point-of-sale, technologies that support our digital and delivery solutions, and technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration with affiliated entities, customers, employees, franchisees, suppliers, service providers or other independent third parties to conduct our business, whether developed and maintained by us or provided by third parties. Any failure or interruption of these systems could significantly impact our or our franchisees' operations, or our customers' experience and perceptions.\n\nSecurity incidents or breaches have from time to time occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the systems of the parties we communicate or collaborate with (including franchisees) or the systems of third-party providers. These may include such things as unauthorized access, phishing attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Certain of these technology systems contain personal, financial and other information of our customers, employees, franchisees, business customers and other third parties, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. Despite response procedures and measures in place in the event of an incident, a security breach could result in disruptions, shutdowns, or the theft or unauthorized disclosure of such information. The actual or alleged occurrence of any of these incidents could result in mitigation costs, reputational damage, adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk, including criminal penalties or civil liabilities.\n\nWe also provide certain technology systems to businesses that are unaffiliated with the McDonald's System and a failure, interruption or breach of these systems may cause harm to those unaffiliated parties, which may result in liability to us or reputational harm.",

Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and compromise information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. We continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.\n\n- We rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, Starbucks Cards, online business, delivery services, mobile technology, including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions, and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality. Additionally, the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our ability to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, is highly dependent on our technology systems. Furthermore, due to the social distancing measures put in place as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated the transformation of our store portfolio by expanding convenience-led formats, which depend heavily on our mobile ordering capabilities. We also rely on third-party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. Additionally, our systems hardware, software and services provided by third-party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. Although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. Such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, climate changerelated impacts, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or third-party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our third-party business partners' or service providers' systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section. If our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective and timely manner, they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n- We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of our brand and our business.\n\nThe success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products.\n\nWe have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, and the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business. In addition, we cannot ensure that licensees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property.\n\n## Risks Related to Supply Chain\n\n- Our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations.\n\nThe growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations as well as on the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop and negotiate appropriate terms and",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Competition\n\nOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including onpremises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers' ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth's most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,608,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for personnel across other parts of our business.\n\nAs we strive to be Earth's best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and develop the best talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (funded education for hourly employees) and the Amazon Technical Academy (software development engineer training). We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.",

We also provide tool and equipment rentals at over 1,400 locations across the U.S. and Canada, providing value and convenience for both Pros and consumers. To improve the customer experience and continue to grow this differentiated service offering, we are continuing to invest in more locations, more tools, and better technology.\n\nSourcing and Quality Assurance. We maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innovative products directly from manufacturers in the U.S. and around the world. During fiscal 2021, in addition to our U.S. sourcing operations, we maintained sourcing offices in Mexico, Canada, China, India, Vietnam and Europe. To ensure that suppliers adhere to our high standards of social and environmental responsibility, we also have a global responsible sourcing program. Under our supplier contracts, our suppliers are obligated to ensure that their products comply with applicable international, federal, state and local laws. These contracts also require compliance with our responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, health and safety, environment, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. To drive accountability with our suppliers, our standard supplier buying agreement includes a factory audit right related to these standards, and we conduct factory audits and compliance visits with our suppliers of private branded and direct import products. Our 2021 Responsible Sourcing Report, available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility/sourcing-responsibility, provides more information about this program. In addition, we have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to establishing criteria and overseeing compliance with safety, quality and performance standards for our private branded products.\n\nIntellectual Property. Our business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, ecommerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for registration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business, including our proprietary brands such as HDX , Husky , Hampton Bay , Home Decorators Collection , Glacier Bay , Vigoro , Everbilt and Lifeproof . The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\nWe also maintain patent portfolios relating to our business operations, retail services and products and seek to patent or otherwise protect innovations we incorporate into our business. Patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential to our business. We continuously assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within The Home Depot's portfolio of proprietary and exclusive brands.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nOur industry is highly competitive, very fragmented, and evolving. As a result, we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer bases, and service providers, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online. These competitors include a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO distributors, home d\u00e9cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental. The internet facilitates competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the level of competition we face.\n\nWe compete primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, product availability and assortment, and delivery options, both in-store and online. We also compete based on store location and appearance, presentation of merchandise, and ease of shopping experience. Furthermore, with respect to delivery options, customers are increasingly seeking faster and/or guaranteed delivery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or convenient pickup options, including curbside pickup. Our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including the success of our supply chain investments, described more fully under 'Our Supply Chain' below.\n\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, and the lowest volume occurs either during our first or fourth fiscal quarter.",

Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and compromise information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. We continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.\n\n- We rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, Starbucks Cards, online business, delivery services, mobile technology, including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions, and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality. Additionally, the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our ability to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, is highly dependent on our technology systems. Furthermore, due to the social distancing measures put in place as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated the transformation of our store portfolio by expanding convenience-led formats, which depend heavily on our mobile ordering capabilities. We also rely on third-party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. Additionally, our systems hardware, software and services provided by third-party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. Although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. Such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, climate changerelated impacts, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or third-party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our third-party business partners' or service providers' systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section. If our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective and timely manner, they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n- We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of our brand and our business.\n\nThe success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products.\n\nWe have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, and the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business. In addition, we cannot ensure that licensees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property.\n\n## Risks Related to Supply Chain\n\n- Our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations.\n\nThe growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations as well as on the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop and negotiate appropriate terms and",

MCD holds $451 million in certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2024, which is a significant portion of its $1.1 billion in cash and equivalents, suggesting a more aggressive allocation to this low-risk, short-term instrument. TSLA includes certificates of deposit among its Level II fair value investments, though specific dollar amounts are not disclosed, implying a more diversified approach to short-term liquidity that includes digital assets and government securities alongside CDs. This comparison reveals that MCD places a heavier emphasis on CDs for liquidity and risk management, while LOW uses them more modestly and TSLA integrates them into a broader portfolio of short-term and digital investments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Net Investment Hedges\n\nThe Company uses foreign currency denominated debt (third-party and intercompany) and foreign currency derivatives to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders' equity in the foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") and offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in OCI. A s of December 31, 2024, $13.1 billion of the Company's third-party foreign currency denominated debt, $168 million of the Company's intercompany foreign currency denominated debt and $1.9 billion of foreign currency derivatives were designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.\n\n## Undesignated Hedges\n\nThe Company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. Therefore, the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings together with the gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. A s an example, the Company enters into equity derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. The Company may also use certain investments to hedge changes in these liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives or investments are recorded in Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in non-operating (income) expense, net, along with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2024 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. For financial reporting purposes, the Company presents gross derivative balances in its financial statements and supplementary data, including for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. A t December 31, 2024, the Company was required to post $21 million of collateral due to the negative fair value of certain derivative positions.\n\n## SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nThe Company has a share-based compensation plan, which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units ('RSUs') to employees and nonemployee directors.\n\nShare-based compensation, which includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value, is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses.\n\nThe fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company's stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. In addition, the Company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized each period.\n\nThe fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company's stock at date of grant. For performance-based RSUs, the Company includes a relative Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a M onte Carlo valuation model.\n\nRefer to the Share-based Compensation footnote on page 63 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION\n\nDiluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares): 2024-3.6; 2023-4.4; 2022-4.8. Share-based compensation awards that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutiv e were (in millions of shares): 2024-1.9; 2023-2.0; 2022-1.5.\n\n## CASH AND EQUIVALENTS\n\nThe Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. A s of December 31, 2024, Cash and equivalents was $1.1 billion of which $451 million consisted of certificates of deposit.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2024 Annual R eport 51",

We have our BOSS, BOPIS, BODFS and direct fulfillment delivery options, but we cannot guarantee that these or future programs will be maintained and implemented successfully or that we will be able to meet customer expectations on delivery or pickup times, options and costs.\n\nIn addition, a greater concentration of online sales with direct fulfillment or curbside pickup could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-selling of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our overall sales and adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nFailure to provide a relevant or effective online customer experience in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations; to maintain appropriate inventory; to provide quick and low-price or free delivery alternatives and convenient pickup options; to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups; to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment; or to otherwise timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.\n\nA positive brand and reputation are critical to our business success, and, if our brand and reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers, associates, suppliers, vendors, and shareholders, and, consequently, our business and results of operations or the price of our stock.\n\nOur brand and reputation are critical to attracting customers, associates, suppliers and vendors to do business with us. We must continue to manage and protect our brand and reputation. Negative incidents can erode trust and confidence quickly, and adverse publicity about us could damage our brand and reputation, undermine our customers' confidence, reduce demand for our products and services, affect our ability to recruit, engage, motivate and retain associates, attract regulatory scrutiny, and impact our relationships with current and potential suppliers and vendors. Further, our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, political, public policy, economic, geopolitical, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation with certain groups. Customers are also increasingly using social media to provide feedback and information about our Company, including our products and services, in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. Negative sentiment about the Company shared over social media could impact our brand and reputation, whether or not it is based in fact.\n\nThe execution of initiatives to expand our supply chain and enhance the interconnected shopping experience could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.\n\nWe continue to invest in our interconnected retail strategy, including by making significant investments to expand our supply chain. These investments are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high-quality service to our customers; simplify customer interactions; provide our customers with a more interconnected shopping experience; and create the fastest, most efficient delivery network for home improvement products. Failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. Executing our interconnected retail strategy requires continual investment in our operations and information technology systems, as well as the development and execution of new processes, systems and support. Building out our supply chain also involves significant real estate projects as we expand our distribution network, requiring us to identify and secure available locations with appropriate characteristics needed to support the different types of facilities. If we are unable to effectively manage the volume, timing, nature, location, and cost of these investments, projects and changes, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. The cost and potential problems, defects of design, and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers, employing new web-based tools and services, implementing new technologies, implementing and restructuring support systems and processes, securing appropriate facility locations, and addressing impacts on inventory levels, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term, lead to product availability issues, and impact our profitability.\n\nIn addition, our stores are a key element of our interconnected retail strategy, serving as the hub of our customers' interconnected shopping experience.

          "chunk_text": "## OPERATIONS\n\n## The global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business.\n\nWe encounter differing cultural, regulatory, geopolitical and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries where McDonald's restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the System's success in these environments. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our System's ability to leverage operating successes across markets and brand perceptions. Planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with McDonald's customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts.\n\nDisruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or changes in trade-related tariffs or controls, sanctions and counter sanctions, government-mandated closure of our, our franchisees' or our suppliers' operations, and asset seizures. Trade policies, tariffs and other regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries could adversely affect our business and operations. These and other government actions may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm. Our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brand-building initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental actions.\n\nAdditionally, there are challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. In many cases, such challenges may be exacerbated by the lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainty in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. An inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\nWe may also face challenges and uncertainties in developed markets. For example, the U.K.'s exit from the European Union has caused increased regulatory complexities and uncertainty in European economic conditions and may also cause uncertainty in worldwide economic conditions. The decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may or may not continue, and may result in increased supply chain costs for items that are imported from other countries. Any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n## Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.\n\nWe depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient supply of quality products on favorable terms. Although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain products have limited suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions and related price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such interruptions and price increases could be caused by shortages, unexpected increases in demand, transportation issues, labor issues, weather-related events, natural disasters or other factors beyond the control of us or our suppliers or franchisees. If we experience interruptions in our System's supply chain, or if contingency planning is not effective, our costs could increase and/or the availability of products critical to our System's operations could be limited.\n\n## Our franchise business model presents a number of risks.\n\nOur success as a heavily franchised business relies to a large degree on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, including our developmental licensees and affiliates. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-operated restaurants. Our franchisees and developmental licensees manage their businesses independently and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. Business risks affecting our operations also affect our franchisees. In particular, our franchisees have also been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the volatility associated with the pandemic. If franchisee sales trends worsen or volatility persists, our financial results could be negatively affected, which may be material.\n\nOur success also relies on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, value/promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general, by their or our creditworthiness or by banks' lending practices. If our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brand's image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\n\nOur ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. The benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depend on various factors including whether we have effectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or affiliates that meet our rigorous standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Risks Related to Brand Relevance and Brand Execution\n\n- Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\nWe believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social and environmental impact programs. The Starbucks brand is recognized throughout most of the world, and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. To be successful in the future, particularly outside of the U.S. where the Starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities.\n\nBusiness incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value, potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results. Such incidents include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws, contaminated food, product recalls, store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases, such as COVID-19, safety-related incidents or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section. The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation. Consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we, our employees, licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased, unequal or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of customers at Starbucks stores, treatment of employees or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes. Furthermore, if we are not effective in addressing our social and environmental program goals, executing on our Reinvention Plan, or achieving relevant sustainability goals, consumer trust in our brand may suffer, and this perception could result in negative publicity or litigation. Additionally, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations, take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well or to foster an inclusive and diverse environment, our brand value may be diminished.\n\nThe ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our social and environmental program goals as well as the success of the Reinvention Plan, which requires company-wide coordination and alignment. We are working to manage risks and costs to us, our licensees and our supply chain of any effects of climate change as well as diminishing energy and water resources. These risks include any increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, including packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. These risks may also include any increased pressure to make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks.\n\n- We may not be successful in our marketing, promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategies.\n\nOur continued success depends in part on our ability to adjust our marketing, promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategy to respond quickly and effectively to shifting economic and competitive conditions as well as evolving customer preferences. We operate in a complex and costly marketing, promotional and advertising environment. Our marketing, promotional and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching our customers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising, promotional and marketing resources across different channels, including digital marketing, allows us to reach our customers effectively and efficiently, and in ways that are meaningful to them. If the advertising, promotional and marketing programs or our pricing strategies are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales and market share could decrease.\n\nFinally, customers are focusing more on sustainability and the environmental impacts of operations. An inability to meet customer expectations with respect to these issues could adversely affect our financial results.\n\n## Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy\n\n- Failure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protections laws and regulations may subject us to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties.\n\nComplex local, state, national, foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. These privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations and enforcement. In addition, our legal and regulatory obligations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to unexpected changes, including the potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations or to increase penalties",

Stock Incentive Plan, which authorizes the issuance of up to 798 million shares of Class B Common Stock for equity awards, including stock appreciation rights. These rights are administered by a Board committee and generally vest ratably over 4 years. SBUX maintains several equity incentive plans that allow for the granting of stock appreciation rights, though stock options have not been broadly used in recent years, with a focus on RSUs and performance-based metrics such as earnings per share and return on invested capital. TSLA includes stock appreciation rights under its 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, which allows for the grant of various equity instruments, with stock options and RSUs typically vesting over four years. As of December 31, 2024, 113.0 million shares were reserved and available for issuance under the 2019 Plan.

See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type, and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily include expenses related to raw materials, purchased goods, packaging, and delivery, along with operational costs of our supply chain organization. This encompasses wages, benefits, occupancy costs, and depreciation associated with sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Additionally, it includes costs related to inventory and supply chain asset impairments.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions, and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees, and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation",

As of January 31, 2025, the maximum number of nonvested units that could vest under the provisions of the agreements was 0.9 million. 1\n\n## Restricted Stock Units\n\nRestricted stock units do not have dividend rights and are valued at the market price of a share of the Company's common stock on the date of grant less the present value of dividends expected during the requisite service period.  In general, these awards vest ratably over a three-year period from the date of grant. Certain awards vest 50% at the end of a two-year period from the date of grant and 50% at the end of a three-year period from the date of grant, or vest 100% at the end of a three-year period from the date of grant. All awards are ex pensed on a straight-line basis over that period, which is considered to be the requisite service period.  The Company uses historical data to estimate the timing and amount of forfeitures.  The weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of restricted stock units granted was $236.96, $188.22, and $192.46 in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Substantially all of the options become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning a year from the date of the grant, and generally expire 10 years from the grant date.\n\nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for the 2024, 2023 and 2022 stock option grants.

Expected stock price volatility  is generally  based on the historical v olatility  of the Company 's stock for a period approx imating the ex pected life.

      "answer": "BKNG formally adopted a dividend policy in January 2024, declaring a $8.75 per share quarterly dividend shortly thereafter, signaling a new commitment to returning capital to shareholders. MCD has maintained a consistent dividend policy with 48 consecutive years of dividend payments through 2023, and has historically increased the dividend annually, reflecting a strong, long-standing commitment. SBUX continues to maintain a discretionary dividend policy, with future decisions dependent on operating performance, financial condition, and capital needs, without a stated history of consecutive increases or formal policy. Together, this reveals that while all three companies prioritize shareholder returns, they differ in the formality, consistency, and discretion applied to their dividend strategies.",

      "question": "How do GM, Nike, and Tesla differ in their inventory valuation methodologies, and what do these differences indicate about their respective approaches to managing inventory risk?",
      "answer": "General Motors (GM) indirectly addresses inventory risk through its credit risk monitoring of dealers, particularly those with III and IV risk ratings, which are subject to additional restrictions like credit suspension and asset liquidation. This suggests a focus on receivables and dealer-level financial controls rather than direct inventory valuation adjustments. Nike values its inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value, using either an average or specific identification cost basis, with costs including supplier product costs, freight, duties, and logistics fees. This approach emphasizes cost accuracy and traceability. Tesla uses a standard cost method that approximates FIFO for vehicles and energy storage products, with actual cost for solar systems, and explicitly accounts for inventory write-downs based on demand forecasts and net realizable value assessments. Tesla\u2019s method reflects a proactive stance on inventory risk, incorporating forward-looking assumptions about future sales and production costs. Collectively, these approaches reveal distinct risk management priorities: GM focuses on receivables and dealer credit, Nike emphasizes cost transparency, and Tesla prioritizes forward-looking inventory write-downs based on market and production dynamics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GM \u2192 Inventory Valuation: GM does not directly disclose inventory valuation methods but highlights credit risk monitoring for dealers, particularly those with III and IV risk ratings, indicating an indirect approach to inventory-related financial risk.",
        "Hop 2: NKE \u2192 Inventory Valuation: Nike explicitly states that inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, using average or specific identification methods, with detailed cost components including freight, duties, and logistics.",
        "Hop 3: TSLA \u2192 Inventory Valuation: Tesla uses standard cost (approximating FIFO) for vehicles and energy storage, and actual cost for solar systems, with explicit write-downs based on demand forecasts and net realizable value assessments."

          "chunk_text": "## CASH AND EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, with maturities three months or less at the date of purchase.\n\n## SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS\n\nShort-term investments consist of highly liquid investments with maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase. At May 31, 2022 and 2021, Short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale debt securities, which are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), unless unrealized losses are determined to be unrecoverable. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale debt securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and, therefore, classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond three months at the date of purchase as current assets within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nRefer to Note 6 - Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Company's Short-term investments.\n\n## ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\n\nAccounts receivable, net consist primarily of amounts due from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In addition to judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses, as well as macroeconomic and industry trends to determine the amount of the allowance. Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $34 million and $93 million as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n## INVENTORY VALUATION\n\nInventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value and valued on either an average or a specific identification cost basis. In some instances, the Company ships products directly from its suppliers to the customer, with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis. Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Company's suppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance, logistics and other handling fees.\n\n## PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for land improvements, buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years.\n\nDepreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales. Depreciation and amortization of all other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense.\n\n## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS\n\nExpenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over 2 to 12 years on a straight-line basis. The Company's policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. The Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.\n\nDevelopment costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established; therefore, software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally, most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 64",

          "chunk_text": "## MyPower Customer Notes Receivable\n\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $299 million and $334 million, respectively, of which $11 million and $9 million were due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the allowance for expected credit losses was $41 million and $45 million, respectively.\n\n## Concentration of Risk\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, accounts receivable, convertible note hedges, and interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the U.S. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, no entity represented 10% or more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our convertible note hedges and interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly-rated multinational banks.\n\n## Supply Risk\n\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n\n## Operating Lease Vehicles\n\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated depreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $5.28 billion and $3.54 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $773 million and $446 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Digital Assets, Net\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we purchased an aggregate of $1.50 billion in bitcoin (a \"digital asset\") and briefly accepted bitcoin as a payment for sales of certain of our products in specified regions, subject to applicable laws. We account for such non-cash consideration at the time we enter into transactions with our customers in accordance with the non-cash consideration guidance included in the Accounting Standards Codification ('ASC') 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , based on the then current quoted market prices of the digital assets.",

      "answer": "HD highlights that supply chain disruptions have led to increased transportation and fulfillment costs, impacting profitability and financial condition. LOW notes that global health crises and geopolitical conflicts have historically disrupted its supply chain, affecting product flow and availability. NKE emphasizes that forecasting inaccuracies and supply chain delays have resulted in inventory imbalances, harming operating margins and brand image. Together, these perspectives reveal that HD faces cost pressures, LOW is exposed to macro-level risks, and NKE struggles with internal forecasting and brand-related fallout from supply issues.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Competition\n\nOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including onpremises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers' ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth's most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,608,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for personnel across other parts of our business.\n\nAs we strive to be Earth's best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and develop the best talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (funded education for hourly employees) and the Amazon Technical Academy (software development engineer training). We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.",

          "chunk_text": "Furthermore, in the future the competitive pressure to innovate could encompass a wider range of services and technologies, including services and technologies that may be outside of our historical core business, and our ability to keep pace may slow. Our current and potential competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Emerging startups may be able to innovate and focus on developing a particularly new product or service faster than we can or may foresee consumer need for new services or technologies before we do. Some of our competitors have more resources or more established or varied relationships with consumers than we have, and they could use these advantages in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, entering or investing in travel reservation businesses, investing in research and development, and competing aggressively for highly-skilled employees.\n\nIn addition, the widespread adoption of new internet, networking, or telecommunications technologies, such as smart home devices, artificial intelligence, chatbot, virtual reality technologies, and the creation of \"super-apps\" could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure to these new technologies, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. We are in the early stages of a multi-year phased migration to integrate and upgrade certain cross-brand global financial systems and processes. The implementation of new information technology, payment, enterprise resource planning (ERP), or other systems could be disruptive and/or costly or we may experience difficulty successfully integrating new systems into existing systems or migrating to new systems from existing systems, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any failure to implement or adapt to new technologies in a timely manner or at all could adversely affect our ability to compete, increase our consumer acquisition costs or otherwise adversely affect our business, brand, market share, and results of operations.\n\nOur business could be negatively affected by changes in online search and meta-search algorithms and dynamics or traffic-generating arrangements.\n\nWe use Google to generate a significant portion of traffic to our platforms and, to a lesser extent, we use other search and meta-search services to generate traffic to our platforms, principally through pay-per-click marketing campaigns. The pricing and operating dynamics on these search and meta-search platforms can experience rapid change commercially, technically, and competitively. For example, Google frequently updates and changes the logic which determines the placement and display of results of a consumer's search, such that the placement of links to our platforms can be negatively affected and our costs to improve or maintain our placement in search results can increase. The European Commission has fined Google significant amounts for anticompetitive behavior relating to its comparison-shopping service and online search advertising services. Changes by Google in how it presents travel search results, including promotion of its own travel meta-search services, amounts charged to travel partners for referrals, or the manner in which it conducts the auction for placement among search results may be competitively disadvantageous to us, may increase our costs, and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our platforms, which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business, market share, and results of operations. Google recently modified its hotel price-comparison search tool to display prices for accommodation and booking providers for free, following a similar change it made to Google Flights. In addition, a decline or slowing growth in travel search traffic negatively impacts our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our platforms through performance marketing on general search platforms, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nWe purchase online traffic from a number of other sources, including some operated by our competitors, in the form of pay-per-click arrangements that can be terminated with little or no notice. If one or more of such arrangements is terminated, our business, market share, and results of operations could be adversely affected. We rely on various third-party distribution channels (i.e., marketing affiliates) to distribute accommodation, rental car, and airline ticket reservations. Should one or more of such third parties cease distribution of reservations made through us, or suffer deterioration in its search or meta-search ranking, due to changes in search or meta-search algorithms or otherwise, our business, market share, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nConsumer adoption and use of mobile devices creates challenges and may enable device companies such as Google and Apple to compete directly with us.\n\nWidespread adoption of mobile devices, such as the iPhone and Android-enabled smartphones, coupled with the web browsing functionality and development of thousands of apps available on these devices, continues to drive substantial online traffic and commerce to mobile platforms. We have experienced a significant shift of business, both direct and indirect, to mobile platforms and our advertising partners are also seeing a rapid shift of traffic to mobile platforms. The revenues earned on a mobile transaction may be less than a typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing patterns. For example, accommodation reservations made on a mobile device typically are for shorter lengths of stay, have lower ADRs, and are not made as far in advance. To the extent mobile devices or platforms enable users to block advertising content, our advertising revenue and our ability to market our brands and acquire new consumers may also be negatively affected. Given the device sizes and technical limitations of smartphones, mobile consumers may not be willing to download multiple apps from",

Some or all of our international market business units ('MBUs'), which we generally define by the countries in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. The performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large MBUs operate. A decline in performance of one or more of our significant international MBUs could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results.\n\nThe International segment is a significant profit center driving our global returns, along with our North America segment. In particular, our China MBU contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and International net revenues and operating income. China is currently our fastest growing market, our second largest market overall and 100% company-owned. Due to the significance of our China market for our profit and growth, we are exposed to risks in China, including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the following:\n\n- the effects of current U.S.-China relations, including rounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing restrictive regulations, potential boycotts and increasing anti-Americanism;\n- escalating U.S.-China tension and increasing political sensitivities in China;\n- the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental regulations and restrictions on our operations in China, including China's 'zero COVID' policy;\n- entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in China;\n- changes in economic conditions in China and potential negative effects to the growth of its middle class, wages, labor, inflation, discretionary spending and real estate and supply chain costs;\n- ongoing government regulatory reform, including relating to public health, food safety, tariffs and tax, sustainability and responses to climate change, which result in regulatory uncertainty as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs; and\n- food-safety related matters, including compliance with food-safety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety.\n\nAdditionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our U.S. stores and licensees. Tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in some MBUs may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the U.S. or other international markets. Occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the U.S. due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. Because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations.\n\n## \u00b7 We face risks as a global business that could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nWe operate in 83 markets globally. Our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as:\n\n- foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or requirements to transact in specific currencies;\n- changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets, as well as negative effects on U.S. businesses due to increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets;\n- interpretation and application of laws and regulations, including tax, tariffs, labor, merchandise, anti-bribery and privacy laws and regulations;\n- restrictive actions of foreign or U.S. governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension between the U.S. and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government intervention favoring local competitors and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership;\n- import or other business licensing requirements;\n- the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;\n- limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new U.S. and international regulations;",

Nike also values its inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value, using either average cost or specific identification methods, and includes detailed cost components such as supplier product cost, freight, import duties, and logistics fees to ensure accurate valuation. General Motors, while not directly valuing inventory, manages risk through a structured credit monitoring system for commercial finance receivables, particularly for dealers with III and IV risk ratings who are subject to funding restrictions and asset liquidation, indicating an indirect but strategic control over inventory-related credit exposure.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\n\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.\n\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\n\nLevel 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\n\nLevel 2 - Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\n\nLevel 3 - Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\n\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\n\nWe hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, these warrants had a fair value of $3.0 billion and $3.4 billion, and are recorded within 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a writedown of inventory, was $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "## CASH AND EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, with maturities three months or less at the date of purchase.\n\n## SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS\n\nShort-term investments consist of highly liquid investments with maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase. At May 31, 2022 and 2021, Short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale debt securities, which are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), unless unrealized losses are determined to be unrecoverable. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale debt securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and, therefore, classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond three months at the date of purchase as current assets within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nRefer to Note 6 - Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Company's Short-term investments.\n\n## ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\n\nAccounts receivable, net consist primarily of amounts due from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In addition to judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses, as well as macroeconomic and industry trends to determine the amount of the allowance. Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $34 million and $93 million as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n## INVENTORY VALUATION\n\nInventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value and valued on either an average or a specific identification cost basis. In some instances, the Company ships products directly from its suppliers to the customer, with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis. Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Company's suppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance, logistics and other handling fees.\n\n## PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for land improvements, buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years.\n\nDepreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales. Depreciation and amortization of all other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense.\n\n## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS\n\nExpenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over 2 to 12 years on a straight-line basis. The Company's policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. The Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.\n\nDevelopment costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established; therefore, software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally, most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 64",

Future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than ex pected asset returns, assuming other factors are held constant. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions.\n\nThere are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments. Examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy, insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and long-term investments.\n\nFactors that affect future funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for non-U.S. plans. Certain plans outside the U.S. do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid. If local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our nonU.S. plans, we could be required to contribute more funds, which could negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition.\n\n## *  *  *  *  *  *  *\n\n## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 1C. Cybersecurity\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats. We have implemented cybersecurity policies, procedures, technologies and controls to aid in our efforts to access, identify and manage such risks. Material risks from cybersecurity threats are managed across GM, GM Financial, Cruise, service providers such as data processors, third-party suppliers, dealers and vendors, and monitoring such risks and threats are integrated into the Company's overall risk management program.\n\nGM has a Cybersecurity Management Board that brings together representatives from senior management across the Company's Software &amp; Services, Product Development, Information Technology, Manufacturing, Finance, Communications, Human Resources, Legal and Public Policy organizations to provide guidance and monitor overall company cybersecurity risk. The Company's cybersecurity maturity scorecard, cybersecurity threats and incident information are reviewed by the Company's Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), the Risk and Cybersecurity Committee of the Company's Board of Directors and the Cybersecurity Management Board during standing meetings as well as in impromptu sessions, when appropriate. During the reviews, various topics are discussed, which may include:\n\n- implementation and maturity of the Company's cybersecurity program, risk management framework, including cybersecurity risk policies, procedures and governance;\n- cybersecurity and privacy risk, including potential impact to the Company's employees, customers, supply chain, joint ventures and other stakeholders;\n- intelligence briefings on notable cyber events impacting the industry; and\n- cybersecurity budget and resource allocation, including industry benchmarking and economic modeling of various potential cybersecurity events.\n\nThe Company maintains administrative, physical, technical and organizational safeguards, including employee training, incident response capability reviews and exercises, cybersecurity insurance and business continuity mechanisms for the protection of the Company's assets. From time to time, the Company's processes are audited and validated by internal and external experts. The Company leverages a third-party cybersecurity program with the goal of minimizing disruption to the Company's  business  and  production  operations,  strengthening  supply  chain  resilience  in  response  to  cyber-related  events  and  supporting  the  integrity  of components and systems used in its products and services.\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *",

We recognize the expected ultimate cost for claims incurred (undiscounted) at the balance sheet date as a liability. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred is estimated based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. We also maintain cybersecurity and priv acy liability insurance cov erage to help limit our exposure to losses such as those that may be caused by a significant compromise or breach of our data security, as well as property loss cov erage. Our self-insurance liabilities, which are included in accrued salaries and related expenses, other accrued expenses, and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, were $1.5 billion at February 2, 2025, and $1.4 billion at January 28, 2024.\n\n## Treasury Stock\n\nTreasury stock is reflected as a reduction of stockholders' equity at cost. We use the weighted av erage purchase cost to determine the cost of treasury stock that is reissued, if any. Excise taxes incurred on share repurchases represent direct costs of the repurchase and are recorded as a part of the cost basis of the shares within treasury stock.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe recognize revenue, net of expected returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or when a serv ice is performed. Our liability for sales returns is estimated based on historical return lev els and our expectation of future returns. We also recognize a return asset, and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales, for our right to recov er the goods returned by the customer, measured at the former carrying amount of the goods, less any expected recov ery cost. At each financial reporting date, we assess our estimates of expected returns, refund liabilities, and return assets.\n\nServices rev enue is generated through a v ariety of installation, home maintenance, and professional serv ice programs. In these programs, the customer selects and purchases material for a project, and we prov ide or arrange for professional installation. These programs are offered through our stores, online, and in-home sales programs. Under certain programs, when we prov ide or arrange for the installation of a project and the subcontractor prov ides material as part of the installation, both the material and labor are included in serv ices rev enue. We recognize serv ices rev enue when the serv ice for the customer is complete, which is not materially different from recognizing the rev enue ov er the serv ice period as the substantial majority of our serv ices are completed within one week.\n\nFor products and serv ices sold in stores or online, payment is typically due at the point of sale. When we receiv e payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the serv ice has been performed, the amount receiv ed is recorded as deferred rev enue until the sale or serv ice is complete. Such performance obligations are part of contracts with expected original durations of typically three months or less. As of February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024, deferred rev enue for products and serv ices was $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, respectiv ely.\n\nWe further record deferred rev enue for the sale of gift cards and recognize the associated rev enue upon the redemption of those gift cards, which generally occurs within six months of gift card issuance. As of both February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024, our performance obligations for unredeemed gift cards were $1.1 billion. Gift card breakage income, which is our estimate of the portion of our outstanding gift card balance not expected to be redeemed, is recognized in net sales and was immaterial in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022.\n\nCertain customers are prov ided with the ability to purchase products on credit with pre-approv ed limits where payment is due after deliv ery to the customer. We also have agreements with third-party serv ice prov iders who directly extend credit to customers, manage our PLCC program, and own the related receiv ables. We hav e ev aluated the third-party entities holding the receiv ables under the program and concluded that they should not be consolidated. The agreement with the primary third-party serv ice prov ider for our PLCC program expires in 2028, with us hav ing the option, but no obligation, to purchase the existing receiv ables at the end of the agreement. Deferred interest charges incurred for our deferred financing programs offered to these customers, interchange fees charged to us for their use of the cards, and any profit sharing with the third-party serv ice prov iders are included in net sales.",

Performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems, including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service, ransomware, or other cyber-attacks, or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented, could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers' perceptions of Lowe's as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services.\n\nOur business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected by cybersecurity incidents and the failure to protect customer, associate, vendor, or Company information or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems, assets, and such information. Cyber-attacks and tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving, and high profile security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred in recent years with increasing frequency at a number of major U.S. companies, including several large retailers, despite widespread recognition of the cyber-attack threat and improved data protection methods.\n\nAs with many other retailers, we collect, process, transmit, store, and delete certain personal information about our customers, associates, and vendors, as well as confidential, sensitive, proprietary and business, personal and payment card information. Additionally, we use third-party service providers for certain services, such as authentication, content delivery, back-office support, fraud prevention, order and service fulfillment, supply chain management, customer service, workforce management, and other functions, and we provide such third-party service providers with personal and other confidential information necessary for the services concerned.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we and our third-party service providers have in the past and will likely continue to experience cybersecurity threats and incidents, and certain of our third-party service providers have been subject to disruption due to ransomware and other cyber-attacks. Although, we do not believe such cybersecurity threats or incidents have had a material impact on us to date, there is no guarantee that a future cybersecurity threat or incident will be detected and remediated to not have a material adverse impact on our business strategy, reputation, results of operations, or financial condition. It can be difficult to preempt or detect ever-evolving forms of cyber-attacks, and we and our third-party service providers may not be able to adequately anticipate or prevent a future breach in our or their systems that results in the unauthorized access to, destruction, misuse, or release of personal information or other sensitive data. The increased levels of remote access to our information systems and the continued use of remote work infrastructure has further increased the possible attack surfaces, and we are exposed to increased risk to the security of our information systems or the information systems of third-party vendors and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data.\n\nA ransomware attack could prevent us or our third-party service providers from accessing data or systems that support Lowe's operations. Our information security or our service providers' information security may also be compromised because of human errors or acts, including by associates, or system errors. Our systems and our service providers' systems are additionally vulnerable to a number of other causes, such as critical infrastructure outages, computer viruses, technology system failures, catastrophic events or cyber-attacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, and ransomware. In the event that our systems are breached or damaged for any reason, we may also suffer loss or unavailability of data and interruptions to our business operations while such breach or damage is being remedied. Should these events occur, the unauthorized disclosure, loss, or unavailability of data and disruption to our business may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, drive ex isting and potential customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, or potential liability, including possible litigation and punitive damages. A security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of data from our information systems or our third-party service providers' information systems would also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks and require dedication of substantial resources to manage the aftermath of such a breach. We maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage although such insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur or may not cover certain cyber incidents. Additionally, the rapid evolution of AI and machine learning technologies and the implementation of pilot programs integrating generative AI into our internal and customer-facing systems may intensify our cybersecurity risks and create new risks to our business, operations, and financial condition.\n\nData privacy and cybersecurity laws are constantly changing, and the implementation of these laws has become more complex. In order to maintain our compliance with such laws as they come to fruition, we may sustain increased costs and change our business policies and processes in order to adapt to new requirements that are or become applicable to us. As the regulatory environment relating to retailers' and other companies' obligation to protect personal information becomes stricter, a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines, other regulatory sanctions, or government investigation, and potentially to lawsuits brought by private individuals, regulators or states' attorney general. Such violation or perceived violation of privacy, including improper collection, use of sharing of personal information, or failure to sufficiently disclose privacy practice, can adversely affect the trust that customers, associates, and business partners have in us related to their personal information.",

Under the terms of the Plans, incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options must have an exercise price at or above the fair market value of our stock on the date of the grant. Typically, nonqualified stock options vest at the rate of 25% per year commencing on the second anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary date of the grant. Additionally, a majority of our stock options may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service. No incentive stock options have been issued under the 2005 Plan.\n\nWe estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Our determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables.\n\nThe following table presents the per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted and the assumptions used in determining fair value at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model:\n\n",

In general, these awards vest 50% at the end of a two-year period from the date of grant and 50% at the end of a three-year period from the date of grant. Certain awards vest 100% at the end of a three-year period from the date of grant.

      "question": "How do The Home Depot, Lowe's, and McDonald's each characterize their competitive exposure to online retailers, and what does this reveal about the varying strategic importance of digital channels across their respective industries?",
      "answer": "The Home Depot emphasizes its investment in omnichannel capabilities, including enhanced merchandising information technology tools to build an interconnected shopping experience tailored to customer intent and location. Lowe's highlights its focus on omnichannel capabilities as a key competitive factor, leveraging its existing infrastructure to provide seamless transitions between online and in-store experiences. McDonald's, while not directly competing as an online retailer, notes that it faces competition from online retailers in the broader IEO (Impulse Eating-Out) segment and is investing in digital engagement, mobile ordering, and delivery to enhance the customer experience. The synthesis reveals that while all three companies recognize the strategic importance of digital channels, The Home Depot and Lowe's treat omnichannel integration as a core competitive differentiator in the home improvement retail space, whereas McDonald's views digital as an enabler to complement its physical service model in a different competitive landscape.",

      "question": "How do GM, MCD, and SBUX differ in their use and financial impact of foreign currency derivatives, and what does this reveal about their exposure to currency fluctuations in international markets?",
      "answer": "GM utilizes foreign currency derivatives primarily to manage risk in its Automotive and GM Financial segments, recording foreign currency transaction and remeasurement gains/losses directly in operating expenses or interest income, with a $203 million loss recorded in 2021. MCD reports foreign currency derivative impacts through nonoperating income/expense, with a $40.2 million gain in 2021 and a $12.3 million loss in 2020, indicating fluctuating exposure. SBUX holds foreign currency derivatives as current and long-term assets, totaling $34.3 million and $39.9 million in 2022, showing a more asset-based approach to managing currency exposure. These differences suggest GM focuses on operational hedging, MCD experiences direct P&L volatility, and SBUX maintains a balance sheet-oriented hedging strategy.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nForeign Currency Transactions and Translation The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that use the local currency as their functional currency are translated to U.S. Dollars based on the current exchange rate prevailing at each balance sheet date and any resulting translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  whose  local  currency  is  not  their  functional  currency  are  remeasured  from  their  local  currency  to  their  functional currency and then translated to U.S. Dollars. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars using the average exchange rates prevailing for each period presented. The financial statements of any foreign subsidiary that has been identified as having a highly inflationary economy are remeasured as if the functional currency were the U.S. Dollar.\n\nGains  and  losses  arising  from  foreign  currency  transactions  and  the  effects  of  remeasurements  discussed  in  the  preceding paragraph are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales and GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses unless related to Automotive debt, which are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Foreign currency transaction and remeasurement gains were $17 million, losses of $203 million and gains of $85 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. The accounting  for  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  each  derivative  financial  instrument  depends  on  whether  it  has  been  designated  and qualifies  as  an  accounting  hedge,  as  well  as  the  type  of  hedging  relationship  identified.  Derivative  instruments  are  not  used  for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nAutomotive We utilize options, swaps and forward contracts to manage foreign currency and commodity price risk. The change in fair value of option and forward contracts not designated as hedges is recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Cash flows for all derivative financial instruments are classified in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nWe estimate the fair value of the Stellantis warrants using a Black-Scholes formula. The significant inputs to the model include the Stellantis stock price and the estimated dividend yield. We are entitled to receive any dividends declared by Stellantis through the conversion date upon exercise of the warrants. Gains or losses as a result of the change in the fair value of the Stellantis warrants are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net.\n\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial GM Financial utilizes interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk. The change in fair value of the derivative instruments not designated as hedges is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. Cash flows for all derivative financial instruments are classified in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nCertain interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as fair value hedges. The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate or the risk of changes in fair value attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the swap has been designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. The change in fair value of the related hedge is also recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nCertain interest rate swap and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges. The risk being hedged is  the  interest  rate  and foreign currency risk related to forecasted transactions. If the contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the cash flow hedge is deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is recognized in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses along with the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded currently in earnings and are presented in the same income statement line as the earnings effect of the hedged item.",

      "answer": "AMZN explicitly states that it has registered or applied for the registration of a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights, indicating a proactive approach to securing digital assets. BKNG emphasizes its reliance on intellectual property such as trademarks, copyrights, and patents to support its business, particularly in the context of digital platforms and services that connect users with travel providers. TSLA highlights its focus on protecting innovations and designs through mechanisms like patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, with an emphasis on enabling freedom to operate across its product portfolio. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies value copyrights as part of their IP strategy, they apply them differently\u2014AMZN focuses on securing a broad portfolio, BKNG on enabling platform-based services, and TSLA on supporting innovation in product development.",

      "answer": "The Home Depot defines the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) in its glossary of terms but does not provide operational or financial details about its implementation or impact. Starbucks discloses that its ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10% of their base earnings toward the quarterly purchase of common stock, with the purchase price set at 95% of the fair market value, and notes that 0.6 million shares were issued under the ESPP in fiscal 2024. Tesla incorporates its ESPP into its broader stock-based compensation framework, stating that ESPP awards have a six-month vesting period and are accounted for under the fair value method, with compensation expense recognized over the vesting term. Comparing these approaches, Starbucks emphasizes employee participation and quantifies ESPP activity, Tesla integrates ESPP into its financial reporting with a focus on valuation and expense recognition, and The Home Depot treats ESPP primarily as a definitional term without disclosing any operational metrics, suggesting varying levels of emphasis and transparency around ESPPs in their employee compensation strategies.",

      "question": "How do BKNG, MCD, and TSLA each approach their dividend policies, and what does this reveal about their differing capital allocation strategies in 2023?",
      "answer": "BKNG introduced a formal dividend policy in early 2024, declaring a quarterly cash dividend of $8.75 per share, signaling a shift toward returning capital to shareholders. MCD, with a 48-year consecutive dividend history, continues to emphasize dividends as part of its capital return strategy, reviewing profitability and financing needs annually. TSLA, in contrast, has never paid a dividend and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future, preferring to reinvest cash flows into growth initiatives. This contrast reveals that BKNG is newly adopting shareholder-friendly policies, MCD maintains a long-standing commitment to consistent returns, and TSLA prioritizes growth reinvestment over immediate shareholder payouts.",

        "Hop 1: BKNG \u2192 Dividend Policy: Introduced a formal dividend policy in January 2024, declaring a $8.75 per share quarterly dividend, indicating a strategic pivot toward capital return.",

      "answer": "Booking Holdings uses U.S. Bank National Association as a trustee and transfer agent for multiple senior note issuances, including 0.100% notes due 2025, 4.000% notes due 2026, and 4.125% notes due 2033. Lowe\u2019s has a long-standing trust indenture relationship with U.S. Bank National Association, dating back to 1995, and has issued multiple note series through supplemental indentures, including 3.100% notes due 2027 and 4.550% notes due 2049. Tesla, through its acquisition of SolarCity, engaged U.S. Bank National Association as trustee for various solar bonds and convertible notes, including 2.00% convertible senior notes due 2024. The comparative analysis reveals that Booking Holdings leverages U.S. Bank for structured, multi-tenor debt offerings, Lowe\u2019s maintains a legacy and long-duration bond program, and Tesla utilizes the relationship primarily through acquired entities for project-specific financing.",

      "question": "How do Booking Holdings, Starbucks, and Tesla each structure their debt instruments with U.S. Bank National Association, and what does this reveal about their respective financing strategies in 2023?",
      "answer": "Booking Holdings issued multiple senior notes with U.S. Bank National Association as trustee, including 3.625% notes due in 2028 and 4.125% notes due in 2033, indicating a strategy of long-term fixed-rate financing. Starbucks entered into multiple supplemental indentures with U.S. Bank National Association for various senior notes, including 4.750% notes due in 2026 and 4.800% notes due in 2033, suggesting a mix of medium- and long-term financing. Tesla, through its subsidiary SolarCity, had historical indentures with U.S. Bank National Association for convertible and solar bonds, but no new issuances were disclosed in 2023, implying a shift away from this trustee for recent debt financing. Collectively, this shows differing capital structure approaches, with Booking and Starbucks actively tapping debt markets through U.S. Bank while Tesla appears to have moved toward alternative financing arrangements.",

      "answer": "HD describes warehouse clubs as part of a broader set of competitors, including home improvement retailers and online sellers, and emphasizes its focus on customer experience, product assortment, and delivery capabilities as key differentiators. LOW similarly lists warehouse clubs among its competitors and underscores omnichannel capabilities, store location, and product pricing as critical to maintaining competitive advantage. SBUX, while not directly competing with warehouse clubs in the coffee beverage segment, notes that warehouse clubs are key competitors in the distribution of packaged coffee and tea products sold through its Channel Development segment. This reveals that HD and LOW view warehouse clubs as direct retail competitors in the home improvement space, while SBUX competes more indirectly through product distribution channels, highlighting distinct competitive dynamics across the consumer discretionary sector.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of C ontents\n\nWe also maintain patent portfolios relating to our business operations, retail serv ices, and products, and we seek to patent or otherwise protect innov ations we incorporate into our business. Patents generally hav e a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built ov er time, the remaining terms of indiv idual patents across our patent portfolio v ary. Although our patents hav e v alue, no single patent is essential to our business. We continuously assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand the assortment of products offered within The Home Depot's portfolio of proprietary and exclusiv e brands.\n\n## COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY\n\nOur industry is highly competitiv e, highly fragmented, and ev olv ing. As a result, we face competition for customers for our products and serv ices from a variety of retailers, suppliers, serv ice prov iders, and distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respectiv e customer bases. These competitors range from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusiv ely online, and they include a number of other home improv ement retailers; local, regional and national hardware stores; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. With respect to some products and serv ices, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, paint stores, specialty and mass digital retailers, warehouse clubs, MRO distributors, national and local wholesale supply distributors, home d\u00e9cor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with prov iders of home improv ement serv ices and tool and equipment rental. The internet facilitates competitiv e entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the lev el of competition we face.\n\nBoth in-store and online, we compete primarily based on customer experience; price; quality; product av ailability, assortment, and innov ation; and deliv ery options and capabilities. We also compete based on store and branch location and appearance, presentation of merchandise, and ease of shopping experience throughout ev ery step of the project, from inspiration and research to any post-purchase support. Our Pros also look for dedicated sales support, competitiv e credit and pricing options, project planning tools, and product depth and job-lot quantities, particularly for their complex purchase needs. Furthermore, with respect to deliv ery options, customers are seeking faster and/or guaranteed deliv ery times, low-price or free shipping, and/or conv enient pickup options. Our ability to be competitiv e on deliv ery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including the success of our supply chain inv estments, described more fully under 'Our Supply Chain' below, and our interconnected retail strategy.\n\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our highest v olume of sales occurs in our second fiscal quarter, as we mov e into the spring season in the regions in which we operate.\n\n## INTERCONNECTED SHOPPING EXPERIENCE\n\nWe continue to enhance our capabilities to prov ide our customers with a frictionless interconnected shopping experience across our stores, branches, online, on the job site, and in their homes, focusing on continued inv estments in our websites and mobile apps to enhance the customer experience.\n\n## Digital Experience\n\nEnhancements to our digital platforms are critical for our increasingly interconnected customers, who often research products and check av ailable inv entory online before going into one of our stores to v iew products in person or talk to an associate and then making their purchase either in store or online. While in the store, customers may also go online to access ratings and rev iews, compare prices, v iew our extended assortment, and purchase additional products. Our inv estments in a truly interconnected experience are focused on bringing together the power of our physical presence and the frictionless interaction of our digital capabilities.\n\nA significant majority of the traffic in Home Depot's digital channels is on mobile dev ices. Mobile users expect more simplicity and relev ancy in their digital interactions. In addition to supporting our DIY and DIFM customers on their shopping journeys, mobile dev ices can also help serv e the needs of Pros working on complex projects.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThere are many variables that affect consumer demand for the home improvement products and services we offer.  Key indicators we monitor include home price appreciation, age of the housing stock, real disposable personal income, and housing turnover.  We also monitor demographic and societal trends that shape home improvement industry growth over time as the US population moves through major life stages and events. These include strong millennial household formation, an increased preference among older generations to age in place, and the persistence of remote work.\n\n## Our Competition\n\nThe home improvement industry includes a broad competitive landscape that continues to evolve.  We compete with national and regional home improvement warehouse chains and lumber yards in most of the markets we serve.  We also compete with traditional hardware, plumbing, electrical, and home supply retailers, as well as paint stores, lumber yards, garden centers, and maintenance and repair organizations.  In addition, we compete with general merchandise retailers, home goods specialty stores, warehouse clubs, online retailers, other specialty retailers, providers of equipment and tool rental, service providers that install home improvement products, and wholesalers that provide home-related products and services to homeowners, renters, businesses, and the government.\n\nLocation of stores, product assortment, product pricing, and customer service continue to be key competitive factors in our industry, while the evolution of technology, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies, ex pansion of fulfillment capabilities, and customer ex pectations also underscore the importance of omnichannel capabilities as a competitive factor.  See further discussion of competition in Item 1A, 'Risk Factors', of this Annual Report.\n\n## Our Omnichannel Capabilities\n\nWe are committed to meeting customer demand to shop however, whenever, and wherever they choose. Our omnichannel network provides a single view of the customer, no matter where they place their order, whether in-store, online, on-site or through the contact center. This allows our customers to move from channel to channel with simple and seamless transitions even within the same transaction. For example, for many projects, the majority of our customers conduct research online before making an in-store purchase. For purchases made on Lowes.com, customers may pick up their purchase in-store at the customer service desk, curbside, or from touchless lockers, or have their purchase delivered to their home or business. In addition, flex ible fulfillment options are available for in-store purchases and those made through the contact center. Regardless of the channels through which customers choose to engage with us, we strive to provide them with a seamless experience across channels and an extended aisle of products, enabled by our flexible fulfillment capabilities. Our ability to sell products in-store, online, on-site, or through our contact centers speaks to our leverage of our existing infrastructure with the omnichannel capabilities we continue to introduce.\n\n## In-Store\n\nOur 1,748 Lowe's-branded home improvement stores and outlet stores are generally open seven days per week and average approximately 112,000 square feet of retail selling space, plus approximately 32,000 square feet of outdoor garden center selling space.  Our home improvement stores offer similar products and services, with certain variations based on localization, along with a dedicated team of knowledgeable and friendly frontline associates available to assist our customers.  We continue to develop and implement productivity tools, including our front-end transformation and freight flow optimization initiatives, to enhance the efficiency of our sales associates and improve the customer experience.  Our Lowe's Outlet stores have a smaller format and offer value to our customers through incremental savings on discontinued, overstocked, or scratch and dent items.\n\n## Online\n\nThrough our websites and mobile applications, we seek to empower consumers by providing a 24/7 shopping experience, product information, customer ratings and reviews, buying guides, how-to videos, and other information. These tools help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions and give them increased confidence to undertake home improvement projects. We enable customers to choose from a variety of fulfillment options, including buying online and picking up instore, curbside pick-up, same-day delivery through our gig network, and shipment to their homes or businesses. Further, we also offer digital inspiration, design, and project management tools across our destination home improvement categories.\n\n## On-Site\n\nWe have on-site specialists available for retail and Pro customers to assist them in selecting products and services for their projects.  Our Pro sales managers meet with Pro customers at their place of business or on a job site and leverage nearby stores and our distribution network to ensure we meet customer needs for products and resources.  In addition, our In-Home Sales program is available in the majority of our stores to discuss various exterior projects such as windows, doors, and fencing, whose characteristics lend themselves to an in-home consultative sales approach.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nTo help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates ten farmer support centers, including our China Farmer Support Center located in the Yunnan Province of this high-growth market. Farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields as well as agronomy support to address climate change and other impacts.\n\nIn addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical performance of our dairy and plant-based dairy-free suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk and plant-based dairy-free alternatives to support our stores generally is remote.\n\nProducts other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches, and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional, and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We are also expanding our use of reusable packaging to reduce landfill waste. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical performance of our suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items generally is remote.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee retailers and shops. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers and shops primarily on the basis of product quality, brand reputation, service, and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to both well-established and start-up companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.\n\nOur coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores, and foodservice accounts and also compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market.\n\n## Trademarks, Copyrights, Patents, and Domain Names\n\nStarbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve, and Frappuccino, are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.\n\nWe own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics, and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems, and designs, which have an average remaining duration of approximately thirteen years. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including 'Starbucks.com,' 'Starbucks.net,' and 'Starbucksreserve.com.'\n\n## Seasonality and Quarterly Results\n\nOur business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our second fiscal quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. Additionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to, and loaded by, customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the Starbucks Cards, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the United States and the multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the rules, reporting obligations, and interpretations of all such requirements and obligations by various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. In addition, changes to such laws, regulations, rules, reporting obligations, and related compliance obligations could result in significant costs but are not expected to have a material effect on our capital ex penditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods.",

      "answer": "Home Depot is migrating accounting and finance systems as part of a business transformation initiative that began in fiscal 2020, with ongoing modifications to internal control processes during the multi-year implementation. McDonald's is implementing a comprehensive finance and technology transformation to modernize its general ledger, financial close, and consolidation processes through new financial systems, not in response to any deficiencies but to increase efficiency. Tesla implemented enhancements to its disclosure controls as part of a 2018 SEC settlement following Elon Musk's public statements about taking the company private, which included appointing independent directors and strengthening corporate governance procedures.

A major breach of our network security and systems may result in fines, penalties and damages and harm our brand, prospects and operating results.\n\n## We could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain governmental investigations and proceedings.\n\nWe are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.\n\nFor example, on October 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the Court on September 29, 2018, in connection with the actions taken by the SEC relating to Mr. Musk's statement on August 7, 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private. Pursuant to the settlement, we, among other things, paid a civil penalty of $20 million, appointed an independent director as the chair of our board of directors, appointed two additional independent directors to our board of directors and made further enhancements to our disclosure controls and other corporate governance-related matters. On April 26, 2019, this settlement was amended to clarify certain of the previously-agreed disclosure procedures, which was subsequently approved by the Court. All other terms of the prior settlement were reaffirmed without modification. Although we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement, if there is a lack of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance, additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings may be instituted against us.\n\n## We may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly.\n\nWhile we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, including sales through our website, we may not be able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales model. It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators, and such assertions persist. In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. The application of state laws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict.\n\nInternationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\n## The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.\n\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intra-day trading high of $1,243.49 per share and a low of $539.49 per share. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion of our common stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Public perception and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our shares, securities class action litigation has been filed against us. While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources.",

      "question": "How did Lowe's (LOW), McDonald's (MCD), and Starbucks (SBUX) each approach pricing strategies in 2022 to respond to shifting consumer behavior and economic conditions, and what specific impacts did these strategies have on their respective sales performance and market positioning?",
      "answer": "Lowe's leveraged disciplined pricing strategies in 2022, contributing to a 65 basis point improvement in gross margin, particularly in high-demand categories like Electrical and Lumber driven by Pro customer demand and inflationary pricing. McDonald's emphasized that its financial success depended on its ability to execute effective pricing, promotional, and marketing plans to respond to evolving customer behavior and economic conditions, noting that misalignment could negatively impact sales and market share. Starbucks acknowledged that its success depended on adjusting pricing and promotional strategies to respond to shifting economic and competitive conditions, with an emphasis on maintaining brand relevance and customer engagement. Synthesizing these perspectives reveals that while all three companies recognized pricing as a strategic lever, Lowe's focused on cost and pricing discipline to improve margins, McDonald's on balancing value and profitability amid intense competition, and Starbucks on aligning pricing with brand positioning and evolving consumer expectations.",

We delivered strong comparable sales in Electrical and Lumber due to strong unit demand from Pro customers, as well as unit price increases driven by inflation. New product offerings drove strong sales in Flooring, led by Vinyl Flooring. We experienced lower comparable sales in Paint, Hardware, and Lighting due to cycling prior year DIY demand at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Geographically, all fifteen U.S. regions and Canada experienced positive comparable sales.\n\nGross Margin - Gross margin as a percentage of sales for 2021 increased 29 basis points compared to 2020. Gross margin was positively impacted by approximately 65 basis points of total rate improvement driven by continued improvement in managing product costs and disciplined pricing strategies, as well as approximately 25 basis points of leverage from higher credit revenue. These benefits were partially offset by 35 basis points of deleverage due to product mix and 30 basis points of deleverage from supply chain costs.\n\nSG&amp;A - SG&amp;A expense for 2021 leveraged 167 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2020. This was primarily driven by 115 basis points of leverage due to lower COVID-19 related expenses, including additional compensation to hourly front-line associates, emergency paid leave, and cleaning costs; 45 basis points of leverage in retail operating salaries due to increased sales and improved operating efficiencies as a result of our PPI initiatives; and 30 basis points of leverage due to costs associated with the reset of the layout of our U.S. stores in the prior year. These benefits were partially offset by 20 basis points of deleverage due to the fourth quarter discretionary bonus to front-line associates.\n\nDepreciation and Amortization - Depreciation and amortization expense deleveraged 17 basis points for 2021 as a percentage of sales compared to 2020, driven by ongoing capital investments in store environment, store equipment, and technology projects. Property, less accumulated depreciation, decreased to $19.1 billion at January 28, 2022, compared to $19.2 billion at January 29, 2021.\n\nInterest - Net - Net interest expense is comprised of the following:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## If we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and marketing plans, our business could suffer.\n\nOur continued success depends on our System's ability to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages. In order to do so, we need to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings, and consumer behavior and preferences, including with respect to environmental and social responsibility matters, in the IEO segment. If we are not able to predict, or quickly and effectively respond to, these changes, or if our competitors predict or respond more effectively, our financial results could be adversely impacted.\n\nOur ability to build upon our strengths and advantages also depends on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across the System, and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer behavior and preferences, as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions. Existing or future pricing strategies and marketing plans, as well as the value proposition they represent, are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy. However, they may not be successful, or may not be as successful as the efforts of our competitors, which could negatively impact sales, guest counts and market share.\n\nAdditionally, we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching our customers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels, including digital marketing, allows us to reach our customers effectively, efficiently and in ways that are meaningful to them. If our advertising and marketing programs are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease.\n\n## Our investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected results.\n\nOur long-term business objectives depend on the successful Systemwide execution of our strategies. We continue to build upon our investments in technology and modernization, digital engagement and delivery in order to transform the customer experience. As part of these investments, we are continuing to place emphasis on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, mobile ordering and payment systems, and enhancing our drive thru technologies, which may not generate expected results. We also continue to offer and refine our delivery initiatives, including through growing awareness and trial. Utilizing a third-party delivery service may not have the same level of profitability as a non-delivery transaction, and may introduce additional food quality, food safety and customer satisfaction risks. If these customer experience initiatives are not well executed, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our business results may suffer.\n\n## We face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business.\n\nWe compete primarily in the IEO segment, which is highly competitive. We also face sustained, intense competition from traditional, fast casual and other competitors, which may include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores, grocery stores, coffee shops and online retailers. We expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive, and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by a contracting IEO segment or by new or continuing actions, product offerings or consolidation of our competitors and third-party partners, which may have a short- or long-term impact on our results.\n\nWe compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. In particular, we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, successfully develop and introduce new products, price our products appropriately, deliver a relevant customer experience, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations, manage our investments in technology and modernization, and respond effectively to our competitors' actions or offerings or to unforeseen disruptive actions. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics, which could have the overall effect of harming our business.\n\n## We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the McDonald's brand and our business.\n\nThe success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products.\n\nWe have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, and the steps we have taken to do so in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. In particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business.\n\nWe cannot ensure that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Risks Related to Brand Relevance and Brand Execution\n\n- Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\nWe believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social and environmental impact programs. The Starbucks brand is recognized throughout most of the world, and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. To be successful in the future, particularly outside of the U.S. where the Starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities.\n\nBusiness incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value, potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results. Such incidents include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws, contaminated food, product recalls, store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases, such as COVID-19, safety-related incidents or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section. The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation. Consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we, our employees, licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased, unequal or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of customers at Starbucks stores, treatment of employees or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes. Furthermore, if we are not effective in addressing our social and environmental program goals, executing on our Reinvention Plan, or achieving relevant sustainability goals, consumer trust in our brand may suffer, and this perception could result in negative publicity or litigation. Additionally, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations, take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well or to foster an inclusive and diverse environment, our brand value may be diminished.\n\nThe ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our social and environmental program goals as well as the success of the Reinvention Plan, which requires company-wide coordination and alignment. We are working to manage risks and costs to us, our licensees and our supply chain of any effects of climate change as well as diminishing energy and water resources. These risks include any increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, including packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. These risks may also include any increased pressure to make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks.\n\n- We may not be successful in our marketing, promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategies.\n\nOur continued success depends in part on our ability to adjust our marketing, promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategy to respond quickly and effectively to shifting economic and competitive conditions as well as evolving customer preferences. We operate in a complex and costly marketing, promotional and advertising environment. Our marketing, promotional and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching our customers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising, promotional and marketing resources across different channels, including digital marketing, allows us to reach our customers effectively and efficiently, and in ways that are meaningful to them. If the advertising, promotional and marketing programs or our pricing strategies are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales and market share could decrease.\n\nFinally, customers are focusing more on sustainability and the environmental impacts of operations. An inability to meet customer expectations with respect to these issues could adversely affect our financial results.\n\n## Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy\n\n- Failure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protections laws and regulations may subject us to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties.\n\nComplex local, state, national, foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. These privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations and enforcement. In addition, our legal and regulatory obligations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to unexpected changes, including the potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations or to increase penalties",

      "question": "How do AMZN, GM, and HD each engage with the vehicle market, and what do their respective financial disclosures reveal about the strategic importance of vehicles to their 2023 operations?",
      "answer": "AMZN discloses that it leases vehicles as part of its fulfillment and logistics infrastructure, with $68.0 billion in gross assets under finance leases, including vehicles, indicating a significant investment in transportation to support delivery operations. GM, as a vehicle manufacturer, engages in transactions with nonconsolidated affiliates to sell vehicles and parts, showing its reliance on a broad distribution and partnership network to move its products to market. HD also leases vehicles, as part of its broader leasing strategy that includes retail, warehouse, and equipment leases, though the specific value of vehicle leases is not disclosed, suggesting a less central role compared to AMZN\u2019s logistics and GM\u2019s core manufacturing. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies interact with vehicles, the strategic importance varies: AMZN relies on vehicles for delivery scale, GM for product distribution, and HD for operational support.",

      "answer": "Amazon values its inventories using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method and records a valuation allowance of $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, based on expected recoverable values through various disposition methods. Nike also uses the lower of cost and net realizable value method, applying either average cost or specific identification, and includes costs such as freight and import duties in inventory valuation. Tesla uses FIFO for vehicles and energy storage products and actual cost for solar systems, with inventory write-downs based on demand forecasts and net realizable value assessments, and it warns that changes in these estimates could materially affect its financial results. Collectively, these approaches show that while all three companies apply conservative inventory valuation practices, they differ in methodology and risk exposure, with Amazon and Tesla explicitly disclosing financial impacts from inventory write-downs, while Nike focuses on cost composition without quantifying its write-downs.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\n\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.\n\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\n\nLevel 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\n\nLevel 2 - Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\n\nLevel 3 - Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\n\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\n\nWe hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, these warrants had a fair value of $3.0 billion and $3.4 billion, and are recorded within 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a writedown of inventory, was $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "## CASH AND EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, with maturities three months or less at the date of purchase.\n\n## SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS\n\nShort-term investments consist of highly liquid investments with maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase. At May 31, 2022 and 2021, Short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale debt securities, which are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), unless unrealized losses are determined to be unrecoverable. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale debt securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and, therefore, classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond three months at the date of purchase as current assets within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nRefer to Note 6 - Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Company's Short-term investments.\n\n## ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\n\nAccounts receivable, net consist primarily of amounts due from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In addition to judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses, as well as macroeconomic and industry trends to determine the amount of the allowance. Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $34 million and $93 million as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n## INVENTORY VALUATION\n\nInventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value and valued on either an average or a specific identification cost basis. In some instances, the Company ships products directly from its suppliers to the customer, with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis. Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Company's suppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance, logistics and other handling fees.\n\n## PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for land improvements, buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years.\n\nDepreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales. Depreciation and amortization of all other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense.\n\n## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS\n\nExpenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over 2 to 12 years on a straight-line basis. The Company's policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. The Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.\n\nDevelopment costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established; therefore, software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally, most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 64",

          "chunk_text": "## MyPower Customer Notes Receivable\n\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $299 million and $334 million, respectively, of which $11 million and $9 million were due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the allowance for expected credit losses was $41 million and $45 million, respectively.\n\n## Concentration of Risk\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, accounts receivable, convertible note hedges, and interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the U.S. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, no entity represented 10% or more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our convertible note hedges and interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly-rated multinational banks.\n\n## Supply Risk\n\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n\n## Operating Lease Vehicles\n\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated depreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $5.28 billion and $3.54 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $773 million and $446 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Digital Assets, Net\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we purchased an aggregate of $1.50 billion in bitcoin (a \"digital asset\") and briefly accepted bitcoin as a payment for sales of certain of our products in specified regions, subject to applicable laws. We account for such non-cash consideration at the time we enter into transactions with our customers in accordance with the non-cash consideration guidance included in the Accounting Standards Codification ('ASC') 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , based on the then current quoted market prices of the digital assets.",

      "question": "How do Amazon's broad intellectual property registrations, Starbucks' brand-focused copyrights, and Tesla's open-source patent policy each reflect distinct strategic approaches to protecting revenue-generating assets in their respective markets?",
      "answer": "Amazon emphasizes comprehensive intellectual property registration, including trademarks, copyrights, and patents, to protect its vast array of products and services across multiple industries, which is critical for maintaining its competitive edge in e-commerce and cloud services. Starbucks focuses on brand-related copyrights, including packaging, promotional materials, and in-store graphics, to reinforce its brand identity and customer experience in the specialty coffee market. Tesla, by contrast, adopts an open-source patent policy to encourage industry-wide innovation in electric vehicles while retaining control over its core technologies and brand identity. These strategies reflect how each company aligns its intellectual property protection with its business model and market dynamics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMZN \u2192 Copyrights: Amazon has registered or applied for numerous U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights to protect its intellectual property, which is critical to its success across multiple business lines.",
        "Hop 2: SBUX \u2192 Copyrights: Starbucks owns copyrights for product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics, and training materials, highlighting its focus on brand identity and customer experience.",
        "Hop 3: TSLA \u2192 Copyrights: Tesla seeks to protect its innovations through a combination of patents, trademarks, and copyrights but has pledged not to sue for patent infringement in the electric vehicle space, promoting broader industry adoption."

NKE has entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $1.8 billion, under which it receives fixed interest and pays variable interest based on SOFR, with these swaps maturing in fiscal 2034, indicating a long-term strategic hedge against variable rate exposure.

We generally own or secure a long-term lease on the land and building for conventional franchised and Company-owned and operated restaurant sites. We seek to identify and develop restaurant locations that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential. A s we generally secure long-term real estate interests for our restaurants, we have limited flex ibility  to quickly  alter our real estate portfolio. The competitiv e business landscape continues to ev olv e in light of changing business trends, consumer preferences, trade area demographics, consumer use of digital, delivery and drive thru, local competitive positions and other economic factors. If our restaurants are not located in desirable locations, or if we do not evolve in response to these factors, it could adversely affect Systemwide sales and profitability.\n\nOur real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate operations are also impacted by a variety of other factors, including governmental regulations, insurance, zoning, tax and eminent domain laws, interest rate levels, the cost of financing, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities, or other factors beyond our control. A  significant change in real estate values, or an increase in costs as a result of any of these factors, could adversely affect our operating results.\n\n## Information technology system failures or interruptions, or breaches of network security, may impact our operations or cause reputational harm.\n\nWe are increasingly reliant upon technology systems, such as point-of-sale, that support our business operations, including our digital and delivery solutions, and technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration with affiliated entities, customers, employees, franchisees, suppliers, service providers or other independent third parties to conduct our business, whether developed and maintained by us or provided by third parties. A ny failure or interruption of these systems could significantly impact our or our franchisees' operations, or our customers' experiences and perceptions. In addition, the artificial intelligence tools we are incorporating into certain aspects of our business may not generate the intended efficiencies and may impact our business results.\n\nSecurity incidents and breaches have from time to time occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the systems of the parties with whom we communicate or collaborate (including franchisees) or the systems of third-party providers. These may include such things as unauthorized access, phishing attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, computer viruses, deepfakes and other malicious uses of artificial intelligence, introduction of malware or ransomware, other disruptive problems caused by hackers or unintentional events. Certain of these technology systems contain personal, confidential, financial and other information of our customers, employees, franchisees and their employees, suppliers and other third parties, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. Despite response procedures and measures in place in the event an incident occurs, it could result in disruptions, shutdowns, or a security breach including the theft or unauthorized disclosure of certain of the above-described information. The actual or alleged occurrence of any of these types of incidents could result in mitigation costs, reputational damage, adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk, including administrative fines, criminal or civil penalties or civil liabilities.\n\nDespite the implementation of business continuity measures, any of these technology systems could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Certain technology systems may also become vulnerable, unreliable or inefficient in cases where technology vendors limit or terminate product support and/or maintenance. Our increasing reliance on third-party systems also subjects us to risks faced by those third-party businesses, including operational, security and credit risks. Further, the technology systems of third parties upon which we rely to conduct our business could be compromised in a manner that adversely affects us and our technology systems, information and business continuity. If technology systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, or if business continuity or disaster recovery plans were not effective, and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we could experience an interruption in our or our franchisees' operations. While we maintain insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\n## LEGAL AND REG ULATORY\n\n## Increasing regulatory and legal complexity may adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\nOur regulatory and legal environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways. M any of our markets are subject to increasing, conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations involving, among other matters, restaurant operations, product packaging, marketing, use of information technology systems, the nutritional and allergen content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices. Compliance efforts with those regulations may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers. We also are subject to increasing public focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, on environmental, social responsibility and corporate governance matters. Our success depends in part on our",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nAs is the case for some automotive companies, some of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. Where multiple sources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize potential production risks due to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times.\n\nOur products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these materials is governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and demand and market speculation. We strive to execute long-term supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible, and we currently believe that we have adequate access to raw materials supplies to meet the needs of our operations.\n\n## Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations\n\nGlobally, the ownership of our products by our customers is impacted by various government credits, incentives, and policies. Our business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.\n\nThe operation of our business is also impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\n\n## Programs and Incentives\n\n## Inflation Reduction Act\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ('IRA') was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022, and remains subject to future guidance releases. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax credits to consumers. For example, under current legislation, qualifying Tesla customers may receive up to $7,500 in federal tax  credits for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles in the U.S. through 2032.\n\n## Automotive Regulatory Credits\n\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles ('ZEVs'), greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Energy Storage System Incentives and Policies\n\nWhile the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.\n\nFor example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal tax credits described below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ('FERC') has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self G eneration Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs. In certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration. In such transactions, they are included as a component of energy generation and storage revenues in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nPursuant to the IRA, under Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the Internal Revenue Code ('IRC'), standalone energy storage technology is eligible for a tax credit between 6% and 50% of qualified expenditures, regardless of the source of energy, which may be claimed by our customers for storage systems they purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These tax credits are primarily for the benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.",

SBUX emphasizes that evolving privacy laws, including the CCPA, may require changes to data processing practices and could result in fines, litigation, or regulatory orders, impacting business operations. Tesla notes that CCPA imposes legal obligations on its handling of personal information related to California residents and that compliance may require operational changes and system enhancements, with noncompliance risking penalties. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies face rising compliance costs and regulatory scrutiny under CCPA, their operational adaptations reflect their respective exposure to consumer data and regulatory complexity in the Consumer Discretionary sector.",

Similarly, such an occurrence could result in the compromise, acquisition or loss of the information processed by these systems and products. Such events could result in, among other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation. In addition, such events could increase the risk of claims alleging that we are non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subjecting us to potential liability from private  litigation  or  regulatory  penalties  and  related  costs  under  laws  protecting  the  privacy  of  personal  information  or  unfair  or  deceptive  practices  relating  to consumer information; disrupt our operations; or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies. V arious events described above have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Although impacts of past events have been immaterial, the impacts of such events in the future may be material.\n\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions of our in-vehicle systems could impact the safety of our customers and reduce confidence in GM and our products . Our vehicles  contain  complex  information  technology  systems.  These  systems  control  various  vehicle  functions  including  engine,  transmission,  safety,  steering, navigation,  acceleration,  braking,  window,  door  lock  functions  and  battery  and  electric  motors.  We  have  designed,  implemented  and  tested  security  measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to these systems. However, hackers and other malicious actors have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use networks, vehicle software or their systems to gain control of, or to change, our vehicles' functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle. Any unauthorized access to, or control of, our vehicles or their systems or any unauthorized access to, acquisition of or loss of data could adversely impact the safety of our customers or result in failure of our systems, any of which could result in interruptions to our business, legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties. Laws that would permit third-party access to vehicle data and related systems, including \"right to repair\" laws, could expose our vehicles and vehicle systems to third-party access without appropriate security measures in place, leading to new safety and security risks for our customers and reducing customer trust and confidence in our products. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles or their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our vehicles or their systems or data are capable of being \"hacked\" and lack appropriate safety controls, could negatively affect our brand and harm our reputation, which could adversely impact our business and operating results.\n\nOur enterprise data practices, including the collection, use,  sharing  and  security  of  the  personal  or  other  information  of  our  customers,  employees  and suppliers, are subject to increasingly complex and restrictive regulations in all key market regions . Data privacy and protection and unfair and deceptive practice laws and similar regulations in many jurisdictions where we do business require that we take significant steps to safeguard such personal information, and these laws and regulations continue to evolve. Under these regulations, which include, but are not limited to, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, the EU's G eneral Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, the U.K. Data Protection Act of 2018, and other international data protection, privacy, data security, data localization and similar national, state, provincial, and local laws, the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints, private litigation and regulatory inquiry resulting in civil or criminal penalties, as well as have a negative impact on our brand or result in other harm to our business.  In addition, increased consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failures in establishing, implementing and maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services.  The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be high and is likely to increase in the future. The growing patchwork of state and country regulations imposes burdensome obligations on companies to  quickly  respond  to  consumer  requests,  such  as  requests  to  delete,  disclose  and  stop  selling  personal  information,  with  significant  fines  for  noncompliance. Complying with these new laws has significantly increased, and may continue to increase, our operating costs and is driving increased complexity in our operations.\n\n## Risks related to government regulations and litigation\n\nOur operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business. We are significantly affected by governmental regulations on a global basis that can increase  costs  related  to  the  production  of  our  vehicles  and  affect  our  product  portfolio,  particularly  regulations  relating  to  fuel  economy  standards  and  G HG emissions. Meeting the requirements of these regulations is costly, often technologically challenging and may require phase-out of ICE vehicles in certain major jurisdictions, and these standards are often not harmonized across jurisdictions. We anticipate that the number and extent of these and other regulations, laws and policies, and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio, may increase significantly in the future, primarily motivated by efforts to reduce GHG  emissions. Specifically, fuel economy and GHG  emission regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to further limit the sale of certain profitable ICE products in current and future years, subsidize the sale of less profitable ones, change our manufacturing processes, pay increased penalties, purchase  additional  credits  from  our  competitors  or  undertake  other  activities  that  may  require  us  to  incur  additional  ex pense,  which  may  be  material.

Further, statements about our ESG-related initiatives and goals, and progress toward those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. Previously reported data may in the future be adjusted to reflect improvements in the availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations, and other changes in circumstances. If our ESG-related data, processes, and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, our reputation, business, financial performance, and growth could be adversely affected. If we are unable to meet our ESG-related goals, commitments, initiatives, or evolving stakeholder or industry expectations and standards, if we change or are perceived to have changed our goals, commitments, or initiatives, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to stakeholder interests in ESG issues, customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor, and our reputation, business, or financial condition may be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, we could be criticized by shareholders, stakeholders, regulators, or other interested parties for the scope or nature of our ESG initiatives or goals or for any revisions to these goals. We have been and could continue to be subject to negative responses by governmental actors (such as anti-ESG legislation or retaliatory legislative treatment) or consumers (such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns) targeting Starbucks, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial performance, and growth.\n\n## Certain activist shareholder actions have caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur expense, hinder execution of our business strategy, and adversely impact our stock price.\n\nWe actively engage in discussions with our shareholders regarding further strengthening our Company and creating long-term shareholder value. This ongoing dialogue can include certain divisive activist tactics, which can take many forms. Some shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, has resulted in, and could in the future result in, substantial costs, such as legal fees and ex penses, and the diversion of management's and our Board's attention and resources from our businesses and strategic plans. Additionally, public shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with our customers, partners, licensees, or business partners, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. Activists or other shareholders holding a large portion of our outstanding shares will also have the ability to ex ert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, including the election of directors, the approval of mergers, acquisitions, and other significant business transactions, shareholder proposals, and amendments to our governing documents. These risks could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\n## Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation\n\n## Failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results.\n\nOur policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules, and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the SEC, Nasdaq, and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, food and beverage, sanitation, safety, environmental, labeling, anti-bribery and corruption, and merchandise laws. Such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations, which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of non-compliance. For example, changes in the enforcement priorities of regulators may also shift the impact of applicable regulations on the business and the costs necessary to ensure compliance therewith, including through an expansion in the nature, scope, or complexity of matters on which we are required to report. Changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, including expanded or additional regulations and associated costs to limit carbon diox ide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital ex penditures, incremental investments, and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. Other ex amples of emerging and potentially relevant requirements are import tariffs and restrictions grounded in, among other things, alleged human rights abuses.\n\nIn addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux, and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area. Current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, discussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable international and U.S. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies, or result in the possibility of fines, litigation, or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and",

New, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could also lead to increased costs of compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant, and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines. In addition, as we have increased our operations, we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government investigations, that we will need to defend against. If we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it may harm our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, business and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad. For example, in countries outside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different from equivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in all countries. This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements.\n\nIn particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation. We are continuing to develop our Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) technology. There are a variety of international, federal and state regulations that may apply to, and may adversely affect, the design and performance, sale, marketing, registration and operation of Autopilot and FSD (Supervised), and future capability, including autonomous vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. Such regulations, including their enforcement or the enforcement policy associated with the regulations, continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which could adversely affect our business.\n\nFinally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a supplier of electricity generated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a provider of grid services through virtual power plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning the import or export of components, electricity pricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-owned systems. If regulations and policies are introduced that adversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance or use of our solar and energy storage systems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and services, threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant jurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Any failure by us to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us.\n\nAny failure by us or our vendors or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or international privacy, data protection, artificial intelligence or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an unsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us. In addition, certain privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation, application and impact, and may require ex tensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union requiring certain data protection measures when handling, with a significant risk of fines for noncompliance. Similarly, our North American operations are subject to complex and changing federal and US state-specific data privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act which imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to California residents. Finally, additional privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in China, and other jurisdictions where Tesla has a market presence.\n\nThese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs and make enhancements to relevant data practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.",

      "question": "How do Booking Holdings, Home Depot, and Starbucks each approach the determination of fair value assumptions in their financial reporting, and what does this reveal about their differing exposures to estimation uncertainty in key accounting metrics?",
      "answer": "Booking Holdings emphasizes that fair value estimates for private investments involve significant judgment and are subject to risks such as expected growth rates, the impact of the pandemic, and discount rates, with a carrying value of $306 million at the end of 2021. Home Depot uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock options, with $496 million in unamortized stock-based compensation as of early 2022, highlighting sensitivity to stock price and volatility assumptions. Starbucks determines the fair value of stock-based compensation using either the Black-Scholes-Merton model for options or the market price for RSUs, and also applies Monte Carlo simulations when total shareholder return performance conditions are involved. The synthesis reveals that while all three companies rely on fair value assumptions, Booking Holdings faces the most external uncertainty due to private investment valuations, whereas HD and SBUX face internal model-based uncertainties tied to compensation structures.",

It requires significant judgments and estimates and actual results could be materially different than those judgments and estimates utilized in the fair value estimate. Future events and changing market conditions may lead us to re-evaluate the assumptions reflected in our valuation, particularly the assumptions related to the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the shape and timing of the recovery and the overall impact on the investee's business, which may result in a need to recognize an additional impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe determine our tax expense based on our income and statutory tax rates applicable in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Due to the complex nature of tax legislation and frequent changes with such associated legislation, significant judgment is required in computing our tax expense and determining our tax positions. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") enacted in December 2017 made significant changes to U.S. federal tax law, including a one-time deemed repatriation tax imposed on accumulated unremitted international earnings, to be paid over eight years. We do not intend to indefinitely reinvest our international earnings that were subject to U.S. taxation pursuant to the mandatory deemed repatriation or subject to U.S. taxation as global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\").\n\nWe regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences, and tax planning strategies and record valuation allowances as required.\n\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. We have been audited in many jurisdictions and from time to time face challenges regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. Although we believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and comply with applicable law, we regularly review our tax filing positions, especially in light of tax law or business practice changes, and we may change our positions or determine that previous positions should be amended, either of which could result in additional tax liabilities. The final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\n\nThe evaluation of tax positions and recognition of income tax benefits require significant judgement and we consult with external tax and legal counsel as appropriate. We consider the technical merits of our tax positions along with the applicable tax statutes, related interpretations and precedents, and our expectation of the outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with tax authorities. We recognize liabilities when we believe that uncertain positions may not be fully sustained upon audit by the tax authorities, including any related appeals or litigation processes. Liabilities recognized for uncertain tax positions are based on a two-step approach for recognition and measurement. First, we evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits. Second, we measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties attributable to uncertain tax positions, if any, are recognized as a component of income tax expense. The tax benefits ultimately realized by us may be different than what is recorded in the financial statements due to future events such as our settling the matter with the tax authorities and our success in sustaining our tax positions.\n\nSee Notes 15 and 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nLoss contingencies (other than income tax-related contingencies disclosed above) arise from actual or possible claims and assessments and pending or threatened litigation that may be brought against us by individuals, governments, or other entities. Based on our assessment of loss contingencies at each balance sheet date, a loss is recorded in the financial statements if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we disclose information about the contingency in the financial statements. We also disclose information in our financial statements about reasonably possible loss contingencies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Government Subsidies\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ('CARES Act'), which among other things, provides employer payroll tax credits for wages paid to employees who are unable to work during the COVID19 pandemic and options to defer payroll tax payments for a limited period. Based on our evaluation of the CARES Act, we qualify for certain employer payroll tax credits as well as the deferral of payroll tax payments in the future. Additionally, the Canadian government enacted the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy ('CEWS') to help employers offset a portion of their employee wages for a limited period. We elected to treat qualified government subsidies from the U.S., Canada and other governments as offsets to the related operating expenses. The CARES Act and CEWS were no longer applicable to us in late fiscal 2021. The qualified payroll credits reduced our store operating expenses by $210.0 million and $349.6 million on our consolidated statement of earnings during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. After netting the qualified credits against our payable, a receivable balance of $69.4 million and $172.4 million was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively. As of October 2, 2022, deferred payroll tax payments of $116.5 million were included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. As of October 3, 2021, deferred payroll tax payments of $116.4 million were included in both accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $26.1 million and $30.9 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $104.7 million and $116.5 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs') or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return and metrics focused on building inclusive and diverse teams. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-ScholesMerton option valuation model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. If applicable, our total shareholder return relative to our peer group is incorporated into the underlying assumptions using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to calculate grant date fair value. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award, and only for those awards expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nOur international operations generally use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI on our consolidated balance sheets.",

Lowe's also includes its subsidiary list as Exhibit 21.1 in its 10-K, following a structured format that references prior filings for related exhibits. Tesla, in contrast, marks its subsidiary list (Exhibit 21.1) as 'Filed Herewith,' indicating it is newly submitted and not incorporated by reference from any previous filing.

      "answer": "BKNG contributed $55 million to its 401(k) savings plan in 2023, showing a steady increase from $40 million in 2022 and $32 million in 2021. NKE contributed $153 million to its 401(k) plan in fiscal year 2024, up from $136 million in 2023 and $126 million in 2022, indicating a consistent upward trend in employer support. TSLA introduced a matching program in January 2022, contributing 50% of employee contributions up to 6% of eligible compensation (capped at $3,000), with $99 million in expenses recognized for the 401(k) plan in 2023. Collectively, these figures reveal that BKNG and NKE have long-standing, growing commitments to employee retirement benefits, while TSLA has more recently formalized its approach with a structured matching model.",

The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at $100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0 billion thereafter (based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been achieved for the four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial statements filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of the exercise price of $70.01 per share, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five years post-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding.\n\nThe achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2021 is provided below.

      "answer": "HD primarily defines the ESPP in a glossary of terms, indicating it is an Employee Stock Purchase Plan but does not disclose financial or structural details. LOW provides detailed disclosures about its ESPP, including that the purchase price is 85% of the closing price, it recognizes share-based payment expense of $22 million in 2024, and issued 0.6 million shares under the plan. NKE reports ESPP-related compensation expenses of $69 million in 2024, showing a significant but smaller allocation compared to its overall stock-based compensation of $804 million. This reveals that while all three companies offer ESPPs, LOW and NKE provide more structured and quantifiable insights into their ESPPs, with LOW focusing on the liability treatment and NKE integrating it within a broader stock-based compensation framework, whereas HD only defines the term without financial context.",

The Company's share-based payment expense per share is equal to 15% of the closing price on the date of purchase.  The ESPP is considered a liability award and is measured at fair value at each reporting date, and the sharebased payment expense is recognized over the six-month offering period. Under the ESPP, the Company issued 0.6 million shares of common stock in 2024, and 0.7 million shares of common stock in 2023 and 2022, and recognized share-based payment expense of $22 million, $21 million, and $20 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 11: Employee Retirement Plans\n\nThe Company maintains a defined contribution retirement plan for eligible employees (the 401(k) Plan).  Eligible employees may participate in the 401(k) Plan the first of the month after thirty days of employment.  The Company makes contributions to the 401(k) Plan each payroll period, based upon a matching formula applied to employee deferrals (the Company Match).  Participants are eligible to receive the Company Match pursuant to the terms of the 401(k) Plan.  The Company Match varies based on how much the employee elects to defer up to a maximum of 4.25% of eligible compensation.  The Company Match is invested identically to employee contributions and is immediately vested.\n\nThe Company maintains a Benefit Restoration Plan to supplement benefits provided under the 401(k) Plan to participants whose benefits are restricted as a result of certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  This plan provides for employee salary deferrals and employer contributions in the form of a Company Match.\n\nThe Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation program called the Lowe's Cash Deferral Plan.  This plan is designed to permit certain employees to defer receipt of portions of their compensation, thereby delaying taxation on the deferral amount and on subsequent earnings until the balance is distributed.  This plan does not provide for Company contributions.\n\nThe Company recognized expense associated with these employee retirement plans of $172 million, $167 million, and $174 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 12: Income Taxes\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of the federal statutory tax  rate to the effective tax  rate:\n\n",

      "answer": "AMZN, HD, and LOW all face exposure to evolving Electronic Funds Transfer Rules, but each highlights different aspects of risk. AMZN emphasizes the potential for increased compliance costs due to enhanced authentication requirements and the risk of service disruption if third-party payment processors fail to comply or become unavailable. HD underscores the complexity and rising costs of maintaining adherence to changing data privacy and payment-related regulatory frameworks, including those governing electronic funds transfers. LOW focuses on the liability and operational risks tied to data breaches or non-compliance, such as fines, higher transaction fees, and loss of payment processing capabilities. Collectively, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies are subject to similar regulatory pressures, the nature and emphasis of their risks vary based on their payment infrastructure dependencies and cybersecurity postures.",

For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer cobranded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.\n\n## We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile\n\nWe have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as:\n\n- changes in interest rates;\n- conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in;\n- quarterly variations in operating results;\n- fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internet-related companies in particular;\n- changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels;\n- changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n- changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;\n- changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and\n- transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, social media activity, and speculation.\n\nVolatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n## Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business\n\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, satellite communications services, healthcare, and other products and services that we offer or sell.

Similarly, there may be increased activ ities by organized or coordinating groups of cyber criminals who seek to attack larger organizations' data or systems for their own aims and goals, which can include financial gain. Because the techniques threat actors use to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade serv ice, or sabotage systems, including use of stolen passwords, social engineering, phishing, smishing, v ishing, identity spoofing (including through the use of emerging technologies such as deep fakes), ransomware or other disruptiv e and destructiv e malware, supply chain compromises, insider threats, and man-in-the-middle and denial of serv ice attacks, change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of anomalous activ ity or compromise, we may be unable to anticipate or detect these techniques or implement adequate prev entativ e measures.\n\nThe ever-ev olv ing cybersecurity threat landscape means that we and our third-party serv ice prov iders and business partners must continually ev aluate and adapt our respectiv e systems and processes and ov erall security env ironment, as well as those of companies we or they acquire. There is no guarantee that the measures we take will be adequate to safeguard against all threats, including v ulnerabilities, data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data. As we hav e experienced in the past, any significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, job applicant, business partner, or Company data, could result in significant costs, including costs to inv estigate, mitigate, and remediate, as well as lost sales, fines, lawsuits, regulatory inv estigations, and damage to our reputation. Additionally, as we have experienced in the past, we or our third-party serv ice prov iders may not discov er any security breach, v ulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the occurrence of a security incident. When our systems or those of our third-party serv ice prov iders on which we rely are breached or attacked, we may also suffer, and on some occasions hav e suffered, an outage, failure, or unav ailability of data or information technology systems, and interruptions to our business operations while such breach or attack is being remedied; this may impact data or systems operated by us or by third-party serv ice prov iders. Furthermore, our cyber insurance cov erage may not be adequate for liabilities or costs actually incurred, and we cannot be certain that insurance will continue to be av ailable to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny cov erage of a future claim.\n\nData governance failures can also adv ersely affect our reputation and business. Our business depends on our customers', associates', job applicants', contractors', and business partners' willingness to entrust us with their personal information. Ev ents that adv ersely affect that trust, including inadequate disclosure to our customers, associates, job applicants, contractors, or business partners of our uses of their information or failing to keep our information technology systems and our customers', associates', job applicants', contractors', and business partners' personal information secure from significant attack, theft, damage, loss or unauthorized disclosure or access, whether as a result of our action or inaction (including human error or malfeasance) or that of our serv ice prov iders or other third parties, could adv ersely affect our brand and harm our reputation.\n\nThe regulatory env ironment related to data priv acy and cybersecurity is constantly changing, with new and increasingly rigorous requirements applicable to our business. The implementation of these requirements has also become more complex. Maintaining our adherence to ev olv ing data priv acy and cybersecurity regulatory requirements, including state priv acy laws, requires significant effort and cost, requires changes to our business practices, and may limit our ability to collect and use certain data for our business operations, including to support the customer experience. In addition, many regulators hav e indicated an intention to take more aggressiv e enforcement actions regarding data priv acy and cybersecurity matters, and priv ate litigation resulting from such matters is increasing and resulting in progressiv ely larger judgments and settlements. As we hav e experienced in the past, failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to fines, sanctions, gov ernmental inv estigations, or lawsuits, which could lead to negativ e publicity and reputational harm, and may cause customers to lose confidence in the effectiv eness of our cybersecurity measures, data priv acy practices, or our business more generally.\n\n## We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability, and potentially disrupt our business.\n\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit and debit cards, our PLCCs, cash, electronic payments, checks, digital wallets, loan programs including installment loans, trade credit, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options ov er time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules gov erning electronic funds transfers. These rules and requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult, costly, or uncertain. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange fees and other costs to accept these payments, and we may also incur losses, all of which may increase ov er time and raise our operating costs.",

These payment options subject us to many compliance requirements, including, but not limited to, compliance with payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, rules governing electronic funds transfers and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. They also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. Additionally, we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, gift cards, promotional financing, and other forms of electronic payment, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. National outages with our third-party credit and debit processor have resulted in lost sales and declined transactions after purchases. Future occurrences of such failures in third party systems are difficult to predict and may adversely affect our operations in unexpected ways.\n\nOur growing use of AI and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with algorithm development or use, the tools and data sets used and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment.\n\nWe currently leverage internally developed and third-party developed AI, including both predictive and generative AI-powered solutions, to facilitate a more efficient operation of our business and to enhance the experience of our customers. We have developed an AI framework designed to enhance the customer experience and unlock productivity across three pillars - how we sell, how we shop, and how we work. We use AI-powered solutions designed to enable quick and personalized customer interactions, design assistance platforms, and tools for better forecasting, sourcing, inventory planning, and faster fulfillment. We face risk of competitive disadvantage if our competitors more effectively use AI to better serve customers, drive internal efficiencies, and create new or enhanced products or services. Additionally, we are making investments to expand our AI capabilities in our business, including ongoing deployment and improvement of existing machine learning and AI technologies, as well as developing new features using AI technologies. We anticipate increased investments in the future to improve our use of AI, however, there can be no assurance that the development or usage of, or our investments in, AI will always enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business. Further, the rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment relating to AI and privacy could impact our implementation of AI technology and increase compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. Flaws, breaches, or malfunctions in these systems could lead to operational disruptions, data loss, erroneous decision-making, regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm, or legal liability.\n\n## Investment-Related Risks\n\nOur strategic transactions involve risks, and we may not realize the expected benefits because of numerous uncertainties and risks. We regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and other growth, market and geographic expansion strategies, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales, cost savings, synergies, and other various benefits. Our ability to deliver the ex pected benefits from any strategic transaction is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including our ability to integrate personnel, labor models, financial, IT and other systems successfully; disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; hiring additional management and other critical personnel; and increasing the scope, geographic diversity, and complexity of our operations. Effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports, and the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage. Integration of businesses into our internal control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Additionally, we have recognized material impairments in the past and may do so in the future, including in connection with assets we have acquired or divested in a strategic transaction or charges to earnings associated with any strategic transaction, which have and may in the future materially reduce our earnings. Our shareholders may react unfavorably to our strategic transactions and strategic transactions may also be subject to regulatory uncertainty due to the changing enforcement landscape. We may not",

      "question": "How do Home Depot, Lowe's, and Starbucks characterize supply chain risks to product availability differently in their 2023 annual filings, and what does this reveal about their operational vulnerabilities?",
      "answer": "Home Depot highlights that supply chain disruptions\u2014such as port congestion, labor disputes, and geopolitical conflicts\u2014have in the past and may again negatively affect the flow or availability of products, especially during periods of heightened demand like the COVID-19 pandemic. Lowe\u2019s similarly cites global health crises, geopolitical conflicts, and trade policy changes as risks that have affected and may continue to affect product availability, particularly due to reliance on international vendors. Starbucks, however, focuses on technology and cybersecurity risks, noting that disruptions in its IT systems or those of third-party partners could impair product availability and sales. While Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s emphasize physical supply chain and logistics challenges, Starbucks centers on digital infrastructure risks, revealing differing operational vulnerabilities: the former two face risks in tangible goods movement, while Starbucks\u2019 exposure lies in digital continuity and third-party dependencies.",

See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type, and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily include expenses related to raw materials, purchased goods, packaging, and delivery, along with operational costs of our supply chain organization. This encompasses wages, benefits, occupancy costs, and depreciation associated with sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Additionally, it includes costs related to inventory and supply chain asset impairments.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions, and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees, and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation",

Our objectiv e in managing these exposures is to decrease the v olatility of cash flows affected by changes in the underlying rates and minimize the risk of changes in the fair v alue of our senior notes.\n\nFair Value Hedges. We had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with combined notional amounts of $5.4 billion at both February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024. These agreements are accounted for as fair v alue hedges that swap fixed for v ariable rate interest to hedge changes in the fair v alues of certain senior notes. At February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024, the fair v alues of these agreements totaled $795 million and $858 million, respectiv ely, all of which are recognized in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAll of our interest rate swap agreements designated as fair v alue hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under GAAP. Accordingly, the changes in the fair v alues of these agreements offset the changes in the fair v alue of the hedged long-term debt.\n\nCash Flow Hedges. At February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges, which hedge the v ariability of forecasted cash flows associated with certain payments made in our foreign operations. At February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024, the notional amounts and the fair v alues of these contracts were not material. Additionally, the realized and unrealized gains and losses on these instruments were not material during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022.\n\nFrom time to time, we also use treasury locks or forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge the v ariability in future interest payments attributable to changing interest rates on forecasted debt issuances. There were no such instruments outstanding as of February 2, 2025 or January 28, 2024. All prev iously settled arrangements were designated as cash flow hedges and thus, the corresponding losses were initially recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss and are being amortized to interest expense ov er the life of the respectiv e notes. Unamortized losses remaining in accumulated other comprehensiv e loss were immaterial as of February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024, as were the losses recognized within interest expense for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022.\n\nWe expect an immaterial amount of losses related to cash flow hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensiv e loss as of February 2, 2025 to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.\n\nCollateral. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit our credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements that prov ide for collateral to be receiv ed or posted when the net fair v alue of certain deriv ativ e instruments exceeds or falls below contractually established thresholds. The cash collateral posted by the Company related to deriv ativ e instruments under our collateral security arrangements was $668 million and $714 million as of February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024, respectiv ely, which was recorded in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized a $22 million gain on the fair value of interest rate swaps, and a corresponding loss on the fair value of the related hedged debt instrument to interest expense.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nThe Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies), the Company uses foreign currency forwards to hedge a portion of anticipated exposures. The hedges cover up to the next 18 months for certain exposures and are denominated in various currencies. A s of December 31, 2024, the Company had derivatives outstanding with an equivalent notional amount of $2.0 billion that hedged a portion of forecasted foreign currency denominated cash flows.\n\nTo protect against the variability of interest rates on anticipated bond issuances, the Company may use treasury locks to hedge a portion of expected future cash flows. A s of December 31, 2024, the Company had derivatives outstanding with a notional amount of $500 million that hedge a portion of forecasted cash flows.\n\nBased on market conditions at December 31, 2024, the $119 million in cumulative cash flow hedging gains, after tax, is not expected to have a significant effect on earnings over the next 12 months.",

We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. For example, productivity across our fulfillment network is affected by regional labor market constraints, which increase payroll costs and make it difficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like.\n\nUnder some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to adequately predict seller demand for storage or to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.\n\nWe rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties ex perienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems, including as a result of labor market constraints and related costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or ex treme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events.\n\n## We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Incidents\n\nBecause we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, classified, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information, failure to prevent, detect, or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, or other security incidents or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors' or customers' technology, products, and systems, could: expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security incidents, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent, detect, or mitigate such incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security incident at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented.\n\n## We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy\n\nWe experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. Steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nOur computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures (including from energy shortages), and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.\n\n## The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business\n\nWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel, including our President and CEO. We do not have 'key person' life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate, as well as senior management, has historically been intense. For example, we experience",

Our public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customers shop at Lowe's, our vendors want to do business with Lowe's, and our associates want to work for Lowe's. We must continue to manage, preserve, and grow Lowe's public image and reputation. Lowe's actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation. In addition, failure to meet our stated environmental and social objectives, and consumer, shareholder, and other stakeholder concerns about our environmental and social practices are potential sources of reputational risk. V endors and others with whom we do business may affect our reputation. Any negative incident can erode trust and confidence quickly, and adverse publicity about us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers' confidence, reduce demand for our products and services, affect our relationships with current and future vendors, impact our results of operations, affect our ability to recruit, retain, and engage our associates, and attract regulatory scrutiny. The significant ex pansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incidents. We have been, and in the future may be, subject to criticism in the media and negative social media campaigns related to certain initiatives, including those related to diversity and inclusion, and changes in those initiatives. Widespread dissemination of such criticism at times may adversely impact our relationships with our associates, customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders. In addition, the use of social media platforms and other technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination and given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other actions.\n\nAdditionally, our proprietary rights in our trademarks, trade names, service marks, domain names, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets of our business. We may not be able to prevent or even discover every instance of unauthorized third-party uses of our intellectual property or dilution of our brand names, such as when a third party uses trademarks that are identical or similar to our own. If we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers, expose us to litigation and negatively impact our sales, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.\n\nProduct and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in Lowe's and our brand image. If our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety or quality, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial, and reputational risks. As a result, Lowe's reputation as a retailer of high-quality products and services, including both national and Lowe's private brands, could suffer and impact customer loyalty. Additionally, we and our customers have expectations on responsible sourcing and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Under our Vendor Code of Conduct, our vendors are required to meet our expectations across multiple areas of compliance, including health and safety, environmental standards, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. Where appropriate, we request that our vendors provide additional documentation proving their compliance in these areas. If we need to seek alternative sources of supply from vendors with whom we have less familiarity, the risk of our standards not being met may increase. Actual, potential, or perceived product safety concerns or vendor non-compliance exposes us to litigation, as well as government enforcement action, and could, and in certain instances in the past has, resulted in costly product recalls, the inability to sell certain products due to customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and exclusions, and other liabilities.\n\nOur sales and profitability depend on our ability to maintain our store base and maintain appropriate levels of inventory and failure to do so may affect our business, financial condition and result of operations.\n\nWe have a store base that requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. Our capital investments in our stores may not deliver the convenience or relevant shopping experience our customers expect. It is important that we maintain appropriate levels of inventory in our stores and supply chain facilities and respond to changing customer demands. We must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates, as well as to protect against loss or theft of our inventory (known as 'shrink'). Higher rates of shrink, which we have experienced from time to time, including as a result of organized retail crime, can require operational changes that may increase costs and adversely impact customer and associate experience.",

In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China, Germany and any future sites such as Mexico. We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our product ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets.\n\nWe have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and Solar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future products, features and services based on artificial intelligence. Likewise, we may encounter delays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products. In addition, as we continue to develop our artificial intelligence services and products, we may face many additional challenges, including the availability and cost of energy, processing power limitations and the substantial power requirements for our data centers.\n\nAny delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of our future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Our suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, or we may be unable to manage these components effectively.\n\nOur products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers, which exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages. Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, including inflation of raw material costs, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics, trade and shipping disruptions, port congestions, cyberattacks and other factors beyond our or our suppliers' control could also affect these suppliers' ability to deliver technologies or components to us or to remain solvent and operational. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, or face other challenges such as insolvency, it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our production or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time. We have faced in the past, and may face suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, which may increase our costs or require us to replace them with other sources. Finally, as we construct new manufacturing facilities and add production lines to existing facilities, we may experience issues in correspondingly increasing the level of localized procurement at those facilities. While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce, especially in the case of increases in materials pricing. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\nAs the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which may harm our business and operating results.\n\n## We may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines, costs and production ramps at new factories, or we may experience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there.\n\nOur ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future factories.

The indentures also contain a provision that allows the holders of the notes to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of their notes if a change of control triggering event occurs. If elected under the change of control provisions, the repurchase of the notes will occur at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, if any, on such notes up to the date of purchase. The indentures governing the notes do not limit the aggregate principal amount of debt securities that the Company may issue and do not require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios or levels of net worth or liquidity. However, the indentures include various restrictive covenants, none of which is expected to impact the Company's liquidity or capital resources.\n\nThe discounts associated with these issuances, which include the underwriting and issuance discounts, are recorded in long-term debt and are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes using the effective interest method.\n\nDuring 2020, the Company completed cash tender offers to purchase and retire $3.0 billion combined aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes with a weighted average interest rate of 4.80%. As a result of the 2020 cash tender offers, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.1 billion which includes premium paid to holders of the debt, unamortized deferred financing fees and original issue discounts, and loss on reverse treasury lock derivative contracts. See Note 9 for additional information regarding the reverse treasury lock derivative contracts.\n\n## NOTE 9: Derivative Instruments\n\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\n\nThe notional amounts of the Company's material derivative instruments are as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "Lowe's emphasizes that social media has 'compounded the potential scope of negative publicity' and highlights the importance of managing public image and reputation to maintain customer trust and vendor relationships. McDonald's notes that adverse commentary on social media or conventional media regarding the quick-service category or its brand, culture, operations, suppliers, or franchisees can impact consumer perceptions and financial results. Nike states that social media 'accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity,' increasing the challenges of responding to negative claims, and that it markets its products globally through diverse advertising, including social media, mobile apps, and online platforms. Collectively, these perspectives show that all three companies view social media as a powerful force in shaping brand perception, but each tailors its approach based on industry-specific risks and marketing strategies.",

          "chunk_text": "We have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our merchandising, marketing and distribution strategies effectively, or if they develop a substantially more effective or lower cost means of meeting customer needs, resulting in a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small, direct and indirect competitors. The principal competitive factors in our industry include convenience, customer service and experience, quality and price of merchandise and services, in-stock levels, and merchandise assortment and presentation. We face growing competition from online and omnichannel retailers who have a similar product or service offering. Customers are increasingly able to quickly comparison shop and determine real-time product availability and price using digital tools. Further, online and omnichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, as customers are increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times, including same-day and next-day fulfillment, low-price or free shipping, and convenient pick-up options, including curbside pickup, in-store pick-up, and buy online pick-up in-store (BOPIS) lockers, and we must make investments to keep up with our customers' evolving shopping preferences. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times, delivery costs, and delivery options depends on many factors, including successful implementation and the continued maintenance of our initiatives related to supply chain transformation, including our market-based delivery model. Our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance. Moreover, changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors, including the effects of competitor liquidation activities, may impact our results.\n\nIf we fail to hire, train, manage, and retain qualified associates with expanded skill sets or corporate support staff with the capabilities of delivering on strategic objectives, we could lose sales to our competitors, and our labor costs, resulting from operations or the execution of corporate strategies, could be negatively affected.\n\nOur customers, whether they are homeowners, renters or commercial businesses, expect our associates to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide. We compete with other retailers for many of our associates, and we are experiencing an unusually competitive labor market. Wages are increasing across the United States, and competitors are offering higher compensation than before, due to labor market conditions. Many associates are in entrylevel or part-time roles with historically high turnover rates, which has led to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market. Increasingly, our sales associates must have expanded skill sets, including, in some instances, the ability to do in-home or telephone sales. We need to attract and retain a diverse workforce that can deliver relevant, culturally competent and differentiated experiences for a wide variety of culturally diverse customers. Additionally, in order to deliver on the omnichannel expectations of our customers, we rely on the specialized training and capabilities of corporate support staff, which are broadly sought after by our competitors. Further, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including management transitions within the Company's senior leadership are critical to our business success. If we are unable to hire, train, manage, and retain qualified associates and specialists, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our results of operations could be negatively affected.\n\nFurthermore, our ability to meet our labor needs, particularly in a competitive labor market, while controlling our costs is subject to a variety of external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the availability of and competition for talent, health care and other benefit costs, our brand image and reputation, changing demographics and the adoption of new or revised legislation or regulations governing immigration, employment, labor relations, minimum wage, and health care benefits. Periodically, we are subject to labor organizing efforts, and if we become subject to collective bargaining agreements in the future, it could affect how we operate our business and adversely affect our labor costs. In addition to our United States and Canada operations, we have support offices in India and China, and any extended disruption of our operations in our different locations, whether due to labor difficulties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nPositively and effectively managing our public image and reputation is critical to our business success, and, if our public image and reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers, vendors, and associates and, consequently, our business and results of operations.\n\nOur public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customers shop at Lowe's, our vendors want to do business with Lowe's, and our associates want to work for Lowe's. We must continue to manage, preserve and grow Lowe's public image and reputation. Lowe's actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation. In addition, failure to meet our stated environmental and social goals, and consumer and investor concerns about our environmental and social practices are potential sources of reputational risk. In addition, vendors and others with whom we do business may affect our reputation. Any negative incident can erode trust and confidence quickly, and adverse publicity about us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers' confidence, reduce demand for our products and services, affect our relationships with current and future vendors, impact our results of operations, affect our ability to recruit, retain, and engage our associates, and attract regulatory scrutiny. The significant expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incidents.",

The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business. If any of these risks materialize or intensify, our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change and our performance may be adversely affected.\n\n## GLOBAL PANDEMIC\n\n## The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect our financial results, condition and outlook.\n\nHealth epidemics or pandemics can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply availability and costs, as well as the local operations in impacted markets, all of which can affect our financial results, condition and outlook. Importantly, the global pandemic resulting from COVID-19 has disrupted global health, economic and market conditions, consumer behavior and McDonald's global restaurant operations since early 2020, and has resulted in increased pressure on labor availability and supply chain management. Local and national governmental mandates or recommendations and public perceptions of the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have caused, and we expect will continue to cause, consumer behavior to change, worsening or volatile economic conditions in certain markets, and increased regulatory complexity and compliance costs, each of which could continue to adversely affect our business. In addition, our global operations have been disrupted to varying degrees in different markets and may continue to be disrupted to varying degrees given the unpredictability of the virus, its resurgences and variants and government responses thereto as well as potentially permanent changes to the industry in which we operate. While we cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, the resurgence of infections or the emergence of new variants in one or more markets, the availability, acceptance or effectiveness of vaccines or vaccination rates across the globe, the pandemic has negatively impacted our business and is expected to continue to impact our financial results, condition and outlook in a way that may be material.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also heighten other risks disclosed in these Risk Factors, including, but not limited to, those related to labor availability and costs, supply chain interruptions, commodity costs, consumer behavior, consumer perceptions of our brand and competition.\n\n## STRATEGY AND BRAND\n\n## If we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, including the Accelerating the Arches strategy, we may not be able to drive business growth.\n\nTo drive Systemwide sales, operating income and free cash flow growth, our business strategies must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal and capturing additional market share. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our System's ability to:\n\n- capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages, such as our marketing, core menu items and digital, delivery and drive thru;\n- continue to innovate and differentiate the McDonald's experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;\n- accelerate technology investments for a fast and easy customer experience;\n- continue to run great restaurants by driving efficiencies and expanding capacities while continuing to prioritize health and safety;\n- identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants;\n- accelerate our existing strategies, including through growth opportunities and potential acquisitions, investments and partnerships; and\n- evolve and adjust our business strategies in response to, among other things, changing consumer behavior, operational restrictions and impacts to our results of operations and liquidity, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIf we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## Failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nTo be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand, including our corporate purpose, mission and values. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions, which are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, the manner in which we source commodities and general business practices across the System, including the people practices at McDonald's restaurants. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health, environmental and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the 'informal eating out' ('IEO') segment or perceptions of our brand, generally or relative to available alternatives. Our business could also be impacted by business incidents or practices, whether actual or perceived, particularly if they receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, as well as by our position or perceived lack of position on environmental, social responsibility, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the IEO segment or our brand, culture, operations, suppliers or franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary or perceptions, whether or not accurate, our brand and financial results may suffer.",

Negative publicity relating to a violation or an alleged violation of policies or laws by such suppliers could damage our brand image and diminish consumer trust in our brand. Further, our reputation and brand image could be damaged as a result of our support of, association with or lack of support or disapproval of certain social causes, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct, or change, certain of our activities in response to such considerations. Social media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could also damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. If the reputation, culture or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity, then our sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n## Our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results.\n\nWe experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time or in the future as a result of strategic shifts in our business, changes in COVID-19 related cancellations or postponements and seasonal or geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing, cancellation or postponement of significant sporting events, such as the NBA Finals, Olympics or the World Cup, among others. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, outbreaks of disease, social or political unrest, availability of import quotas, transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period.\n\n## If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits.\n\nOur success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media, mobile applications and online advertising. If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## We rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our products.\n\nTechnical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing processes of footwear, apparel, equipment and other products and services are essential to the commercial success of our products and development of new products. Research and development play a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, digital technologies, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting-edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance and reduce injury and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems and loss of consumer confidence.\n\n## Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could harm our business.\n\nWe establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, as well as other public figures, including artists, designers and influencers, to develop, evaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with consumers. However, as competition in our industry has increased, the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased. If we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, or other public figures, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the high visibility or\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 14",

          "chunk_text": "Recent regulations and policies impacting the way corporations use Cookies and other tracking technologies could negatively impact the way we do business.\n\nThere are several privacy-driven initiatives that are changing the gathering and use of consumer data in the digital marketing ecosystem. These include phasing out the use of third-party cookies (and other tracking technologies) by browsers such as Safari and Google Chrome, restrictions on the use of the identifier for advertisers (such as the Apple \"IDFA\") by mobile device manufacturers, the adoption of regulations by many jurisdictions that govern the use of cookies, and Apple's iCloud+ Private Relay, which hides a user's IP address from websites that the user accesses in favor of other IP addresses provided by Apple's partners. A cookie is a text file that is stored on a user's computer or mobile device. An identifier, such as Apple's IDFA, is a unique device identifier assigned by the mobile device manufacturer which allows advertisers to recognize users across multiple mobile apps. An IP address can provide geographic and other connection information to websites related to the devices a user utilizes to connect to a website's servers. Cookies, IP addresses, and other tracking technologies are common tools used by thousands of websites and mobile apps, including ours, to, among other things, store or gather data (e.g., remember log-on details so a user does not have to re-enter them when revisiting a website or opening an app), market to consumers, and enhance the user experience.\n\nGoogle Chrome has announced that they will not permit the use of third-party cookies on Chrome starting in mid-2023 and other browsers have already stopped their use. Apple has begun to require app developers to gain consent to use the IDFA and other identifiers with their own consent framework. Apple's paying iCloud customers who update to current versions of iOS, iPadOS and OS X have access to the new iCloud+ Private Relay when using the Safari browser to hide such user's IP address from websites. Many jurisdictions, including the European Union and California, have adopted regulations governing the use of cookies. While these initiatives will likely impact a small portion of our digital advertising practices, these changes are not unique to the digital advertising at our Company. While we believe that our primary performance marketing spend will not be directly impacted by these changes, we are poised to utilize alternative digital marketing techniques for the portion of our marketing spend that could be impacted. To the extent any of these restrictions and regulations impair our ability to serve certain customers in the most optimal manner or if we are less effective than our competitors in addressing this change, our ability to continue to improve and optimize performance on our platforms, our business, market share, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, any failure to comply with these privacy regulations could result in fines and harm to our reputation.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\nOur liquidity, credit ratings, and ongoing access to capital could be materially and negatively affected by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOur continued access to sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including global economic conditions, the condition of global financial markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our ability to meet debt covenant requirements, our operating performance, and our credit ratings. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been increased volatility in the financial and securities markets, which has generally made access to capital less certain. Further, if our credit ratings were to be downgraded or if financing sources were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels, our industry or us, our access to capital, and the cost of any financing would be negatively impacted. We currently have $2.0 billion available under our revolving credit facility, which provides an additional potential source of liquidity. The revolving credit facility contains certain financial covenants, compliance with which is a condition to our ability to borrow thereunder. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the covenant requirements at any particular time, and our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility depends on such compliance. Further, the lenders have the right to require repayment of any amounts borrowed under the facility if we are not in compliance.\n\nThere is no guarantee that additional debt financing will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that it will be available on commercially reasonable terms, in which case we may need to seek other sources of funding. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants, which could restrict our business operations. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information on our liquidity and capital resources.\n\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nWe conduct a substantial majority of our business outside the United States but we report our results in U.S. Dollars. As a result, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results of our businesses outside of the U.S. are translated from local currency (principally Euros and British Pounds Sterling) into U.S. Dollars.

Certain  of  GM  Financial's  secured  debt  agreements  also  contain  various  covenants,  including  maintaining  portfolio performance ratios as well as limits on deferment levels. GM Financial's unsecured debt obligations contain covenants including limitations on GM Financial's ability to incur certain liens. Failure to meet certain of these requirements may result in a covenant violation or an event of default depending on the terms of the agreement. An event of default may allow lenders to declare amounts outstanding under these agreements immediately due and payable, to enforce their interests against collateral pledged under these agreements  or  restrict  our  ability  or  GM  Financial's  ability  to  obtain  additional  borrowings.  No  technical  defaults  or  covenant violations existed at December 31, 2021.\n\n## Note 14.

Nike specifically calls out copyright protection for its designs, graphics, and digital goods, aligning this with brand identity and consumer engagement through digital platforms. Tesla highlights copyrights as one of several tools used to safeguard innovations in electric vehicle software and infotainment systems, while also promoting open access to patents to accelerate industry-wide growth. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies rely on copyrights for competitive advantage, they apply them differently: Amazon focuses on digital infrastructure, Nike on brand-driven design and digital experiences, and Tesla on software innovation within a broader open patent framework.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Competition\n\nOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including onpremises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers' ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth's most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,608,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for personnel across other parts of our business.\n\nAs we strive to be Earth's best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and develop the best talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (funded education for hourly employees) and the Amazon Technical Academy (software development engineer training). We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.",

          "chunk_text": "legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules and (iii) reflects and considers domestic economies and the important role they may play in the global economic community.\n\nWhere trade protection measures are implemented, we believe we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability.\n\nOur international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or \"FCPA\", and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. We source a significant portion of our products from, and have important consumer markets, outside of the United States. We have an ethics and compliance program to address compliance with the FCPA and similar laws by us, our employees, agents, suppliers and other partners. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information on risks relating to our international operations.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment, including adidas, Anta, ASICS, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, Puma, Under Armour and V.F. Corporation, among others. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.\n\nNIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. Important aspects of competition in this industry are:\n\n- Product attributes such as quality; performance and reliability; new product style, design, innovation and development; as well as consumer price/value.\n- Consumer connection, engagement and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing, promotion and digital experiences; social media interaction; customer support and service; identification with prominent and influential athletes, influencers, public figures, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics.\n- Effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and on digital platforms.\n\nWe believe that we are competitive in all of these areas.\n\n## TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS\n\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success and our competitive position. We strategically pursue available protections of these rights and vigorously protect them against third-party theft and infringement.\n\nWe use trademarks on nearly all of our products and packaging, and in our marketing materials, and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh Design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 190 jurisdictions worldwide. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we use in marketing our products. We own common law rights in the trade dress of several distinctive shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have sought and obtained trademark registrations.\n\nWe have copyright protection in our designs, graphics, software applications, digital goods and other original works. When appropriate, we also obtain registered copyrights.\n\nWe file for, own and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility and design patents protecting components, technologies, materials, manufacturing techniques, features, functionality, and industrial designs used in and for the manufacture of various athletic, performance, and leisure footwear and apparel, including physical and digital versions thereof, athletic equipment, and digital devices, and related software applications. These patents expire at various times.\n\nWe believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing and is supported and protected by our intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, utility and design patents, copyrights, and trade secrets, among others.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 5",

          "chunk_text": "We believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology. For example, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3 and Model Y compete with small to medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs, which are extremely competitive markets. Competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers; however, many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions, including the introduction of electric vehicles into rental car company fleets, promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to the internal combustion vehicle. Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today in major markets including the U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions.\n\nWe also believe that there is increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering self-driving technologies, charging solutions and other features and services, and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our Autopilot, FSD and neural network capabilities, Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage\n\n## Energy Storage Systems\n\nThe market for energy storage products is also highly competitive, and both established and emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems. We compete with these companies based on price, energy density and efficiency. We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage products give us a competitive advantage in our markets.\n\n## Solar Energy Systems\n\nThe primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers. We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nWe place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio. As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other measures, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs within our products and technologies in the electric vehicle market as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other companies making electric vehicles and the world.\n\n## Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital Resources\n\n## ESG\n\nThe very purpose of Tesla's existence is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe the world cannot reduce carbon emissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption, and we are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation ecosystem to achieve this goal. As we expand, we are building each new factory to be more efficient and sustainably designed than the previous one, including with respect to waste reduction and water usage, and we are focused on reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain.\n\nWe are committed to only sourcing responsibly produced materials, and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that ensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, as well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing into their supply chains. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and we look to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and external stakeholders to find ways to continually improve. We are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement. As our production volumes increase, our incidents per vehicle continue to drop.",

Starbucks issues SARs as part of its equity incentive plans and had 83.2 million shares available for future equity-based compensation awards as of September 29, 2024. Tesla includes SARs in its 2019 Equity Incentive Plan and had 131.1 million shares reserved for issuance under the plan as of December 31, 2023.

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, supply chain constraints affected Amazon, Nike, and Starbucks in distinct operational areas. Amazon cited global supply chain constraints as a factor increasing carrier rates and fulfillment network inefficiencies, impacting cost structures. Nike experienced a $2,183 million increase in inventories due to supply chain disruptions, which limited available inventory to meet consumer demand. Starbucks saw a 340 basis point decline in operating margin within its Channel Development segment due to inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints. Together, these disclosures show that while all three companies faced supply chain challenges, the effects manifested differently\u2014Amazon through fulfillment costs, Nike through inventory buildup, and Starbucks through margin compression.",

These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Segment Information.'\n\n## Overview\n\nAs reflected in the discussion below, ongoing direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken in response to them had varying effects on our 2021 results of operations, although some effects, including customer demand, are mitigating or becoming more difficult to isolate or quantify. Moreover, it is not possible to determine the duration and scope of the pandemic, the scale and rate of economic recovery from the pandemic, any ongoing effects on consumer demand and spending patterns, supply chain disruptions, and labor availability and costs, or the impact of other indirect factors that may be attributable to the pandemic, and the extent to which these or other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations. However, we expect our net sales growth rate to decelerate in Q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in Q1 2021. In addition, these direct and indirect factors can make it difficult to isolate and quantify the portion of our costs that are a direct result of the pandemic and costs arising from factors that may have been influenced by the pandemic, including increased wage rates and incentives, increased carrier rates, and fulfillment network inefficiencies resulting from constrained labor markets and global supply chain constraints. We expect these factors and their effects on our operations to continue into Q1 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## CASH FLOW ACTIVITY\n\nCash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $5,188 million for fiscal 2022 compared to $6,657 million for fiscal 2021. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $6,848 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2022 compared to $6,612 million for fiscal 2021. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease to Cash provided (used) by operations of $1,660 million for fiscal 2022, compared to an increase of $45 million for fiscal 2021. The net change in working capital was unfavorably impacted by a $2,183 million increase in Inventories, partially offset by a favorable impact from a $1,102 million decrease in Accounts receivable. These changes were, in part, due to supply chain constraints, which caused higher levels of in-transit inventory and therefore a lower supply of available inventory to meet consumer demand.\n\nCash provided (used) by investing activities was an outflow of $1,524 million for fiscal 2022, compared to an outflow of $3,800 million for fiscal 2021, primarily driven by the net change in short-term investments. During fiscal 2022, the net change in short-term investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash outflow of $747 million compared to a cash outflow of $3,276 million in fiscal 2021. Additionally, during fiscal 2022, we continued investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, specifically focused around digital capabilities, our end-to-end technology foundation, our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain. In future periods, we expect to make annual capital expenditures of approximately 3% of annual revenues.\n\nCash provided (used) by financing activities was an outflow of $4,836 million for fiscal 2022 compared to an outflow of $1,459 million for fiscal 2021. This change was driven by our resumption of the share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, resulting in $4,014 million of share repurchases during fiscal 2022 compared to $608 million during fiscal 2021.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we purchased 27.3 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $3,994 million (an average price of $146.11 per share) under the four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018. As of May 31, 2022, we had repurchased 77.4 million shares at a cost of $8,663 million (an average price of $111.98 per share) under this program. In June 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new four-year, $18 billion program to repurchase shares of the Company's Class B common stock. The new program will replace the current $15 billion share repurchase program, which will be terminated in fiscal 2023. Repurchases under the new program will be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The new share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended at any time at our discretion. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows and excess cash. The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.\n\n## CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nOn July 23, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement (the 'Shelf') with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 23, 2022, and we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the SEC in July 2022.\n\nOn March 11, 2022, we entered into a 364-day committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $1.5 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 10, 2023, with an option to extend the maturity date an additional 364 days. This facility replaces the prior $1 billion 364-day credit facility agreement entered into on March 15, 2021, which would have matured on March 14, 2022. Refer to Note 7 - Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information.\n\nOn March 11, 2022, we also entered into a five-year committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $3 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 11, 2027, with options to extend the maturity date up to an additional two years. This facility replaces the prior $2 billion five-year credit facility agreement entered into on August 16, 2019, which would have matured on August 16, 2024. Refer to Note 7 - Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information.\n\nWe currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. As it relates to our committed credit facilities entered into on March 11, 2022, if our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fees and interest rates would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fees and interest rates would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities. Under these facilities, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities, failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 45",

      "answer": "Home Depot notes that strategic transactions may be subject to significant regulatory uncertainty, which could result in additional costs or delays that affect the anticipated outcome of a transaction. Lowe's similarly highlights that strategic transactions may be subject to regulatory uncertainty due to the changing enforcement landscape, which could prevent the realization of anticipated benefits. Tesla emphasizes that political and regulatory uncertainty, especially concerning trade and the environment, compounds challenges in its automotive demand and operations. Each company identifies regulatory uncertainty as a risk factor that could delay or derail strategic initiatives, increase costs, or complicate integration, though Tesla frames the issue more broadly within macroeconomic and industry trends.",

As we attract and hire new associates, we strive to create a customer-like experience for jobseekers as they progress through the steps of our recruiting process by focusing on speed and personalization. We employ targeted marketing practices through our careers website, which personalizes the user's experience based on jobseeker location and searching behavior. Jobseekers can also apply for roles from anywhere using desktop or mobile devices. Once a jobseeker has applied for a role, we prioritize self-service by allowing candidates to schedule or reschedule interviews directly from their mobile device. Lastly, we created a quick hiring process for candidates by leveraging job-matching automation.\n\nWe offer all of our associates the opportunity to benefit from robust development opportunities. We invest in ongoing growth and development by integrating our culture and values into our performance management practices, providing coaching through continuous leader support, and empowering our associates to learn new skills at their own pace through mobile applications our associates can access at any time. We equip our leaders with the tools they need to develop themselves and their teams through several programs designed to help them lead inclusively, empower their teams, and serve as mentors for our associates.\n\nAssociate Engagement. Associate engagement is the emotional commitment associates have to The Home Depot. It is vital to our culture and to our success. We create an engaging workplace by continuously listening to and acting on associate feedback. We provide several pulse check surveys to groups of associates throughout the year that help us determine how emotionally connected those associates are to our customers, the Company, their jobs, fellow associates, and leaders.

Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, while decreasing our environmental impact.\n\nIn addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, digital technologies, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, physicians and other experts who consult with us and review certain designs, materials and concepts for product and manufacturing, design and other process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process.\n\nAs we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products and experiences incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories and consumer applications. Using market intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories to respond to consumer preferences. The proliferation of Nike Air, Zoom, Nike Free, Flywire, Dri-Fit, Flyknit, FlyEase, ZoomX, Air Max, Nike React and Nike Adapt technologies, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products.\n\n## MANUFACTURING\n\nVirtually all of our footwear and apparel products are manufactured outside the United States by independent manufacturers with whom we contract and refer to as 'contract manufacturers.' Many of these contract manufacturers operate multiple finished goods contract factories. We are also supplied, primarily indirectly, by a number of materials, or 'Tier 2,' suppliers, who provide the principal materials used in footwear and apparel finished goods products. As of May 31, 2022, we had 139 strategic Tier 2 suppliers.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 3",

      "answer": "HD highlighted that global supply chain disruptions, including port congestion, contributed to inflationary pressures that impacted merchandise costs and required careful price adjustments to avoid negatively affecting consumer demand or margins. LOW specifically noted that U.S. port capacity constraints and congestion, exacerbated by the pandemic, increased supply chain costs and created risks of inventory delays and out-of-stocks. Unlike LOW, which emphasized the direct operational impacts of port delays, HD focused more broadly on supply chain disruptions as a contributor to inflation and pricing challenges. This reveals that while both companies face risks from port congestion, LOW appears to be more operationally exposed due to its sourcing model and fulfillment complexity, whereas HD framed the issue within broader macroeconomic pressures.",

      "answer": "Home Depot acknowledges that the discontinuation of LIBOR will impact its interest rate swap agreements and credit arrangements but does not expect the adoption of ASU 2020-04 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. McDonald's also states that the adoption of ASU 2020-04 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements, aligning with its broader assessment of accounting pronouncements. Tesla adopted ASU 2020-04 during 2021 and, like the other two companies, does not expect the standard to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

Topic 832 requires disclosure of the nature of the transactions and the related accounting policy used, the line items on the balance sheet and income statement that are affected and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line item, and significant terms of the transactions. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2021-10 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nASU 2020-04. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,' which provides practical expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments in this update apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform. These amendments are not applicable to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022. ASU No. 2020-04 is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 and may be applied to contract modifications and hedging relationships from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020. While the discontinuance of LIBOR will impact our interest rate swap agreements and certain of our credit arrangements, we do not anticipate the transition to a new reference rate and adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nRecent accounting pronouncements adopted or pending adoption not discussed above are either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n## 2. NET SALES AND SEGMENT REPORTING\n\nWe currently conduct our retail operations in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, each of which represents one of our three operating segments. Our operating segments reflect the way in which internally-reported financial information is used to make decisions and allocate resources. For disclosure purposes, we aggregate these three operating segments into one reportable segment due to their similar operating and financial characteristics.\n\nThe following table presents net property and equipment, classified by geography:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees were not material either individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale.\n\n## CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily McDonald's China and Japan) are accounted for by the equity method.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the variable interest entity consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented.\n\n## ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\n\nGenerally, the functional currency of operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency.\n\n## RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standard Update ('ASU') No. 2019-12, 'Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes' ('ASU 2019-12'), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including applicable interim periods. The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2021. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\n## Reference Rate Reform\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\" ('ASU 2020-04'). The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2020-04 will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Leases\n\nIn July 2021, the FASB issued No. ASU 2021-05, \"Leases (Topic 842): Lessors-Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments\" (\"ASU 202105\"). The pronouncement amends the current guidance on classification for a lease that includes variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate. Under the amended guidance, a lessor must classify as an operating lease any lease that would otherwise be classified as a sales-type or direct financing lease and that would result in the recognition of a selling loss at lease commencement. ASU 2021-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including applicable interim periods. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.",

Under the 401(k) savings plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 90% of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. We did not make any contributions to the 401(k) savings plan during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (other than employee deferrals of eligible compensation). Beginning in January 2022, we will match 50% of each employee's contributions up to a maximum of 6% (capped at $3,000) of the employee's eligible compensation, vested upon one year of service.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If early adopted, the amendments are applied retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurred during the fiscal year of adoption. This ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832). This ASU requires business entities to disclose information about government assistance they receive if the transactions were accounted for by analogy to either a grant or a contribution accounting model. The disclosure requirements include the nature of the transaction and the related accounting policy used, the line items on the balance sheets and statements of operations that are affected and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line item and the significant terms and conditions of the transactions. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The disclosure requirements can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all transactions in the scope of the amendments that are reflected in the financial statements at the date of initial application and new transactions that are entered into after the date of initial application. The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Recently adopted accounting pronouncements\n\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The amendments in the ASU include removing exceptions to incremental intraperiod tax allocation of losses and gains from different financial statement components, exceptions to the method of recognizing income taxes on interim period losses, and exceptions to deferred tax liability recognition related to foreign subsidiary investments. In addition, the ASU requires that entities recognize franchise tax based on an incremental method and requires an entity to evaluate the accounting for step-ups in the tax basis of goodwill as inside or outside of a business combination. We adopted ASU 2019-12 starting 2021, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (Topic 848). The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate (e.g., LIBOR) reform if certain criteria are met, for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. The ASU is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. We continue to evaluate transactions or contract modifications occurring as a result of reference rate reform and determine whether to apply the optional guidance on an ongoing basis. We adopted ASU 2020-04 during 2021. The ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-04, Issuer's Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options. The ASU addresses the previous lack of specific guidance in the accounting standards codification related to modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (such as warrants) by specifying the accounting for various modification scenarios. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted for any periods after issuance to be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. We adopted the ASU during 2021 as of the beginning of our fiscal year, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.",

      "question": "How did the financial impacts of supply chain constraints in 2022 differ across Amazon's fulfillment costs, Starbucks' joint venture margins, and General Motors' manufacturing operations, based on their respective disclosures?",
      "answer": "Amazon reported that global supply chain constraints contributed to increased carrier rates and fulfillment network inefficiencies, which in turn affected their cost structure and were expected to persist into Q1 2022. Starbucks specifically cited supply chain constraints as a key factor that reduced its Channel Development operating margin by approximately 340 basis points due to lower income from its North American Coffee Partnership joint venture. General Motors, while not providing specific financial figures, acknowledged that supply chain disruptions impacted its manufacturing operations, particularly in relation to semiconductor shortages and logistics bottlenecks. Together, these disclosures show that while all three companies faced headwinds from supply chain issues, the financial manifestations varied: Amazon saw increased fulfillment costs, Starbucks experienced margin compression in joint ventures, and GM faced production limitations due to component shortages.",

These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 - Segment Information.'\n\n## Overview\n\nAs reflected in the discussion below, ongoing direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken in response to them had varying effects on our 2021 results of operations, although some effects, including customer demand, are mitigating or becoming more difficult to isolate or quantify. Moreover, it is not possible to determine the duration and scope of the pandemic, the scale and rate of economic recovery from the pandemic, any ongoing effects on consumer demand and spending patterns, supply chain disruptions, and labor availability and costs, or the impact of other indirect factors that may be attributable to the pandemic, and the extent to which these or other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations. However, we expect our net sales growth rate to decelerate in Q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in Q1 2021. In addition, these direct and indirect factors can make it difficult to isolate and quantify the portion of our costs that are a direct result of the pandemic and costs arising from factors that may have been influenced by the pandemic, including increased wage rates and incentives, increased carrier rates, and fulfillment network inefficiencies resulting from constrained labor markets and global supply chain constraints. We expect these factors and their effects on our operations to continue into Q1 2022.",

These increases were partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($21 million).\n\n## Operating Margin\n\nChannel Development operating income for fiscal 2022 increased 4% to $817 million, compared to $789 million in fiscal 2021. Operating margin decreased 520 basis points to 44.3%, primarily due to a decline in our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture income due to inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints (approximately 340 basis points) and business mix shift (approximately 170 basis points).",

      "question": "How do Amazon, Booking Holdings, and Starbucks each describe their approach to protecting intellectual property rights related to copyrights, and what does this reveal about the distinct roles copyrights play in their respective business models?",
      "answer": "Amazon describes its approach to copyrights as part of a broader strategy to protect critical intellectual property, stating that it has registered or applied for U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. This reflects a comprehensive and expansive effort to secure proprietary rights across its diverse business lines. Booking Holdings emphasizes its reliance on intellectual property such as trademarks, copyrights, patents, and trade secrets to support its business, and it has filed applications for protection in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. However, it highlights the risks associated with intellectual property in its risk factors, indicating a more cautious posture. Starbucks explicitly states that it owns numerous copyrights for product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics, and training materials, underscoring a more tangible and branding-focused application of copyright protection. These approaches reveal that Amazon treats copyrights as part of a broad, technology- and commerce-driven IP portfolio, Booking Holdings frames copyrights within a risk-aware legal framework, and Starbucks applies copyrights in a way that directly supports brand identity and in-store experience.",
