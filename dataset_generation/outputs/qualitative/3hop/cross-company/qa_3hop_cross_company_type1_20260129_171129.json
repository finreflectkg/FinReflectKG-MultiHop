Meanwhile, CVX holds a 15% interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), which transports an average of 1.4 million barrels of crude oil per day, with 1.2 million barrels sourced from Kazakhstan\u2014specifically from fields like Tengiz and Karachaganak in which Chevron operates or holds stakes. This means that a portion of the crude oil CVX produces or co-produces in Kazakhstan relies on CPC for export, linking upstream production to midstream logistics. Since crude oil is essential for XOM\u2019s business, any disruption in supply chains like CPC could impact the availability or cost of crude oil for companies downstream, including XOM.",

In contrast, CVX expanded its operational footprint in Florida by opening six new compressed natural gas (CNG) stations in 2024, signaling a strategic pivot toward cleaner energy infrastructure in a state where coal still contributes to energy generation as noted in Duke Energy Florida's inventory of $77 million in coal reserves.

On October 6, 2022, European Union ('EU') Member States adopted an EU Council Regulation which, along with other measures, introduced a new tax described as an emergency intervention to address high energy prices. This regulation imposed a mandatory tax on certain companies active in the crude petroleum, coal, natural gas, and refinery sectors. The regulation required EU Member States to levy a minimum 33 percent tax on inscope companies' 2022 and/or 2023 'surplus profits\", defined in the regulation as taxable profits exceeding 120 percent of the annual average profits during the 20182021 period. EU Member States were required to implement the tax, or an equivalent national measure, by December 31, 2022. The enactment of these regulations by EU Member States resulted in an after-tax charge of approximately $1.8 billion to the Corporation's fourth-quarter 2022 results and approximately $0.2 billion in 2023, mainly reflected in the line 'Income tax  ex pense (benefit)' on the Consolidated Statement of Income.",

At December 31, 2021, the company's carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $100 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO's net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO's net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the FGP/WPMP with a balance of $4,500.\n\nPetropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the heavy oil Huyapari Field and upgrading project in Venezuela's Orinoco Belt. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in the Petropiar affiliate and, effective July 1, 2020, began accounting for this venture as a non-equity method investment.\n\nPetroboscan Chevron  has  a  39.2  percent  interest  in  Petroboscan,  a  joint  stock  company  which  operates  the  Boscan  Field  in Venezuela.  In  2020,  the  company  fully  impaired  its  investments  in  the  Petroboscan  affiliate  and,  effective  July  1,  2020,  began accounting  for  this  venture  as  a  non-equity  method  investment.  The  company  also  has  an  outstanding  long-term  loan  to Petroboscan of $560, which has been fully provisioned for at year-end 2021.\n\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.\n\nAngola  LNG Limited Chevron  has  a  36.4  percent  interest  in Angola  LNG  Limited,  which  processes  and  liquefies  natural  gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. The other half is owned by Phillips 66.\n\nGS Caltex Corporation Chevron owns 50 percent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy in South Korea. The joint venture imports, refines and markets petroleum products, petrochemicals and lubricants.",

      "question": "How does the expiration timeline of Exxon's exploration and production rights in Mozambique's Rovuma Block compare to Chevron's overall reserve additions and production performance in Africa between 2019 and 2021?",
      "answer": "Exxon's exploration and production rights in Mozambique's Rovuma Block (Area 4) expire 30 years after an approved development plan becomes effective. This long-term horizon aligns with major LNG development timelines. In contrast, Chevron's African reserves in 2021 stood at 106 million barrels, showing only modest growth from 100 million in 2019 despite $210 million in reserve additions through purchases and discoveries. Chevron's African production declined slightly from 4 million barrels in 2019 to 3 million in 2021, indicating limited growth in the region despite stable reserve levels.",

        "Hop 1: CVX \u2192 Exploration and Production Activities: Chevron's African reserves grew slightly from 100 million barrels (2019) to 106 million (2021), with $210 million in additions through discoveries and purchases, but production declined slightly.",

          "chunk_text": "Production  rights  granted  prior  to  January  1,  2003,  remain  subject  to  their  existing  terms,  and  differ  slightly  for  onshore  and offshore  areas.  Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

      "question": "How does the ownership structure of Map Ta Phut Olefins Company Limited, in which Chevron operates a refinery, compare to ExxonMobil's concession terms in Thailand, and what implications does this have for long-term operational control in the region?",
      "answer": "Chevron operates a refinery in Map Ta Phut, Thailand, with an operable capacity of 175 thousand barrels per day. Dow Chemical holds a 32.77% ownership interest in Map Ta Phut Olefins Company Limited, indicating a joint venture structure where Chevron does not have majority control. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil operates under Thailand's Petroleum Act of 1971, which grants production rights for 30 years with a 10-year extension, allowing ExxonMobil more predictable long-term control over its concessions. This contrast suggests that while Chevron's refining operations in Thailand are subject to shared control through joint ventures, ExxonMobil enjoys more direct and legally secured long-term operational rights under the country's concession framework.",

The initial terms for these rights generally extend for 25 years. Ex tensions and terms are subject to State of Qatar approval.\n\n## Thailand\n\nThe Petroleum Act of 1971 allows production under ExxonMobil's concessions for 30 years with a 10-year extension at terms generally prevalent at the time.\n\n## United Arab Emirates\n\nAn interest in the development and production activities of the offshore Upper Zakum field was acquired in 2006. In 2017, the governing agreements were extended to 2051.\n\n## Australia / Oceania\n\n## Australia\n\nExploration and production activities conducted offshore in Commonwealth waters are governed by Federal legislation. Exploration permits are granted for an initial term of six  years with two possible five-year renewal periods. Retention leases may be granted for resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application but are likely to become commercially viable within 15 years. These are granted for periods of five years, and renewals may be requested. Prior to July 1998, production licenses were granted initially for 21 years, with a further renewal of 21 years and thereafter indefinitely, i.e., for the life of the field. Effective from July 1998, new production licenses are granted indefinitely. In each case, a production license may be terminated if no production operations have been carried on for five years.\n\n## Papua New Guinea\n\nExploration and production activities are governed by the Oil and G as Act. Petroleum prospecting licenses are granted for an initial term of six years with a fiveyear extension possible (an additional extension of three years is possible in certain circumstances). G enerally, a 50-percent relinquishment of the license area is required at the end of the initial six -year term, if ex tended. Petroleum development licenses are granted for an initial 25-year period. An extension for further consecutive period(s) of up to 20 years may be granted at the Petroleum Minister's discretion. Petroleum retention licenses may be granted for gas resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application but may become commercially viable within the maximum possible retention time of 15 years. Petroleum retention licenses are granted for an initial five-year period, and may only be extended, at the Minister's discretion, twice for the maximum retention time of 15 years.",

      "question": "How does the change in CVX's African oil reserves from 2019 to 2021 compare to XOM's offshore acreage in Angola, given the regulatory framework governing exploration and production activities in Angola?",
      "answer": "CVX's African oil reserves increased from 100 million barrels in 2019 to 106 million barrels in 2021, reflecting a net growth of 6 million barrels over two years. In contrast, XOM reported no specific reserves data for Angola but held 2.9 million net offshore acres in Angola at year-end 2021. Angola's regulatory framework allows for exploration and production activities governed by production sharing agreements with exploration terms ranging from 3 to 4 years (extendable by 1\u20135 years) and production periods ranging from 20 to 30 years. This regulatory flexibility likely supports long-term development of CVX's reserves and XOM's acreage in the region.",

        "Hop 1: CVX \u2192 Exploration and Production Activities: CVX's African oil reserves increased from 100 million barrels in 2019 to 106 million barrels in 2021, indicating growth in its upstream portfolio in the region.",
        "Hop 2: Exploration and Production Activities \u2192 Angola: Angola regulates exploration and production activities through production sharing agreements with exploration terms of 3\u20134 years (extendable) and production periods of 20\u201330 years.",
        "Hop 3: Angola \u2190 XOM: XOM held 2.9 million net offshore acres in Angola at year-end 2021, suggesting significant upstream exposure in a jurisdiction with structured licensing terms."

          "chunk_text": "Production  rights  granted  prior  to  January  1,  2003,  remain  subject  to  their  existing  terms,  and  differ  slightly  for  onshore  and offshore  areas.  Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

      "answer": "Chevron experienced a net decrease of 107 million BOE in proved undeveloped reserves at TCO in Kazakhstan due to performance-driven reservoir model changes. TCO operates in Kazakhstan under a concession agreement and is developing major projects like the Future Growth Project (FGP) and Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP), with FGP expected to start-up in first half 2025. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil reported its long-lived asset value in Kazakhstan at $7,728 million for 2023, indicating a continued but reduced investment presence in the country. The decline in Chevron's reserves may affect its production capacity in Kazakhstan, especially before new projects come online, while ExxonMobil's asset valuation suggests a more stable but scaled-back footprint in the region.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips has a maximum potential liability of $116 million tied to its guarantees for Alba Plant LLC, which processes condensate and LPG from the Alba Unit under a fixed-rate long-term contract. Chevron, as a major producer of condensate with 2,121 million barrels reported in proved developed reserves in the U.S. in 2024, supplies this raw material that feeds into the Alba Plant LLC\u2019s operations. This processing arrangement directly supports the revenue stream from which ConocoPhillips receives a share, linking its financial exposure through guarantees to the condensate volumes produced by Chevron and processed at Alba Plant LLC.",

With the acquisition, we have increased our global operations adding oil, natural gas and LNG activity in Equatorial Guinea to our portfolio. See Note 3.\n\nWe have varying stages of oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in Equatorial Guinea. We operate in both the Alba and Block D PSCs that form the Alba Unit located offshore Equatorial Guinea.\n\n## Gas Processing\n\nThe following facilities located on Bioko Island allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the Alba Unit and are accounted for as equity method i nvestments and are reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement.\n\nWe own a 52.2 percent interest in the Alba Plant LLC, our joint venture with Chevron Corporation (27.8 percent) and Sociedad Nacional de Gas de Guinea Ecuatorial (SONAGAS) (20.0 percent), which operates an onshore liquified petroleum gas (LPG) processing plant. Alba Plant LLC processes Alba Unit natural gas under a fixed-rate long-term contract. The LPG processing plant extracts condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and sells it at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement. Processed natural gas is delivered to Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited (EG LNG) for liquefaction and storage. We market our share of LNG to third parties indexed at global LNG prices.\n\nWe own a 56.0 percent interest in EG LNG, our joint venture with SONAGAS (37.9 percent) and Marubeni Gas Development UK Limited (6.1 percent), which operates a 3.7 MTPA LNG production facility. In January 2024, we began a five-year LNG sales agreement for a portion of our equity gas from the Alba Unit, providing us with additional exposure to the European LNG market.\n\nWe own a 45.0 percent interest in Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (AMPCO), our joint venture with Chevron Corporation (45.0 percent) and SONAGAS (10.0 percent), which operates a methanol plant. The plant is currently offline.\n\nAdditionally, Alba Plant LLC and EG LNG process third-party gas from the Alen Field under a combination of tolling fee and profit-sharing arrangements which are reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement.",

The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips relies heavily on crude oil as a core raw material, making its operations sensitive to disruptions in transportation infrastructure. Chevron's 15% ownership in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) highlights the strategic importance of this pipeline in crude oil logistics, particularly for production from western Kazakhstan and Russia. In 2023, the CPC transported an average of 1.4 million barrels of crude oil per day, and its debottlenecking project was completed to increase throughput capacity in support of new upstream projects. If ConocoPhillips has upstream exposure in this region or depends on similar transportation routes, any constraints or disruptions in the CPC pipeline could directly impact its crude oil supply chain, affecting production timelines and increasing logistical costs.",

ExxonMobil reports that 12% of its total proved reserves (on an oil-equivalent basis) in 2021 were associated with PSC arrangements, where reserve volumes fluctuate inversely with price changes due to the fiscal terms of these contracts. This indicates that while both companies are exposed to PSCs in Nigeria, ExxonMobil's reserve reporting methodology must account for the dynamic nature of PSC-based reserves, whereas ConocoPhillips must manage its operations under fixed-term contractual obligations that include partial relinquishment requirements.",

Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month  price  for  each  month  within  such  period.  These  reserves  quantities  are  also  used  in  calculating  unit-ofproduction depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the  evaluation  or  re-evaluation  of  (1)  already  available  geologic,  reservoir  or  production  data,  (2)  new  geologic,  reservoir  or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of  reserves.  Revisions  can  also  result  from  significant  changes  in  either  development  strategy  or  production  equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved  reserves  include  100  percent  of  each  majority-owned  affiliate's  participation  in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's ownership percentage  of  the  proved  reserves  of  equity  companies,  but  exclude  royalties  and  quantities  due  others.  Natural  gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2021 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 12 percent  on  an  oil-equivalent  basis  (natural  gas  is  converted  to  an  oil-equivalent  basis  at  six  billion  cubic  feet  per  one  million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2021 year-end proved reserves and 2020 year-end proved reserves reflect upward revisions of 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, primarily as a result of improved prices. In addition, extensions and discoveries of approximately 1.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) occurred primarily in the United States (0.9 GOEB), Brazil (0.2 GOEB) and Guyana (0.1 GOEB). Worldwide production in 2021 was 1.4 GOEB.\n\nThe downward revisions in 2020, primarily as a result of low prices during 2020, include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl, 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 GOEB in the United States. In addition, the Corporation's near-term reduction in capital  expenditures  resulted  in  a  net  reduction  to  estimates  of  proved  reserves  of  approximately  1.5  GOEB,  mainly  related  to unconventional drilling in the United States.",

      "answer": "Chevron's stake in Angola LNG contributed to higher upstream-related earnings in 2021, as noted in its income from equity affiliates, which reached $5,657 million, partly driven by improved performance from Angola LNG. Angola LNG operates within Angola, a market where ExxonMobil also maintains a significant upstream presence, with 3.0 million net acres, including 2.9 million offshore, and completed 1.1 net development wells in 2021. While Chevron benefits from Angola LNG's operations through equity earnings, ExxonMobil's exposure is direct through exploration and development activities, indicating different strategic approaches to capitalizing on Angola's energy sector.",

      "answer": "XOM operates in Nigeria, where exploration licenses in deepwater offshore areas are valid for 10 years under PSCs. These licenses can be converted to 20-year Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) upon commercial discovery, with potential extensions subject to Nigeria's Petroleum Industry Act. Chevron (CVX) reported 106 million barrels of reserves in Africa as of December 31, 2021, indicating a significant presence in the region. The 10-year exploration license term in Nigerian deepwater areas constrains Chevron's timeline for making commercial discoveries and transitioning to production, directly influencing its long-term production planning and investment decisions in Africa.",

Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

      "answer": "Chevron's 30% stake in QatarEnergy LNG gives it direct upstream exposure to crude oil production at 13 MBD, reflecting a strategic upstream position in the LNG value chain. In contrast, Exxon's $79 million crude oil and product purchases in 2023 indicate a downstream-focused exposure, where it acquires crude as an input for refining or chemical operations. These figures highlight Chevron's upstream participation in LNG-associated crude production and Exxon's downstream procurement needs, revealing distinct strategic roles in the value chain.",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Downstream\n\nExxonMobil's Downstream continues to be one of the largest, most integrated businesses among international oil companies (IOC), with significant positions across the full value chain including logistics, trading, refining, and marketing. The Corporation has a well-established presence in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific.\n\nDownstream strategies competitively position the business across a range of market conditions. These strategies focus on providing high-value and lower-emission products that customers need to power global mobility; leveraging strong operations performance; capitalizing on integration across all ExxonMobil businesses; maximizing value from advantaged technology and a robust pipeline of  lower-emission  opportunities;  and  improving  portfolio  competitiveness  and  resilience  with  advantaged  investments  and divestments.\n\nWith its large manufacturing footprint, ExxonMobil's Downstream earnings are closely tied to industry refining margins. Refining margins  improved  steadily  throughout  2021,  recovering  from  historic  lows  in  2020  driven  by  COVID-19  pandemic  demand impacts.  By  the  end  of  2021,  refining  margins  had  recovered  to  the  bottom  of  the  10-year  historical  band  from  2010  to  2019. Demand for gasoline and diesel had essentially recovered to normal levels by the end of 2021, while jet fuel demand remained below historical levels reflecting continued COVID-19 restrictions. Refining margins are anticipated to further improve in the near term as the recovery in international travel increases demand for jet fuel, and strong chemical demand persists for products essential to modern life. With improving market conditions, we restarted projects in Beaumont, Texas and Singapore to further strengthen the portfolio by increasing production of high-value fuels and lubricants.\n\nRefining margins are largely driven by differences in commodity prices and are a function of the difference between what a refinery pays for its raw materials and the market prices for the range of products produced. Crude oil and many products are widely traded with published prices, including those quoted on multiple exchanges around the world (e.g. New York Mercantile Exchange and Intercontinental Exchange). Prices for these commodities are determined by the global marketplace and are influenced by many factors,  including  global  and  regional  supply/demand  balances,  inventory  levels,  industry  refinery  operations,  import/export balances, currency fluctuations, seasonal demand, weather, and political climate. ExxonMobil's outlook is that industry refining margins will remain volatile subject to shifting consumer demand as well as capacity changes from refinery additions and closures. ExxonMobil's significant integration both within the Downstream value chains including lubricants, logistics, trading, refining, and marketing,  as  well  as  with  Upstream  and  Chemical,  improves  our  ability  to  generate  shareholder  value  in  a  variety  of  market conditions.\n\nExxonMobil continues to grow fuels product sales in new markets near major production assets with continued progress in the Mexico and Indonesia markets. Similarly, the lubricants business continues to grow, especially in Asia Pacific and the industrial sector, leveraging world class brands and integration with basestocks refining capability. Through the Mobil brands, such as Mobil 1, ExxonMobil is the worldwide leader in synthetic motor oils.\n\nThe  Downstream  business  is  characterized  by  periods  of  margin  volatility  resulting  from  short-term  and  long-term  supply  and demand fluctuations. Proposed carbon policy and other climate-related regulations in many countries have the potential to increase industry volatility, both favorably and unfavorably. ExxonMobil continually evaluates the Downstream portfolio during all phases of the business cycle, which has resulted in numerous asset divestments and terminal conversions over the past decade to strengthen overall profitability and resiliency. When investing in the Downstream, ExxonMobil remains focused on projects resilient across a broad range of market conditions to support capturing value when opportunities emerge.\n\n## Key Recent Events\n\nLower-emission fuels : ExxonMobil announced plans for more than 40 thousand barrels per day of lower-emission fuels by 2025, including a new renewable diesel unit at the Strathcona refinery, and purchase agreements with Global Clean Energy in the U.S. and Biojet AS in Norway.\n\nTerminal conversions : ExxonMobil converted the Slagen, Norway and Altona, Australia refineries into product import terminals capable  of  serving  existing  markets.  Additionally,  Refining  New  Zealand  announced  conversion  of  its  refinery  (in  which ExxonMobil owns a 17% minority share) to a product import terminal in 2022.",

      "question": "Given that Chevron's reserves include a significant portion from production-sharing contracts and ExxonMobil operates in Nigeria under similar agreements, how does the duration of Nigerian PSCs align with Chevron's 10-year exploration period and ExxonMobil's 16+ year tax exposure in the country?",
      "answer": "Chevron's reserves include 8-10% from production-sharing contracts (PSCs) as noted in its filings, which directly ties its reserve composition to contractual frameworks like those in Nigeria. Nigerian PSCs typically span 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period with potential for production term extensions. ExxonMobil's operational presence in Nigeria has led to open tax years dating back to 2006, indicating a minimum 16-year exposure as of 2022. This aligns with the typical 30-year duration of Nigerian PSCs, suggesting that ExxonMobil's operational timeline in the country could span the full life cycle of these agreements.",

          "chunk_text": "Production  rights  granted  prior  to  January  1,  2003,  remain  subject  to  their  existing  terms,  and  differ  slightly  for  onshore  and offshore  areas.  Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

      "answer": "ExxonMobil (XOM) projects that oil will maintain a ~30% share of the global energy mix through 2050, emphasizing its continued importance, especially in hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as aviation and heavy industry. ConocoPhillips (COP) currently holds a net productive oil capacity of 8,536 thousand barrels per day, with major production concentrated in the Lower 48 (6,954 thousand barrels net per day) and international regions like Africa and Asia Pacific/Middle East. This substantial production capacity positions COP to maintain a significant role in supplying oil for critical sectors, aligning with XOM's outlook on oil's enduring relevance. However, COP may also face increasing pressure to integrate lower-emission fuels and carbon management technologies into its operations to meet long-term decarbonization goals.",

      "answer": "Chevron's (CVX) reserves tied to production-sharing contracts (PSCs) accounted for 8% of its consolidated reserves in 2021. ExxonMobil (XOM) operates in Nigeria, where deepwater offshore exploration and production are governed by PSCs with terms typically lasting 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period and a 20-year production period. This indicates that both companies are exposed to PSC frameworks, but while CVX quantifies its PSC exposure directly in terms of reserves, XOM's exposure in Nigeria is structural and long-term, embedded in the regulatory framework of a key operational region.",

Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

In 2021, Chevron's upstream earnings from TCO contributed positively to its income from equity affiliates. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil reported a total long-lived asset value in Kazakhstan of $8,463 million as of 2021.

At December 31, 2021, the company's carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $100 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO's net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO's net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the FGP/WPMP with a balance of $4,500.\n\nPetropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the heavy oil Huyapari Field and upgrading project in Venezuela's Orinoco Belt.

Chevron, which operates in Nigeria and has its last finalized tax audit for the country dating back to 2007, must align its long-term operational and investment planning with the same regulatory framework. The 30-year PSC structure provides a multi-decade planning horizon, but also introduces complexity in tax and investment decisions due to the long duration of exposure and potential regulatory changes, especially given Chevron's unresolved tax positions in Nigeria that remain under audit.",

          "chunk_text": "ExxonMobil's investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions, blocks, and leases. The terms  and  conditions  under  which  the  Corporation  maintains  exploration  and/or  production  rights  to  the  acreage  are  propertyspecific, contractually defined, and vary significantly from property to property. Work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration. In some instances, the Corporation may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension. In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the Corporation has generally been successful in obtaining extensions. The scheduled expiration of leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporation.\n\n## D. Summary of Acreage Terms\n\n## UNITED STATES\n\nOil and gas exploration and production rights are acquired from mineral interest owners through a lease. Mineral interest owners include the Federal and State governments, as well as private mineral interest owners. Leases typically have an exploration period ranging  from  one  to  ten  years,  and  a  production  period  that  normally  remains  in  effect  until  production  ceases.  Under  certain circumstances, a lease may be held beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced. In some instances regarding private property, a 'fee interest' is acquired where the underlying mineral interests are owned outright.\n\n## CANADA / OTHER AMERICAS\n\n## Canada\n\nExploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible. These licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or leases upon completing specified work. In general, these license and lease agreements are held as long as there is proven production capability on the licenses and leases. Exploration licenses in offshore eastern Canada and the Beaufort Sea are held by work commitments of various amounts and rentals. They are valid for a term  of  nine  years.  Offshore  production  licenses  are  valid  for  25  years,  with  rights  of  extension  for  continued  production. Significant discovery licenses in the offshore, relating to currently undeveloped discoveries, do not have a definite term.\n\n## Argentina\n\nThe  Federal  Hydrocarbon  Law  was  amended  in  2014.  Pursuant  to  the  amended  law,  the  production  term  for  an  onshore unconventional concession is 35 years, and 25 years for a conventional concession, with unlimited 10-year extensions possible, once a field has been developed. In 2019, the government granted three offshore exploration licenses, with terms of eight years, divided  into  two  exploration  periods  of  four  years,  with  an  optional  extension  of  five  years  for  each  license.  Two  onshore exploration  concessions  were  initially  granted  prior  to  the  amendment  and  are  governed  under  Provincial  Law  with  expiration terms through 2024.\n\n## Brazil\n\nThe exploration and production of oil and gas are governed by concession contracts and production sharing contracts. Concession contracts  provide  for  an  exploration  period  of  up  to  8  years  and  a  production  period  of  27  years.  Production  sharing  contracts provide for an exploration period of up to 7 years and a production period of up to 28 years.\n\n## Guyana\n\nThe  Petroleum  (Exploration  and  Production)  Act  authorizes  the  government  of  Guyana  to  grant  petroleum  prospecting  and production  licenses  and  to  enter  into  petroleum  agreements  for  the  exploration  and  production  of  hydrocarbons.  Petroleum agreements provide for an exploration period of up to 10 years and a production period of 20 years, with a 10-year extension.\n\n## EUROPE\n\n## Germany\n\nExploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum period of five years, with an unlimited number of extensions up to three years each. Extensions are subject to specific minimum work commitments. Production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple possible extensions subject to production on the license.\n\n## Netherlands\n\nUnder the Mining Law, effective January 1, 2003, exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. The term is based on the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is issued. License conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the Mining Law.",

Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

      "answer": "XOM reported $7,728 million in long-lived assets in Kazakhstan in 2023, reflecting its operational exposure in the region. Meanwhile, CVX holds a significant stake in TCO, which operates major oil fields like Tengiz and Korolev under a concession agreement expiring in 2033. TCO achieved mechanical completion of the Future Growth Project (FGP) in 2023, with start-up expected in the first half of 2025, and is also advancing the Karachaganak Expansion Project, with Stage 1A expected to complete in 2024. CVX\u2019s involvement through TCO demonstrates its strategic positioning in Kazakhstan\u2019s upstream sector, despite not directly owning long-lived assets like XOM.",

        "Hop 1: XOM \u2192 Kazakhstan: XOM has $7,728 million in long-lived assets in Kazakhstan in 2023, indicating its direct operational exposure in the country.",

      "answer": "Chevron U.S.A. Inc. sold its Alaskan upstream assets to ConocoPhillips in 2024 for $296 million, as reported in COP's 10-K filing. This transaction increased COP\u2019s working interest in the Kuparuk River Unit and Prudhoe Bay Unit. Chevron's 2024 10-K shows that Chevron U.S.A. Inc. holds the company's investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC, which is accounted for using the equity method. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC had a carrying value of $8,571 million in CVX's investments as of December 31, 2024. The sale of the Alaskan assets represents a reallocation of Chevron\u2019s upstream portfolio, while maintaining significant downstream chemical investments through its subsidiary Chevron U.S.A. Inc.",

      "question": "How does Chevron's investment in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) influence its crude oil export capacity, and how does this compare to ConocoPhillips' reliance on crude oil production for its upstream operations?",
      "answer": "Chevron's 15% interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) enables it to export approximately 1.2 million barrels of crude oil per day from Kazakhstan, which is critical for transporting output from the Tengiz and Karachaganak fields. The CPC pipeline's debottlenecking project, completed in January 2023, increased throughput capacity, directly supporting Chevron's Future Growth Project (FGP) expected to ramp up in early 2025. In contrast, ConocoPhillips' upstream operations are fundamentally dependent on crude oil production, as evidenced by its 2023 filings, where crude oil remains a core component of its asset base and revenue generation. Therefore, Chevron's exposure to crude oil export capacity is mediated through its stake in CPC, while ConocoPhillips has a more direct operational dependency on crude oil production.",

        "Hop 1: CVX \u2192 CPC: Chevron holds a 15% interest in the CPC, which transports 1.2 million barrels of crude oil per day from Kazakhstan, including production from Chevron-operated fields.",
        "Hop 2: CPC \u2192 Crude Oil: The CPC pipeline serves as a critical transportation route for Kazakh (and Russian) crude oil, with Chevron's FGP relying on the pipeline's increased throughput post-debottlenecking in January 2023.",
        "Hop 3: Crude Oil \u2190 COP: ConocoPhillips' upstream operations are directly dependent on crude oil production, as stated in its 2023 10-K filing, indicating a core operational link to crude oil as a raw material."

COP includes the Gulf of Mexico within its Lower 48 segment, which contributed 64% of consolidated liquids production and 76% of natural gas production in 2023. This segment also accounted for $5,729 million in depreciation, depletion, amortization, and impairments, reflecting substantial asset utilization.

      "question": "How does Chevron's 15% ownership stake in TCO's Kazakhstan crude oil operations influence its exposure to TCO's planned production ramp-up from the FGP project starting in 2025, especially when compared to COP's broader dependence on crude oil as a raw material?",
      "answer": "Chevron's 15% ownership in TCO provides it with partial exposure to TCO's planned production ramp-up from the FGP project in Kazakhstan, which is expected to start-up in the first half of 2025 and ramp up to full production within three months. This production increase will flow through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), in which Chevron also holds a 15% interest, enabling increased throughput capacity. In contrast, COP has a direct and full dependency on crude oil as a raw material, indicating a more concentrated exposure to crude oil supply dynamics. Chevron\u2019s partial ownership in TCO creates a more indirect exposure to crude oil production volumes and timelines in Kazakhstan, as opposed to COP\u2019s direct reliance on crude oil for its operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP \u2192 Crude Oil: COP depends on crude oil as a raw material, indicating a direct and full dependency on crude oil supply chains.",
        "Hop 2: Crude Oil \u2192 TCO: TCO is actively producing crude oil in Kazakhstan, with the FGP project expected to start-up in early 2025 and ramp to full production within three months, relying on the CPC pipeline for exports.",
        "Hop 3: TCO \u2190 CVX: Chevron holds a 15% interest in TCO and also owns a 15% stake in the CPC pipeline, giving it partial exposure to TCO\u2019s production and transportation infrastructure in Kazakhstan."

      "question": "How does the expiration timeline of exploration rights in Mozambique, as detailed in XOM's 2022 filing, align with CVX's reserve reporting for similar offshore projects, and what does this suggest about their respective development strategies in light of the 30-year regulatory expiration window?",
      "answer": "XOM's 2022 filing shows that its interest in offshore blocks A5-B, Z5-C, and Z5-D in Mozambique is governed by Exploration and Production Concession Contracts (EPCCs), with initial exploration phases expiring in 2022 (blocks Z5-C and Z5-D) and 2023 (block A5-B after a one-year extension). The EPCCs allow for a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development. CVX's 2022 10-K filing reports reserves in Africa at 106 million barrels as of December 31, 2021, with changes in reserves tied to revisions, discoveries, and production activities. Given that CVX maintains stable reserves in Africa despite the looming expiration timelines, this suggests that CVX may be aligning its development plans with the 30-year regulatory window by accelerating appraisal or sanctioning projects before exploration rights lapse, particularly in similar offshore environments like those operated by XOM.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: XOM \u2192 Mozambique: XOM holds offshore exploration rights in Mozambique under EPCCs, with expiration dates in 2022 and 2023 unless extended through development approval.",
        "Hop 2: Mozambique \u2192 Exploration and Production Activities: Mozambique's regulatory framework allows for a 30-year development and production period after approval of a plan of development, which is critical for long-term project viability.",
        "Hop 3: Exploration and Production Activities \u2190 CVX: CVX reported 106 million barrels of reserves in Africa as of December 31, 2021, with active management of reserves through revisions, discoveries, and production, indicating ongoing development aligned with long-term regulatory timelines."

          "chunk_text": "Production  rights  granted  prior  to  January  1,  2003,  remain  subject  to  their  existing  terms,  and  differ  slightly  for  onshore  and offshore  areas.  Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

      "answer": "Chevron faces unresolved tax audits in Nigeria with $5,288 million in unrecognized tax benefits at year-end 2021, where the latest audit finalized was for the year 2007, leaving over a decade of tax exposure open to scrutiny. Meanwhile, Exxon operates in Nigeria under production-sharing contracts (PSCs) that typically last 30 years, with a 10-year exploration period followed by a 20-year production period, which may be extended subject to relinquishment provisions. Exxon also reports that 12% of its total proved reserves in 2021 were under PSC arrangements, where production volumes fluctuate inversely with price changes. Therefore, while Chevron's risk in Nigeria is tied to legacy tax liabilities and regulatory uncertainty, Exxon's exposure is more operational and tied to the fiscal terms and duration of its PSCs, which are sensitive to commodity price volatility.",

For the company's major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31, 2021.

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and  under  existing  economic  conditions,  operating  methods  and  government  regulations  -  prior  to  the  time  at  which  contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month  price  for  each  month  within  such  period.  These  reserves  quantities  are  also  used  in  calculating  unit-ofproduction depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the  evaluation  or  re-evaluation  of  (1)  already  available  geologic,  reservoir  or  production  data,  (2)  new  geologic,  reservoir  or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of  reserves.  Revisions  can  also  result  from  significant  changes  in  either  development  strategy  or  production  equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved  reserves  include  100  percent  of  each  majority-owned  affiliate's  participation  in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's ownership percentage  of  the  proved  reserves  of  equity  companies,  but  exclude  royalties  and  quantities  due  others.  Natural  gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2021 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 12 percent  on  an  oil-equivalent  basis  (natural  gas  is  converted  to  an  oil-equivalent  basis  at  six  billion  cubic  feet  per  one  million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2021 year-end proved reserves and 2020 year-end proved reserves reflect upward revisions of 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, primarily as a result of improved prices. In addition, extensions and discoveries of approximately 1.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) occurred primarily in the United States (0.9 GOEB), Brazil (0.2 GOEB) and Guyana (0.1 GOEB). Worldwide production in 2021 was 1.4 GOEB.\n\nThe downward revisions in 2020, primarily as a result of low prices during 2020, include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl, 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 GOEB in the United States. In addition, the Corporation's near-term reduction in capital  expenditures  resulted  in  a  net  reduction  to  estimates  of  proved  reserves  of  approximately  1.5  GOEB,  mainly  related  to unconventional drilling in the United States.",

      "answer": "Nigeria's regulatory framework for deepwater offshore exploration establishes 30-year production-sharing contracts (PSCs) that include a 10-year exploration period followed by a 20-year production period, which may be extended under certain conditions. Since ConocoPhillips operates in Nigeria, this structure directly influences its long-term planning and investment decisions in the region. Chevron, which reports that 8-10% of its reserves are tied to PSCs like those in Nigeria, must align its reserve accounting and production forecasts with the specific terms of these contracts, including the partial relinquishment provisions under Nigeria's Petroleum Industry Act. Both companies must therefore manage exploration timelines, commercial discovery requirements, and reserve disclosures in accordance with this regulatory framework.",

      "answer": "Nigeria's regulatory framework establishes 30-year production sharing contracts (PSCs) with a 10-year exploration period followed by a 20-year production period, requiring partial relinquishment at the end of exploration (from hop2_evidence). ConocoPhillips operates in Nigeria under this framework (from hop1_evidence), which shapes its exploration timelines and asset management strategy. Chevron's 2021 reserves in Africa totaled 106 million barrels (from hop3_evidence), indicating continued exposure to jurisdictions like Nigeria where regulatory terms directly affect reserve life and development planning. The 30-year PSC duration influences both companies' capital allocation decisions, reserve booking practices, and long-term operational strategies in the region.",

          "chunk_text": "Production  rights  granted  prior  to  January  1,  2003,  remain  subject  to  their  existing  terms,  and  differ  slightly  for  onshore  and offshore  areas.  Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips produced 8,536 million barrels of oil gross in 2023, indicating a significant current contribution to global oil supply. ExxonMobil projects that oil will maintain a 30% share of the global energy mix by 2050, suggesting continued strategic importance of oil in the energy landscape. This alignment implies both companies are likely to sustain or optimize oil production in the long term, despite broader energy transition trends.",

      "answer": "If South American emission standards align with stricter U.S. methane regulations, Chevron would face increased capital and operating expenditures to comply with these requirements, as noted in their 2023 filing regarding anticipated costs from EPA methane rules. This could delay project approvals or reduce investment capacity. For ExxonMobil, which reported 342 net thousands of acres under development in South America in 2023, stricter standards might extend permitting timelines or increase operational costs. The F_10k_2023 filing indicates that countries in South America are evolving toward more stringent requirements aligned with U.S. or European standards, with Brazil following its own PROCONVE process, which already incorporates elements of U.S. regulations for light-duty vehicles. This regulatory shift could create a dual impact: Chevron's compliance costs may limit regional investment flexibility, while Exxon\u2019s acreage development timelines might be extended due to enhanced environmental permitting requirements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP \u2192 Emission Standards: Chevron\u2019s 2023 filing highlights substantial anticipated capital and operating expenditures due to methane emission regulations, such as those issued by the EPA in December 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Emission Standards \u2192 South America: The F_10k_2023 filing states that most South American countries are adopting more stringent emission requirements aligned with U.S. or European standards, with Brazil operating under the PROCONVE framework that incorporates elements of U.S. regulations.",
        "Hop 3: South America \u2190 XOM: ExxonMobil reported 342 net thousands of acres under development in South America in 2023, indicating active upstream investment that could be affected by evolving regulatory requirements."

These models are also validated through procedures that test the completeness and accuracy of the data used. In contrast, CVX relies on internal discounted cash flow models for Level 2 derivatives that incorporate observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, and foreign currency exchange rates, and also obtains multiple pricing sources for these instruments. Both companies emphasize the importance of observable data and internal validation, but XOM involves external specialists and applies more rigorous data testing procedures compared to CVX, which relies more heavily on third-party pricing information.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe fair value of Level 2 investments are primarily determined based on an internal valuation model that uses observable inputs such as stock trading price, volatility and risk free rate.\n\nThe fair values of Level 2 derivatives are primarily determined by internal discounted cash flow models that use observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves and foreign currency exchange rates. Counterparty credit risk, which is mitigated by master netting agreements and collateral posting arrangements with certain counterparties, had an impact on derivative fair value estimates that was not material. The Company's derivative financial instruments are discussed in Note 17.\n\nLevel 2 other liabilities are primarily arrangements that are valued based on the fair value of underlying investments, which are generally measured using Level 1 and Level 2 fair value techniques.\n\nLevel 2 borrowings, which include commercial paper, U.S. dollar denominated notes and certain foreign currency denominated borrowings, are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or identical instruments in markets that are not active.\n\nLevel 3 borrowings include the Asia Theme Park borrowings, which are valued based on the current borrowing cost and credit risk of the Asia Theme Parks as well as prevailing market interest rates.\n\nThe Company's financial instruments also include cash, cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate the fair values.\n\n## Non-recurring Fair Value Measure\n\nThe Company also has assets that may be required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are evaluated when certain triggering events occur (including a decrease in estimated future cash flows) that indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges as disclosed in Notes 4 and 18. Fair value was determined using estimated discounted future cash flows, which is a Level 3 valuation technique (see Note 2 for a discussion of the more significant inputs used in our discounted cash flow analysis).\n\n## Credit Concentrations\n\nThe Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments on an ongoing basis and does not currently anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\n\nThe Company does not expect that it would realize a material loss, based on the fair value of its derivative financial instruments as of September 28, 2024, in the event of nonperformance by any single derivative counterparty. The Company generally enters into derivative transactions only with counterparties that have a credit rating of A- or better and requires collateral in the event credit ratings fall below A- or aggregate ex posures ex ceed limits as defined by contract. In addition, the Company limits the amount of investment credit exposure with any one institution.\n\nThe Company does not have material cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that have below investment grade credit ratings and maintains short-term liquidity balances in high quality money market funds. At September 28, 2024, the Company's balances (excluding money market funds) with individual financial institutions that ex ceeded 10% of the Company's total cash and cash equivalents were 24% of total cash and cash equivalents.

The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2024.\n\nDerivatives The company records most of its derivative instruments - other than any commodity derivative contracts that are accounted for as normal purchase and normal sale - on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. The company designates certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, if applicable. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts valued using quoted prices from active markets such as the New Y ork Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level  2  instruments.  Since  this  pricing  information  is  generated  from  observable  market  data,  it  has  historically  been  very  consistent.  The  company  does  not materially adjust this information.\n\nProperties,  Plant  and  Equipment In  2024,  the  company  did  not  have  any  individually  material  impairments  of  long  lived  assets  measured  at  fair  value  on  a nonrecurring basis.

Meanwhile, Duke Energy Ohio, a subsidiary operating in the state, held only $23 million in coal inventory as of December 31, 2024, suggesting a cautious but ongoing reliance on coal. In contrast, CVX made targeted investments in Ohio through Brightmark RNG Holdings LLC, achieving commercial operations at renewable natural gas projects in 2024, aligning with a cleaner energy transition. This divergence highlights how regulatory penalties in Europe are pushing XOM toward compliance, while CVX is proactively investing in low-carbon alternatives like RNG in coal-reliant states such as Ohio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: XOM \u2192 Coal: XOM incurred a $1.8 billion tax charge in 2022 due to the EU's emergency coal tax targeting surplus profits, indicating regulatory pressure to move away from coal.",
        "Hop 2: Coal \u2192 Ohio: Duke Energy Ohio held $23 million in coal inventory as of December 31, 2024, showing the state still has some coal dependency, albeit reduced.",
        "Hop 3: Ohio \u2190 CVX: CVX advanced renewable natural gas (RNG) projects in Ohio in 2024 through Brightmark RNG Holdings LLC, reflecting a proactive energy transition strategy in a state with residual coal use."

On October 6, 2022, European Union ('EU') Member States adopted an EU Council Regulation which, along with other measures, introduced a new tax described as an emergency intervention to address high energy prices. This regulation imposed a mandatory tax on certain companies active in the crude petroleum, coal, natural gas, and refinery sectors. The regulation required EU Member States to levy a minimum 33 percent tax on inscope companies' 2022 and/or 2023 'surplus profits\", defined in the regulation as taxable profits exceeding 120 percent of the annual average profits during the 20182021 period. EU Member States were required to implement the tax, or an equivalent national measure, by December 31, 2022. The enactment of these regulations by EU Member States resulted in an after-tax charge of approximately $1.8 billion to the Corporation's fourth-quarter 2022 results and approximately $0.2 billion in 2023, mainly reflected in the line 'Income tax  ex pense (benefit)' on the Consolidated Statement of Income.",

      "answer": "Chevron has financed Tengizchevroil's (TCO) expansion projects, including a $4,500 million loan for the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and Future Growth Project (FGP), which increased TCO's crude oil production capacity by 260,000 barrels per day. These volumes are largely exported through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), in which Chevron holds a 15% stake. The CPC also transports crude oil from other fields, including Karachaganak, where Chevron has an 18% nonoperated interest. ConocoPhillips (COP) reported $6.7 billion in sales to a certain pipeline company in 2024, which could reflect crude oil transported via shared infrastructure like the CPC. Therefore, Chevron's upstream investment and production growth in Kazakhstan may influence COP\u2019s revenue realization through shared pipeline networks, particularly if pipeline capacity or tariffs are impacted by increased throughput from Chevron\u2019s projects.",

With the acquisition, we have increased our global operations adding oil, natural gas and LNG activity in Equatorial Guinea to our portfolio. See Note 3.\n\nWe have varying stages of oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in Equatorial Guinea. We operate in both the Alba and Block D PSCs that form the Alba Unit located offshore Equatorial Guinea.\n\n## Gas Processing\n\nThe following facilities located on Bioko Island allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the Alba Unit and are accounted for as equity method i nvestments and are reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement.\n\nWe own a 52.2 percent interest in the Alba Plant LLC, our joint venture with Chevron Corporation (27.8 percent) and Sociedad Nacional de Gas de Guinea Ecuatorial (SONAGAS) (20.0 percent), which operates an onshore liquified petroleum gas (LPG) processing plant. Alba Plant LLC processes Alba Unit natural gas under a fixed-rate long-term contract. The LPG processing plant extracts condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and sells it at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement. Processed natural gas is delivered to Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited (EG LNG) for liquefaction and storage. We market our share of LNG to third parties indexed at global LNG prices.\n\nWe own a 56.0 percent interest in EG LNG, our joint venture with SONAGAS (37.9 percent) and Marubeni Gas Development UK Limited (6.1 percent), which operates a 3.7 MTPA LNG production facility. In January 2024, we began a five-year LNG sales agreement for a portion of our equity gas from the Alba Unit, providing us with additional exposure to the European LNG market.\n\nWe own a 45.0 percent interest in Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (AMPCO), our joint venture with Chevron Corporation (45.0 percent) and SONAGAS (10.0 percent), which operates a methanol plant. The plant is currently offline.\n\nAdditionally, Alba Plant LLC and EG LNG process third-party gas from the Alen Field under a combination of tolling fee and profit-sharing arrangements which are reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement.",

          "chunk_text": "At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $283 million of certain variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs) outstanding with maturities ranging through 2035. The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

      "answer": "COP's acquisition of an additional 5% working interest in the Kuparuk River Unit from Chevron U.S.A. Inc. enhances its crude oil exposure in one of North America\u2019s largest oil-producing regions. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., which manages most of CVX\u2019s U.S. crude oil operations including exploration, production, and refining, continues to operate within the same asset base that COP has expanded into. CVX's 2024 operations remain anchored in these same crude oil assets through its subsidiary structure, meaning both companies are leveraging production from overlapping geographic regions, albeit with differing ownership stakes and operational responsibilities.",

        "Hop 1: COP \u2192 Chevron U.S.A. Inc.: COP acquired an additional 5% working interest in the Kuparuk River Unit from Chevron U.S.A. Inc. in Q4 2024, increasing its exposure to North America\u2019s largest conventional oil fields.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips has a maximum potential future payment of $116 million tied to its guarantee obligations for Alba Plant LLC, which operates an LPG processing plant in Equatorial Guinea. Meanwhile, Chevron, as a 27.8% partner in Alba Plant LLC, reported condensate production of 598 million barrels in 2024, which is processed from natural gas streams in their operations. These figures represent two distinct aspects of risk exposure: COP's liability is financial and capped at $116 million, while CVX's exposure is operational and tied to production volumes.",

          "chunk_text": "At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $283 million of certain variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs) outstanding with maturities ranging through 2035. The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

With the acquisition, we have increased our global operations adding oil, natural gas and LNG activity in Equatorial Guinea to our portfolio. See Note 3.\n\nWe have varying stages of oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in Equatorial Guinea. We operate in both the Alba and Block D PSCs that form the Alba Unit located offshore Equatorial Guinea.\n\n## Gas Processing\n\nThe following facilities located on Bioko Island allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the Alba Unit and are accounted for as equity method i nvestments and are reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement.\n\nWe own a 52.2 percent interest in the Alba Plant LLC, our joint venture with Chevron Corporation (27.8 percent) and Sociedad Nacional de Gas de Guinea Ecuatorial (SONAGAS) (20.0 percent), which operates an onshore liquified petroleum gas (LPG) processing plant. Alba Plant LLC processes Alba Unit natural gas under a fixed-rate long-term contract. The LPG processing plant extracts condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and sells it at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement. Processed natural gas is delivered to Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited (EG LNG) for liquefaction and storage. We market our share of LNG to third parties indexed at global LNG prices.\n\nWe own a 56.0 percent interest in EG LNG, our joint venture with SONAGAS (37.9 percent) and Marubeni Gas Development UK Limited (6.1 percent), which operates a 3.7 MTPA LNG production facility. In January 2024, we began a five-year LNG sales agreement for a portion of our equity gas from the Alba Unit, providing us with additional exposure to the European LNG market.\n\nWe own a 45.0 percent interest in Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (AMPCO), our joint venture with Chevron Corporation (45.0 percent) and SONAGAS (10.0 percent), which operates a methanol plant. The plant is currently offline.\n\nAdditionally, Alba Plant LLC and EG LNG process third-party gas from the Alen Field under a combination of tolling fee and profit-sharing arrangements which are reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement.",

      "answer": "COP's acquisition of additional working interest in the Kuparuk River Unit from Chevron U.S.A. Inc. enhances its exposure to natural gas liquids (NGLs) production in the Greater Kuparuk Area, where Chevron U.S.A. Inc. produces NGLs as part of its upstream operations. This acquisition increases COP's operational footprint in an area that includes infrastructure for separating oil, natural gas, and water, which supports NGL extraction. Meanwhile, XOM also produces NGLs, as noted in its 10-K filing that includes Crude Oil, Natural Gas Liquids, Bitumen, and Synthetic Oil Proved Reserves. While exact production volumes aren't provided for either company, the transaction positions COP to leverage Chevron U.S.A. Inc.'s existing NGL production infrastructure, potentially aligning its NGL output profile closer to XOM's scale of NGL activities in the broader upstream context.",

See Note 3.\n\nAfter exercising our preferential rights, we completed our acquisition of additional working interest in the Kuparuk River Unit and Prudhoe Bay Unit from Chevron U.S.A. Inc and Union Oil Company of California in the fourth quarter of 2024. This transaction increased our working interest by approximately five percent in the Kuparuk River Unit and approximately 0.4 percent in the Prudhoe Bay Unit. See Note 3.\n\n## Greater Prudhoe Area\n\nThe Greater Prudhoe Area includes the Prudhoe Bay Unit, which consists of the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest conventional oil field in North America, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, supported by a large gas and water processing operation. Field installations include seven production facilities, two gas plants, two seawater plants and a central power station. In 2024, on average, there were two rigs drilling throughout the year.\n\n## Greater Kuparuk Area\n\nThe Greater Kuparuk Area includes the Kuparuk River Unit, which consists of the Kuparuk Field and six satellite fields. Field installations include three central production facilities which separate oil, natural gas and water, and a seawater treatment plant. In 2024, we operated two drilling rigs and two workover rigs. The Nuna project, which targets the Moraine reservoir, was sanctioned in 2023 and achieved first oil in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Coyote reservoir discovered in 2021 progressed to development in 2023 with additional wells drilled in 2024 and planned for 2025.",

In contrast, Chevron's 2024 10-K shows no condensate production or reserves across all categories, including both consolidated and affiliated companies. This indicates that while COP has exposure to condensate through its Alba Plant investment, Chevron had no direct condensate production in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $283 million of certain variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs) outstanding with maturities ranging through 2035. The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the 'Long-term debt' line on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Note 9-Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at i nception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\n\n## APLNG Guarantees\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2024 exchange rates:\n\n- During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be six years. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n- In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $610 million ($1.0 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.\n- We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 12 to 21 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $480 million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $34 million.\n\n## QatarEnergy LNG Limited Guarantee\n\nWe have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. This guarantee has an approximate 30year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14 million.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea Guarantees\n\nWe have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas. These guarantees have three years remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $116 million. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $4 million.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n100",

The LPG processing plant extracts condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and sells it at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement. Processed natural gas is delivered to Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited (EG LNG) for liquefaction and storage. We market our share of LNG to third parties indexed at global LNG prices.\n\nWe own a 56.0 percent interest in EG LNG, our joint venture with SONAGAS (37.9 percent) and Marubeni Gas Development UK Limited (6.1 percent), which operates a 3.7 MTPA LNG production facility. In January 2024, we began a five-year LNG sales agreement for a portion of our equity gas from the Alba Unit, providing us with additional exposure to the European LNG market.\n\nWe own a 45.0 percent interest in Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (AMPCO), our joint venture with Chevron Corporation (45.0 percent) and SONAGAS (10.0 percent), which operates a methanol plant. The plant is currently offline.\n\nAdditionally, Alba Plant LLC and EG LNG process third-party gas from the Alen Field under a combination of tolling fee and profit-sharing arrangements which are reflected in the \"Equity in earnings of affiliates\" line of our consolidated income statement.",

      "question": "Given COP's acquisition of additional upstream working interests from Chevron U.S.A. Inc in Alaska in Q4 2024, and Chevron Corporation's continued investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (with a $8,571 million equity investment reported as of 2024), how might these transactions reflect on Chevron's strategic capital allocation between upstream divestitures and downstream chemical operations?",
      "answer": "COP's acquisition of additional upstream working interests in the Kuparuk River Unit and Prudhoe Bay Unit from Chevron U.S.A. Inc in Q4 2024 suggests that Chevron may be selectively divesting certain upstream assets. Chevron U.S.A. Inc holds Chevron Corporation's investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC, a downstream chemicals joint venture where Chevron Corporation reported an $8,571 million equity investment as of 2024. This pattern indicates a potential strategic reallocation of capital from upstream oil production toward downstream chemical operations, though the evidence does not explicitly state Chevron's strategic intent. The timing of the upstream divestiture and the significant downstream investment could suggest a shift in focus, but other uses for the proceeds from the divestiture are also possible.",

See Note 3.\n\nAfter exercising our preferential rights, we completed our acquisition of additional working interest in the Kuparuk River Unit and Prudhoe Bay Unit from Chevron U.S.A. Inc and Union Oil Company of California in the fourth quarter of 2024. This transaction increased our working interest by approximately five percent in the Kuparuk River Unit and approximately 0.4 percent in the Prudhoe Bay Unit. See Note 3.\n\n## Greater Prudhoe Area\n\nThe Greater Prudhoe Area includes the Prudhoe Bay Unit, which consists of the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest conventional oil field in North America, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, supported by a large gas and water processing operation. Field installations include seven production facilities, two gas plants, two seawater plants and a central power station. In 2024, on average, there were two rigs drilling throughout the year.\n\n## Greater Kuparuk Area\n\nThe Greater Kuparuk Area includes the Kuparuk River Unit, which consists of the Kuparuk Field and six satellite fields. Field installations include three central production facilities which separate oil, natural gas and water, and a seawater treatment plant. In 2024, we operated two drilling rigs and two workover rigs. The Nuna project, which targets the Moraine reservoir, was sanctioned in 2023 and achieved first oil in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Coyote reservoir discovered in 2021 progressed to development in 2023 with additional wells drilled in 2024 and planned for 2025.",

      "question": "How do Chevron's (CVX) and ExxonMobil's (XOM) operational timelines and reserve commitments in Nigeria compare under the country's 30-year production sharing contract framework?",
      "answer": "Chevron (CVX) reported 104 million barrels of reserves in Africa as of December 31, 2020, with Nigeria being a key contributor under production sharing contracts (PSCs). These PSCs in Nigeria typically span 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period with partial relinquishment required at its end, followed by a 20-year production period that may be extended. ExxonMobil (XOM) has operated in Nigeria since at least 2006, as indicated by open tax years starting from 2006, suggesting a long-standing operational presence in the country under the same regulatory framework.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVX \u2192 Exploration and Production Activities: Chevron disclosed 104 million barrels of African reserves as of December 31, 2020, with Nigeria being a key region for exploration and production activities.",
        "Hop 2: Exploration and Production Activities \u2192 Nigeria: Nigeria regulates exploration and production activities through 30-year production sharing contracts, which include a 10-year exploration period followed by a 20-year production period, with potential extensions.",

          "chunk_text": "Production  rights  granted  prior  to  January  1,  2003,  remain  subject  to  their  existing  terms,  and  differ  slightly  for  onshore  and offshore  areas.  Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",

The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2024.\n\nDerivatives The company records most of its derivative instruments - other than any commodity derivative contracts that are accounted for as normal purchase and normal sale - on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. The company designates certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, if applicable. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts valued using quoted prices from active markets such as the New Y ork Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level  2  instruments.  Since  this  pricing  information  is  generated  from  observable  market  data,  it  has  historically  been  very  consistent.  The  company  does  not materially adjust this information.\n\nProperties,  Plant  and  Equipment In  2024,  the  company  did  not  have  any  individually  material  impairments  of  long  lived  assets  measured  at  fair  value  on  a nonrecurring basis. In 2023, the company impaired a portion of its U.S. upstream assets, primarily in California, due to continuing regulatory challenges in the state that have resulted in lower anticipated future investment levels in its business plans.\n\nInvestments and Advances The company did not have any material impairments of investments and advances measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in 2024 or 2023.\n\nThe tables below show the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\n\n",

Counterparty credit risk, which is mitigated by master netting agreements and collateral posting arrangements with certain counterparties, had an impact on derivative fair value estimates that was not material. The Company's derivative financial instruments are discussed in Note 17.\n\nLevel 2 other liabilities are primarily arrangements that are valued based on the fair value of underlying investments, which are generally measured using Level 1 and Level 2 fair value techniques.\n\nLevel 2 borrowings, which include commercial paper, U.S. dollar denominated notes and certain foreign currency denominated borrowings, are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or identical instruments in markets that are not active.\n\nLevel 3 borrowings include the Asia Theme Park borrowings, which are valued based on the current borrowing cost and credit risk of the Asia Theme Parks as well as prevailing market interest rates.\n\nThe Company's financial instruments also include cash, cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate the fair values.\n\n## Non-recurring Fair Value Measure\n\nThe Company also has assets that may be required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are evaluated when certain triggering events occur (including a decrease in estimated future cash flows) that indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges as disclosed in Notes 4 and 18. Fair value was determined using estimated discounted future cash flows, which is a Level 3 valuation technique (see Note 2 for a discussion of the more significant inputs used in our discounted cash flow analysis).\n\n## Credit Concentrations\n\nThe Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments on an ongoing basis and does not currently anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\n\nThe Company does not expect that it would realize a material loss, based on the fair value of its derivative financial instruments as of September 28, 2024, in the event of nonperformance by any single derivative counterparty. The Company generally enters into derivative transactions only with counterparties that have a credit rating of A- or better and requires collateral in the event credit ratings fall below A- or aggregate ex posures ex ceed limits as defined by contract. In addition, the Company limits the amount of investment credit exposure with any one institution.\n\nThe Company does not have material cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that have below investment grade credit ratings and maintains short-term liquidity balances in high quality money market funds. At September 28, 2024, the Company's balances (excluding money market funds) with individual financial institutions that ex ceeded 10% of the Company's total cash and cash equivalents were 24% of total cash and cash equivalents.

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Unit-of-Production Depreciation\n\nOil and natural gas reserve volumes are used as the basis to calculate unit-of-production depreciation rates for most upstream assets. Acquisition costs of proved properties are depreciated using a ratio of asset cost to total proved reserves while capitalized drilling and developments costs are depreciated using a ratio of actual production volumes to proved developed reserves. The volumes produced and asset cost are known, while proved reserves are based on estimates that are subject to some variability.\n\nIn the event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.\n\nTo the extent that proved reserves for a property are substantially de-booked and that property continues to produce such that the resulting depreciation charge does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the ex pected life, assets will be depreciated using a unit-of-production method based on reserves determined at the most recent SEC price which results in a more meaningful quantity of proved reserves, appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes.\n\n## Fair Value Used in Business Combinations\n\nIn accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on their respective estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. If applicable, any ex cess of the purchase price over the fair value is recorded as goodwill. The assessment of fair value is based upon the views of a likely market participant group.\n\nOn May 3, 2024, the Corporation acquired Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer), an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. To effect the acquisition, we issued 545 million shares of Ex x onMobil common stock having a fair value of $63 billion on the acquisition date, and assumed debt with a fair value of $5 billion.\n\nIn respect of the Pioneer acquisition, the most significant amount of judgment involved the estimated fair values of property, plant and equipment related to crude oil and natural gas properties, for which we used discounted cash flow models. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future production volumes, commodity prices consistent with the average of third-party industry experts, drilling and development costs, and risk-adjusted discount rates.\n\nThe assumptions and inputs incorporated within the fair value estimates are subject to considerable management judgement and are based on industry, market, and economic conditions prevalent at the time of the acquisition. Actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value.\n\nSee Note 21 for further information regarding the Pioneer acquisition during 2024.\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe Corporation tests assets or groups of assets for recoverability on an ongoing basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Corporation has a robust process to monitor for indicators of potential impairment across its asset groups throughout the year. This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 and ASC 932, and relies, in part, on the Corporation's planning and budgeting cycle.\n\nBecause the lifespans of the vast majority of the Corporation's major assets are measured in decades, the future cash flows of these assets are predominantly based on long-term oil and natural gas commodity prices and industry margins, development costs, and production costs. Significant reductions in the Corporation's view of oil or natural gas commodity prices or margin ranges, especially the longer-term prices and margins, and changes in the development plans, including decisions to defer, reduce, or eliminate planned capital spending, can be an indicator of potential impairment. Other events or changes in circumstances, including indicators outlined in ASC 360, can be indicators of potential impairment as well.\n\nIn general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management believes that prices over the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to generate production from new discoveries, field developments, and technology and efficiency advancements. OPEC+ investment activities and production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of general economic activities, alternative energy sources, and levels of prosperity. During the lifespan of its major assets, the Corporation ex pects that oil and gas prices and industry margins will ex perience significant volatility. Consequently, these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses.

          "chunk_text": "Production  rights  granted  prior  to  January  1,  2003,  remain  subject  to  their  existing  terms,  and  differ  slightly  for  onshore  and offshore  areas.  Onshore  production  licenses  issued  prior  to  1988  were  indefinite;  from  1988  they  were  issued  for  a  period  as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis  until  they  become  producing  areas;  or  licenses  terminate  in  all  other  areas.  The  majority  of  traditional  licenses  currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## AFRICA\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  either  production  sharing  agreements  or  other  contracts  with  initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.\n\n## Chad\n\nExploration permits are issued for a period of five years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.\n\n## Equatorial Guinea\n\nExploration, development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the State Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. The production period for crude oil is 30 years.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy. An  interest  in Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\nIn  2018,  an  interest  was  acquired  in  offshore  blocks, A5-B,  Z5-C  and  Z5-D.  Terms  for  the  three  blocks  are  governed  by  their respective EPCCs, with blocks Z5-C and Z5-D having an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 and block A5-B's initial exploration phase expiring in 2023 after being granted a one-year extension. The EPCCs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years, including a 10-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment is required under the PSC at the end of the  10-year  exploration  period,  and  OMLs  have  a  20-year  production  period  that  may  be  extended,  subject  to  the  partial relinquishment provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) enacted on August 16, 2021.\n\nSome exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in  deepwater  offshore  areas  are  valid  for  10  years,  while  in  all  other  areas  the  licenses  are  for  five  years.  Demonstrating  a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an OPL to an OML.",
