      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each address the impact of weather variability on electricity generation, sales, and cost management, and what does this reveal about their respective risk mitigation strategies?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) manages electricity price risk through long-term power purchase or sales contracts and natural gas supply agreements, aiming to reduce cost volatility for customers through hedging programs. NextEra Energy (NEE) highlights that weather directly affects electricity demand and generation, particularly for wind and solar facilities, where variability in resource availability significantly impacts revenue. Southern Company (SO) notes that weather-adjusted KWH sales increased across residential and commercial sectors in 2023, indicating resilience in demand despite weather deviations. Together, these perspectives show that while all three utilities are exposed to weather-related risks, DUK focuses on cost hedging, NEE emphasizes generation variability and infrastructure threats, and SO highlights demand stability and customer growth.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) classifies most of its foreign currency derivatives as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, using observable inputs such as forward foreign currency rate curves and counterparty credit quality to estimate fair value. NextEra Energy (NEE) applies an income approach based on discounted cash flows with observable inputs to estimate the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and recognizes changes in fair value directly in interest expense. Southern Company (SO) includes foreign currency derivatives among other derivatives in its balance sheet under 'Risk Management Activities' or 'Other,' indicating a consolidated approach to fair value disclosure without specific breakdowns.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nFair value is the exchange price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between m arket participants at the m easurem ent date. T he fair value definition focuses on an exit price versus the acquisition cost. F air value m easurem ents use m arket data or assum ptions m arket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assum ptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. T hese inputs m ay be readily observable, corroborated by m arket data, or generally unobservable. Valuation techniques m axim ize the use of observable inputs and m inim ize the use of unobservable inputs. A m idm arket pricing convention (the m idpoint price between bid and ask prices) is perm itted for use as a practical expedient.\n\nFair value m easurem ents are classified in three levels based on the fair value hierarchy as defined by G AAP . C ertain investm ents are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy. These investm ents are m easured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. T he net asset value is derived based on the investm ent cost, less any im pairm ent, plus or m inus changes resulting from  observable price changes for an identical or sim ilar investm ent of the sam e issuer.\n\nFair value accounting guidance perm its entities to elect to m easure certain financial instrum ents that are not required to be accounted for at fair value, such as equity m ethod investm ents or the C om pany's own debt, at fair value. T he D uke E nergy R egistrants have not elected to record any of these item s at fair value.\n\nValuation m ethods of the prim ary fair value m easurem ents disclosed below are as follows.\n\n## Investments in equity securities\n\nThe m ajority of investm ents in equity securities are valued using Level 1 m easurem ents. Investm ents in equity securities are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the quarter. P rincipal active m arkets for equity prices include published exchanges such as the N YSE  and N asdaq Stock M arket. F oreign equity prices are translated from  their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active m arket. T here was no after-hours m arket activity that was required to be reflected in the reported fair value m easurem ents.\n\n## Investments in debt securities\n\nMost investm ents in debt securities are valued using Level 2 m easurem ents because the valuations use interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the term s of the debt instrum ent (m aturity and coupon interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. If the m arket for a particular fixed-incom e security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurem ent is Level 3.\n\n## Commodity derivatives\n\nCommodity derivatives with clearinghouses are classified as Level 1. C om m odity derivatives with observable forward curves are classified as Level 2. If forward price curves are not observable for the full term  of the contract and the unobservable period had m ore than an insignificant im pact on the valuation, the com m odity derivative is classified as Level 3. In isolation, increases (decreases) in natural gas forward prices result in favorable (unfavorable) fair value adjustm ents for natural gas purchase contracts; and increases (decreases) in electricity forward prices result in unfavorable (favorable) fair value adjustm ents for electricity sales contracts. D uke E nergy regularly evaluates and validates pricing inputs used to estim ate the fair value of certain com m odity contracts by a m arket participant price verification procedure. T his procedure provides a com parison of internal forward com m odity curves to m arket participant generated curves.\n\n## Interest rate derivatives\n\nMost over-the-counter interest rate contract derivatives are valued using financial m odels that utilize observable inputs for sim ilar instrum ents and are classified as Level 2. Inputs include forward interest rate curves, notional am ounts, interest rates and credit quality of the counterparties.\n\n## Foreign currency derivatives\n\nMost over-the-counter foreign currency derivatives are valued using financial m odels that utilize observable inputs for sim ilar instrum ents and are classified as Level 2. Inputs include forward foreign currency rate curves, notional am ounts, foreign currency rates and credit quality of the counterparties.\n\n## Other fair value considerations\n\nSee Note 2 for further inform ation on the valuation of the C om m ercial R enewables D isposal G roups.

The assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the derivative.\n\nAt FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause. See Note 3.\n\nIn NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NextEra Energy Resources, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income.\n\nFor interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. NEE estimates the fair v alue of these deriv ativ es using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing observable inputs.\n\nCertain derivative transactions at NEER are entered into as economic hedges but the transactions do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, hedge accounting treatment is not elected or hedge accounting has been discontinued. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility. These changes in fair value are reflected in the non-qualifying hedge category in computing  adjusted  earnings  and  could  be  significant  to  NEER's  results  because  the  economic  offset  to  the  positions  are  not  marked  to  market. A s  a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP . For this reason, NEE's management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark-to-market impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. For additional information regarding derivative instruments, see Note 3, Overview and Energy M arketing and Trading and M arket Risk Sensitivity.\n\n## Accounting for Pension Benefits\n\nNEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. M anagement believes that, based on actuarial assumptions and the well-funded status of the pension plan, NEE will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future. The qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing benefits under the plan. NEE allocates net periodic income associated with the pension plan to its subsidiaries annually using specific criteria.\n\n## Nature of Accounting Estimates\n\nFor the pension plan, the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value, as of the December 31 measurement date, of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date. The amount of benefit to be paid depends on a number of future events incorporated into the pension benefit formula, including an estimate of the average remaining life of employees/survivors as well as the average years of service rendered. The projected benefit obligation is measured based on assumptions concerning future interest rates and future employee compensation levels. NEE derives pension income from actuarial calculations based on the plan's provisions and various management assumptions including discount rate, rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\n\n## Assumptions and Accounting Approach\n\nAccounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in the year in which the changes occur. Since NEE is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, this accounting guidance is reflected at NEE and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs or credits that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic (income) cost in future periods and that otherwise would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at NEE in accordance with regulatory treatment.",

Southern Company (SO) emphasizes its strict credit policies, including internal credit ratings, collateral requirements, and netting agreements to manage counterparty exposure.

Its broad objectives are to achieve a high rate of total return with a prudent level of risk taking while maintaining sufficient liquidity and diversification to avoid large losses and preserve capital over the long term.\n\nThe NEE pension plan fund's current target asset allocation, which is expected to be reached over time, is 45% equity investments, 32% fixed income investments, 13% alternative investments and 10% convertible securities. The pension fund's investment strategy emphasizes traditional investments,  broadly  diversified  across  the  global  equity  and  fixed  income  markets,  using  a  combination  of  different  investment  styles  and vehicles.  The  pension  fund's  equity  and  fixed  income  holdings  consist  of  both  directly  held  securities  as  well  as  commingled  investment arrangements such as common and collective trusts, pooled separate accounts, registered investment companies and limited partnerships. The pension  fund's  convertible  security  assets  are  principally  direct  holdings  of  convertible  securities  and  include  a  convertible  security  oriented limited partnership. The pension fund's alternative investments consist primarily of private equity and real estate oriented investments in limited partnerships as well as absolute return oriented limited partnerships that use a broad range of investment strategies on a global basis.\n\nThe fair value measurements of NEE's pension plan assets by fair value hierarchy level are as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "Duke Energy emphasizes the potential for physical attacks to disrupt insurance markets, increase deductibles, and expose them to uncovered losses, particularly in the context of nuclear operations. NextEra Energy notes the existence of physical attacks on energy infrastructure in the past and outlines governance and cybersecurity frameworks to detect and respond to such threats, though no material impact has occurred. Southern Company includes physical attacks among a list of operational risks, particularly relevant to nuclear facilities, and notes that such threats could lead to increased compliance and licensing costs. Each company addresses physical attacks as part of broader risk management strategies, but with distinct focal points: Duke focuses on insurance and financial exposure, NextEra on governance and preparedness, and Southern on regulatory and compliance implications.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Assumptions and Accounting Approach\n\nAccounting guidance allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non-rate regulated entities. If NEE's rate-regulated entities, primarily FPL, were no longer subject to cost-based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the regulators, including the FPSC for FPL, have the authority to disallow recovery of costs that they consider excessive or imprudently incurred. Such costs may include, among others, fuel and O&amp;M  expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when generation facilities  are  unav ailable,  storm  restoration  costs  and  costs  associated  with  the  construction  or  acquisition  of  new  facilities.  The  continued  applicability   of regulatory accounting is assessed at each reporting period.\n\n## ENERGY MARKETING AND TRADING AND MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY\n\nNEE and FPL are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. Financial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of NEE and FPL described below are held primarily for purposes other than trading. M arket risk is measured as the potential loss in fair v alue resulting from hy pothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices, interest rates or equity prices over the next year. M anagement has established risk management policies to monitor and manage such market risks, as well as credit risks.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nNEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity . In addition, NEE, through NEER, uses derivatives to optimize the value of its power generation and natural gas and oil production assets and engages in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements. See Critical A ccounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging A ctivities and Note 3.\n\nDuring 2023 and 2024, the changes in the fair value of NEE's consolidated subsidiaries' energy contract derivative instruments were as follows:\n\n",

When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas positions, together with the longest hedge date over which the respective entity is hedging its ex posure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and the longest non-hedge date for derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows:\n\n",

Southern Company (SO) partners with municipalities through joint ownership agreements, power purchase agreements, and integrated transmission systems, including arrangements with MEAG Power and Dalton, which serve municipal electric systems.

      "answer": "Duke Energy Florida (DUK) explicitly identifies regulatory assets tied to storm and fuel cost recovery and notes that management must make judgments about the likelihood of future recovery based on regulatory precedents. NextEra Energy (NEE) addresses rate regulation in the context of asset retirement obligations (AROs), particularly for nuclear decommissioning and wind/solar dismantlement, where timing differences exist between financial reporting and rate recovery. Southern Company (SO) discusses regulatory assets as probable future revenues from costs expected to be recovered through the ratemaking process, with potential write-offs if operations are no longer rate-regulated. Each company reflects distinct regulatory asset exposures and assumptions about how regulatory decisions impact financial outcomes.",

In our opinion, the financial statem ents present fairly, in all m aterial respects, the financial position of the C om pany as of D ecem ber 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended D ecem ber 31, 2024, in conform ity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U nited States of Am erica.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statem ents are the responsibility of the C om pany's m anagem ent. O ur responsibility is to express an opinion on the C om pany's financial statem ents based on our audits. W e are a public accounting firm  registered with the P ublic C om pany Accounting O versight Board (U nited States) (P C AO B) and are required to be independent with respect to the C om pany in accordance with the U .S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and E xchange C om m ission and the P C AO B.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the P C AO B. Those standards require that we plan and perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statem ents are free of m aterial m isstatem ent, whether due to error or fraud. T he C om pany is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform , an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the C om pany's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included perform ing procedures to assess the risks of m aterial m isstatem ent of the financial statem ents, whether due to error or fraud, and perform ing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included exam ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the am ounts and disclosures in the financial statem ents. O ur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estim ates m ade by m anagem ent, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statem ents. W e believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit m atter com m unicated below is a m atter arising from  the current-period audit of the financial statem ents that was com m unicated or required to be com m unicated to the audit com m ittee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are m aterial to the financial statem ents and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or com plex judgm ents. T he com m unication of critical audit m atters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statem ents, taken as a whole, and we are not, by com m unicating the critical audit m atter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit m atter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nRegulatory Matters - Impact of R ate R egulation on the Financial Statements - R efer to N otes 1 and 4 to the financial statements.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Com pany is subject to rate regulation by the F lorida P ublic Service C om m ission (the 'C om m ission'), which has jurisdiction with respect to the electric rates of the C om pany. Managem ent has determ ined it m eets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statem ents under accounting principles generally accepted in the U nited States of Am erica. Judgm ent can be required to determ ine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in custom er rates. As discussed in N ote 4, regulatory proceedings in recent years have focused on the recoverability of storm and fuel costs. As a result, assessing the potential outcom es of future regulatory orders in F lorida requires m anagem ent judgm ent.\n\nWe identified the im pact of rate regulation related to regulatory assets as a critical audit m atter due to the judgm ents m ade by m anagem ent, including assum ptions regarding the outcom e of future decisions by the C om m ission to support its assertions on the likelihood of future recovery for deferred costs. G iven that m anagem ent's accounting judgm ents are based on assum ptions about the outcom e of future decisions by the C om m ission, auditing these judgm ents required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the ratem aking process due to its inherent com plexities as it relates to regulatory assets.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the recovery of regulatory assets included the following, am ong others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of m anagem ent's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of the recovery in future rates and the m onitoring and evaluation of regulatory developm ents that m ay affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates.\n- We evaluated the C om pany's disclosures related to the im pacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developm ents.\n- We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the C om m ission and other publicly available inform ation to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the C om m ission's treatm ent of sim ilar costs under sim ilar circum stances. W e evaluated the external inform ation and com pared it to m anagem ent's recorded balances for com pleteness.\n- For regulatory m atters in process, we inspected the C om pany's and intervenors' filings with the C om m ission, that m ay im pact the C om pany's future rates, for any evidence that m ight contradict m anagem ent's assertions.\n- We evaluated the reasonableness of m anagem ent's judgm ents regarding the recoverability of regulatory asset balances by perform ing the following to inform  our understanding of the com position of the balances:",

A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, the assets and liabilities of these V IEs consisted primarily of property , plant and equipment and accounts payable.\n\nOther - A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, several NEE subsidiaries had investments totaling approximately $5,848 million ($4,506 million at FPL) and $4,962 million ($3,899 million at FPL), respectively , which are included in special use funds and noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets and in special use funds on FPL's consolidated balance sheets. These investments represented primarily commingled funds and asset-backed securities. NEE subsidiaries, including FPL, are not the primary beneficiaries and therefore do not consolidate any of these entities because they do not control any of the ongoing activities of these entities, were not inv olv ed in the initial design of these entities and do not hav e a controlling financial interest in these entities.\n\nCertain subsidiaries of NEE have noncontrolling interests in entities accounted for under the equity method, including NEE's noncontrolling interest in X PLR OpCo (see Note 8). These entities are limited partnerships or similar entity structures in which the limited partners or non-managing members do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities, and therefore are considered V IEs. NEE is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have a controlling financial interest in these entities, and therefore does not consolidate any of these entities. NEE's investment in these entities totaled approximately $3,315 million and $3,913 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively . A t December 31, 2024, subsidiaries of NEE had guarantees related to certain obligations of one of these entities, as well as commitments to invest an additional approximately $175 million in several of these entities. See further discussion of such guarantees and commitments in Note 15 - Commitments and - Contracts, respectively.\n\n## 10. Leases\n\nNEE has operating and finance leases primarily related to land use agreements that convey exclusive use of the land during the arrangement for certain of its renewable energy projects and substations, as well as buildings and equipment. Operating and finance leases primarily have fixed payments with expected expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2083, with the exception of operating leases related to three land use agreements with an expiration date of 2106, some of which include options to extend the leases up to 34 years and some have options to terminate at NEE's discretion. A t December 31, 2024, NEE's ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases totaled approximately $372 million and $387 million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $396 million and $412 million. A t December 31, 2024, NEE's ROU assets and lease liabilities for finance leases totaled approximately $826 million and $840 million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $440 million and $444 million. NEE's lease liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were calculated using a weighted-average incremental borrowing rate at the lease inception of 3.83% and 3.96%, respectively , for operating leases and 4.92% and 4.32%, respectively , for finance leases, and a weighted-average remaining lease term of 44 years and 44 years, respectively , for operating leases and 33 years and 32 years, respectively , for finance leases. A t December 31, 2024, expected lease payments over the remaining terms of the leases were approximately $2.6 billion with no one year being material. Operating and finance lease-related amounts were not material to NEE's consolidated statements of income or cash flows for the periods presented.\n\nNEE has operating and sales-type leases primarily related to certain battery storage facilities and a natural gas and oil electric generation facility that sell their electric output under power sales agreements to third parties which provide the customers the ability to dispatch the facilities. A t December 31, 2024, the power sales agreements have expiration dates from 2026 to 2044 and NEE expects to receive approximately $3.9 billion of lease payments over the remaining terms of the  power  sales  agreements  with  no  one  year  being  material.  Operating  and  sales-type  lease-related  amounts  were  not  material  to  NEE's  consolidated statements of income or balance sheets for the periods presented.\n\n## 11. Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nNEE's AROs relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities. For NEE's rate-regulated operations, including FPL, the accounting provisions result in timing differences in the recognition of legal asset  retirement  costs  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  the  method  the  regulator  allows  for  recovery  in  rates.

Natural gas purchases made under these agreements were immaterial for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Power for all periods presented.\n\nAlabama Power and Mississippi Power jointly own Plant Greene County. The companies have an agreement under which Alabama Power operates Plant Greene County and Mississippi Power reimburses Alabama Power for its proportionate share of non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, which totaled $7 million, $5 million, and $6 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. See Notes 2 and 5 under \"Mississippi Power -Integrated Resource Plans\" and \"Joint Ownership Agreements,\" respectively, for additional information.\n\nAlabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power each have agreements with PowerSecure for equipment purchases and/or services related to utility infrastructure construction, distributed energy, and energy efficiency projects. Costs under these agreements were immaterial for all periods presented.\n\nSouthern Company Gas has a $74 million contract with the U.S. General Services Administration to increase energy efficiency at certain federal buildings across Georgia, which is expected to be completed in 2025. Southern Company Gas engaged PowerSecure to provide the majority of the construction services under the contract. During 2024, 2023, and 2022, Southern Company Gas paid $13 million, $29 million, and $10 million, respectively, to PowerSecure related to this agreement.\n\nSee Note 7 under \"SEGCO\" for information regarding Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's equity method investment in SEGCO and related affiliate purchased power costs, as well as Alabama Power's gas pipeline ownership agreement with SEGCO.\n\nSouthern Power has several agreements with SCS for transmission services, which are billed to Southern Power based on the Southern Company Open Access Transmission Tariff as filed with the FERC. Transmission services purchased by Southern Power from SCS totaled $25 million, $33 million, and $39 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and were charged to other operations and maintenance expenses in Southern Power's consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may jointly enter into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly or through SCS as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 14 under \"Contingent Features\" for additional information. Southern Power and the traditional electric operating companies generally settle amounts related to the above transactions on a monthly basis in the month following the performance of such services or the purchase or sale of electricity. See \"Revenues - Southern Power\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas provide incidental services to and receive such services from other Southern Company subsidiaries which are generally minor in duration and amount. Except as described herein, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas neither provided nor received any material services to or from affiliates in any year presented.\n\n## Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to accounting requirements for the effects of rate regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent costs recovered that are ex pected to be incurred in the future or probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers through the ratemaking process.\n\nIn the event that a portion of a traditional electric operating company's or a natural gas distribution utility's operations is no longer subject to applicable accounting rules for rate regulation, such company would be required to write off to income or reclassify to AOCI related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the traditional electric operating company or the natural gas distribution utility would be required to determine if any impairment to other assets, including plant, ex ists and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair values. All regulatory assets and liabilities are to be reflected in rates. See Note 2 for additional information including details of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected in the balance sheets for Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas.\n\n## Revenues\n\nThe Registrants generate revenues from a variety of sources which are accounted for under various revenue accounting guidance, including revenue from contracts with customers, lease, derivative, and regulatory accounting.

NextEra Energy highlights that weather significantly affects its natural gas and oil production, as well as its ability to meet full energy and capacity requirements under PPAs, potentially increasing supply costs. Southern Company explains that weather conditions directly impact the energy output of its solar and wind facilities, which affects its ability to recover fixed and variable operating expenses under long-term PPAs.

          "chunk_text": "## Dividend Payments\n\nI n 2024, D uke E nergy paid quarterly cash dividends for the 98th consecutive year and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future. T here is no assurance as to the am ount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings, capital requirem ents, financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.\n\nDuke E nergy targets a dividend payout ratio of between 60% and 70%, based upon adjusted E P S. D uke E nergy increased the dividend by approxim ately 2% annually in both 2024 and 2023, and the C om pany rem ains com m itted to continued growth of the dividend.\n\n## Dividend and Other Funding R estrictions of D uke E nergy Subsidiaries\n\nAs discussed in N ote 4 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, 'R egulatory M atters,' D uke E nergy's public utility operating com panies have restrictions on the am ount of funds that can be transferred to D uke E nergy through dividends, advances or loans as a result of conditions im posed by various regulators in conjunction with m erger transactions. D uke E nergy Progress and D uke E nergy Florida also have restrictions im posed by their first m ortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation, which in certain circum stances, lim it their ability to m ake cash dividends or distributions on com m on stock. Additionally, certain other D uke E nergy subsidiaries have other restrictions, such as m inim um  working capital and tangible net worth requirem ents pursuant to debt and other agreem ents that lim it the am ount of funds that can be transferred to D uke E nergy. At D ecem ber 31, 2024, the am ount of restricted net assets of subsidiaries of D uke E nergy that m ay not be distributed to D uke E nergy in the form  of a loan or dividend does not exceed a m aterial am ount of D uke E nergy's net assets. Other than a prohibition from  declaring com m on stock dividends should dividend paym ents be deferred on the Series A P referred Stock, D uke E nergy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying com m on stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated equity accounts. Although these restrictions cap the am ount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to D uke E nergy, m anagem ent does not believe these restrictions will have a significant im pact on D uke E nergy's ability to access cash to m eet its paym ent of dividends on com m on stock and other future funding obligations.\n\n## Cash Flows From Operating Activities\n\nCash flows from  operations of E U &amp;I and G U &amp;I are prim arily driven by sales of electricity and natural gas, respectively, and costs of operations. T hese cash flows from  operations are relatively stable and com prise a substantial portion of D uke E nergy's operating cash flows. W eather conditions, working capital and com m odity price fluctuations and unanticipated expenses including unplanned plant outages, storm s, legal costs and related settlem ents can affect the tim ing and level of cash flows from  operations.\n\nAs part of D uke E nergy's continued effort to im prove its cash flows from  operations and liquidity, D uke E nergy works with vendors to im prove term s and conditions, including the extension of paym ent term s. T o support this effort, D uke E nergy has a voluntary supply chain finance program  (the 'program ') under which suppliers, at their sole discretion, m ay sell their receivables from  D uke E nergy to the participating financial institution. T he financial institution adm inisters the program . D uke E nergy does not issue any guarantees with respect to the program  and does not participate in negotiations between suppliers and the financial institution. D uke E nergy does not have an econom ic interest in the supplier's decision to participate in the program  and receives no interest, fees or other benefit from  the financial institution based on supplier participation in the program . Suppliers' decisions on which invoices are sold do not im pact D uke E nergy's paym ent term s, which are based on com m ercial term s negotiated between D uke E nergy and the supplier regardless of program participation. A significant deterioration in the credit quality of D uke E nergy, econom ic downturn or changes in the financial m arkets could lim it the financial institutions willingness to participate in the program . D uke E nergy does not believe such risk would have a m aterial im pact on our cash flows from  operations or liquidity, as substantially all our paym ents are made outside the program .\n\nDuke E nergy believes it has sufficient liquidity resources through the com m ercial paper m arkets, and ultim ately, the M aster C redit F acility, to support these operations. C ash flows from operations are subject to a num ber of other factors, including, but not lim ited to, regulatory constraints, econom ic trends and m arket volatility (see Item  1A, 'R isk F actors,' for additional inform ation).\n\n## Debt and E quity Issuances\n\nDepending on availability based on the issuing entity, the credit rating of the issuing entity, and m arket conditions, the Subsidiary R egistrants prefer to issue first m ortgage bonds and secured debt, followed by unsecured debt. This preference is the result of generally higher credit ratings for first m ortgage bonds and secured debt, which typically result in lower interest costs. D uke E nergy C orporation prim arily issues unsecured debt.\n\nI n 2025, D uke E nergy anticipates issuing additional securities of $12.2 billion through debt capital m arkets. In certain instances, D uke E nergy m ay utilize instrum ents other than senior notes, including equity-content securities such as subordinated debt or preferred stock. P roceeds will prim arily be for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and debt m aturities. See Note 7 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"D ebt and C redit F acilities,\" for further inform ation regarding significant debt issuances. In addition, in order to fund increm ental growth capital, D uke E nergy plans to issue $6.5 billion of com m on stock equity from  2025-2029, including $1 billion in 2025, through the dividend reinvestm ent and AT M  program s. See Note 20 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, 'Stockholders' E quity' for further details.\n\nDuke E nergy's capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the table below.\n\n",

Such events or actions may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nThe ability of NE E  and F PL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NE E 's and F PL's insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses.\n\nInsurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be available at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to NEE and FPL. The ability of NEE and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, including impacts of actual or perceived climate-related events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. If NEE or FPL cannot or does not obtain insurance coverage, NEE or FPL may be required to pay costs associated with adverse future events. A dditionally , if certain unconsolidated subsidiaries of NEE do not obtain third-party insurance coverage, NEE may be required to pay costs associated with losses or adverse future events involving these entities.\n\nNEE and FPL generally are not fully insured against all significant losses. For example, NEE, including FPL, does not have property insurance coverage for a substantial portion of its transmission and distribution property and natural gas pipeline assets. A  loss for which NEE or FPL is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE invests in natural gas and oil production assets which are exposed to fluctuating market prices of natural gas, natural gas liquids, oil and other energy commodities. A prolonged period of low natural gas and oil prices, disrupted production or unsuccessful drilling efforts could impact NEER's natural gas and oil production operations and cause NEER to delay or cancel certain natural gas and oil production projects and could result in certain assets becoming impaired, which could materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNatural gas and oil prices are affected by supply and demand, both globally and regionally . Factors that influence supply and demand include operational issues, natural  disasters,  weather,  political  instability ,  conflicts,  new  discov eries,  technological  adv ances,  economic  conditions  and  actions  by   major  oil-producing countries. There can be significant volatility in market prices for natural gas and oil, and price fluctuations could have a material effect on the financial performance of natural gas and oil producing assets. For example, in a low natural gas and oil price environment, NEER would generate less revenue from its investments in natural gas and oil production properties, and as a result certain investments might become less profitable or incur losses. A dditionally , production could be disrupted due to weather or operational issues, among other causes, or drilling efforts could be unsuccessful. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices or low production, including from unsuccessful drilling efforts, could also result in the delay or cancellation of natural gas and oil production projects, could cause projects to experience lower returns, and could result in certain assets becoming impaired, which could materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nIf cost recovery arrangements for increased supply costs necessary to provide NEER's full energy and capacity requirements services are not favorable, operating costs could increase and materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEER provides full energy and capacity requirements services  primarily  to  distribution  utilities,  which  include  load-following  serv ices  and  v arious  ancillary services, to satisfy all or a portion of such utilities' power supply obligations to their customers. The supply costs for these transactions may be affected by a number  of  factors,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  ev ents  that  may   occur  after  such  utilities  hav e  committed  to  supply   power,  such  as  weather  conditions, transmission constraints, fluctuating prices for, and locational disconnects in, energy and ancillary services, and the ability of the distribution utilities' customers to elect to receive service from competing suppliers. If any of these factors materialize, NEER may not be able to recover all of its increased supply costs, which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nDue to the potential for significant volatility in market prices for fuel, electricity and environmental and other energy-related commodities, NE E 's inability or failure to manage properly or hedge effectively the commodity risks within its portfolio could materially adversely affect NE E 's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nThere can be significant volatility in market prices for fuel, electricity and environmental and other energy-related commodities, both in general and across geographies. NEE's inability or failure to manage properly or hedge effectively its assets or positions against changes in commodity prices, volumes, interest rates, counterparty credit risk or other risk measures, based on factors that are either within, or wholly or partially outside of, NEE's control, may materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.\n\nAs a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.\n\nCapacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Long-Term Service Agreements\" for additional information.\n\n## Solar and Wind\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n## Income Tax Matters\n\n## Consolidated Income Taxes\n\nThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax  credits. See \"Tax Credits\" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Tax Credits\n\nSouthern Company receives ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, advanced nuclear, hydroelectric, and battery energy storage facilities primarily at Southern Power, G eorgia Power, and Alabama Power.\n\nSouthern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with ex isting solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind and solar facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $765 million and $384 million, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently projected to be fully utilized by 2028 but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has utilized tax equity partnerships for certain wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax  equity partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax  benefits. These tax  equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses.\n\nIn the third quarter 2023 and the second quarter 2024, Georgia Power started generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively, beginning on each unit's respective in-service date. PTCs are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production. In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule\"), Georgia Power is purchasing advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the other Vogtle Owners. The gain recognized on the purchase of the joint owner PTCs is recognized as an income tax benefit. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) generated only 1.8% of its total energy from hydroelectric and solar sources in 2023, indicating a minimal reliance on solar power within its generation mix. In contrast, NextEra Energy (NEE) operated solar facilities with approximately 7,650 MW of total generating capacity at the end of 2023, demonstrating a significant commitment to solar generation. Southern Company (SO) reported 358,106 KW (or ~358 MW) of solar capacity across various facilities in Georgia and Mississippi, showing a moderate but tangible investment in solar infrastructure. These differences highlight DUK's current fossil-fuel focus, NEE's leadership in solar deployment, and SO's regional solar development as part of its broader generation portfolio.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy highlights the financial burden of complying with new EPA regulations, such as those issued in April 2024, which may require additional capital expenditures and increase operating costs. NextEra Energy emphasizes the operational risks from more frequent and intense weather events linked to climate change, particularly in Florida, which could damage infrastructure and increase restoration costs. Southern Company notes that global climate change is influencing customer and stakeholder sustainability goals, potentially reshaping demand for energy and accelerating the adoption of distributed energy resources, which could erode market share and reduce the value of existing generation assets. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies face climate-related risks, they differ in how they prioritize regulatory, physical, and market-driven impacts.",

          "chunk_text": "## RISK FACTORS\n\nenvironm ental laws or regulations to m ore stringent com pliance levels could, and are likely to, result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or developm ent of new facilities being prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. T he costs to com ply with environm ental laws and regulations could have a m aterial effect on the D uke E nergy Registrants' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThe E P A has issued or proposed federal regulations, including the new rules issued in April 2024, governing the m anagem ent of wastewater, C C R  m anagem ent units and C O emissions. N ew state legislation in response to such regulations could im pose carbon reduction goals that are m ore aggressive than the C om pany's plans. T hese regulations m ay require the D uke E nergy R egistrants to m ake additional capital expenditures and increase operating and m aintenance costs. 2\n\n## The Duke E nergy R egistrants' operations, capital expenditures and financial results may be affected by regulatory changes related to the impacts of global climate change.\n\nThere is continued concern, and increasing and conflicting activism , both nationally and internationally, about clim ate change. T he E P A and state regulators have, and m ay adopt and im plem ent, additional regulations to restrict em issions of G H G s to address global clim ate change, as well as reporting requirem ents regarding such em issions and related clim ate-goal claim s. C ertain local and state jurisdictions have also enacted laws to restrict or prevent new natural gas infrastructure. Increased regulation of G H G  em issions and reporting requirem ents could im pose significant additional costs on the D uke E nergy R egistrants' electric and natural gas operations, their suppliers and custom ers and affect dem and for energy conservation and renewable products, which could im pact both our electric and natural gas businesses. R egulatory changes and/or uncertainty of applicability of such legislative and regulatory initiatives could also result in generation facilities to be retired earlier than planned to m eet our net-zero 2050 goal. T hough we would plan to seek cost recovery for investm ents related to G H G  em issions reductions through regulatory rate structures, changes in the regulatory clim ate could result in the delay in or failure to fully recover such costs and investm ent in generation.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\n## The Duke E nergy R egistrants' results of operations may be negatively affected by overall market, economic and other conditions that are beyond their control.\n\nSustained downturns or sluggishness in the econom y generally affect the m arkets in which the D uke E nergy R egistrants operate and negatively influence operations. D eclines in demand for electricity or natural gas as a result of econom ic downturns in the D uke E nergy R egistrants' regulated service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial custom ers reduce production and, therefore, consum ption of electricity and the use of natural gas. Although the D uke E nergy R egistrants' regulated electric and natural gas businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs, such as fuel and purchased natural gas costs, under periodic adjustm ent clauses, overall declines in electricity or natural gas sold as a result of econom ic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby dim inishing results of operations.\n\nA continuation of adverse econom ic conditions including econom ic downturn or high com m odity prices could also negatively im pact the financial stability of certain of our custom ers and result in their inability to pay for electric and natural gas services. T his could lead to increased bad debt expense and higher allowance for doubtful account reserves for the D uke Energy R egistrants and result in delayed or unrecovered operating costs and lower financial results. Additionally, prolonged econom ic downturns that negatively im pact the D uke Energy R egistrants' results of operations and cash flows could result in future m aterial im pairm ent charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair values. T he D uke E nergy R egistrants also m onitor the im pacts of inflation on the procurem ent of goods and services and seek to m inim ize its effects in future periods through pricing strategies, productivity im provem ents, and cost reductions. R apidly rising prices as a result of inflation, tariffs, or other factors m ay im pact the ability of the Company to recover costs tim ely or execute on its business strategy including the achievem ent of growth objectives.\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants sell electricity into the spot m arket or other com petitive power m arkets on a contractual basis. W ith respect to such transactions, the D uke E nergy Registrants are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investm ents through m andated rates, and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing m arket prices. T hese m arket prices m ay fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of tim e and could negatively im pact the C om pany's ability to accurately forecast the financial im pact or reduce the D uke E nergy R egistrants' revenues and m argins, thereby dim inishing results of operations.\n\nFactors that could im pact sales volum es, generation of electricity and m arket prices at which the D uke E nergy R egistrants are able to sell electricity and natural gas are as follows:\n\n- weather conditions, including extrem e winter or sum m er weather that could cause significantly lower or higher dem and for energy or natural gas usage for heating or cooling purposes, as applicable, storm -related custom er outages resulting in lower usage, or periods of low rainfall that decrease the ability to operate facilities in an econom ical m anner;\n- supply of and dem and for energy com m odities, including potential usage of electricity by data centers;\n- transm ission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies;\n- availability of purchased power;\n- availability of com petitively priced alternative energy sources, which are preferred by som e custom ers over electricity produced from  coal, nuclear or natural gas plants, and custom er usage of energy-efficient equipm ent that reduces energy dem and;\n- natural gas, crude oil and refined products production levels and prices;\n- ability to procure satisfactory levels of inventory, including m aterials, supplies, and fuel such as coal, natural gas and uranium ; and\n- capacity and transm ission service into, or out of, the D uke E nergy R egistrants' m arkets.",

Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of NEE and FPL, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand side management requirements, installation of distributed generation technologies and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation, expanded use of data centers, inflation and the overall level of economic activity . A  lack of growth, or a decline, in the number of customers or in  customer  demand  for  electricity  or  natural  gas  and  other  fuels  may  cause  NEE  and  FPL  to  fail  to  fully   realiz e  the  anticipated  benefits  from  significant investments and expenditures and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's growth, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and F PL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions and related impacts, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather.\n\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and other fuels and affect the price of energy and energy-related commodities. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, droughts, extreme temperatures, icing events, wildfires, severe convective storms and earthquakes, can be destructive and cause power outages, personal injury and property damage, reduce revenue, affect the availability of fuel and water, and require NEE and FPL to incur additional costs, for example, to restore service and repair damaged facilities, to obtain replacement power, to access available financing sources, to obtain insurance, to pay for any associated injuries and damages and to fund any associated legal matters and compliance penalties. Furthermore, NEE's and FPL's physical plants could be placed at greater risk of damage should changes in the global climate produce unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, particularly relevant to FPL, a change in sea level. FPL operates in the east and lower west coasts of Florida and in northwest Florida, areas that historically have been prone to severe weather events, such as hurricanes. A  disruption or failure of electric generation, transmission or distribution systems or natural gas production, transmission, storage or distribution systems in the event of a hurricane, tornado or other severe weather event, or otherwise, could prevent NEE and FPL from operating their business in the normal course and could result in any of the adverse consequences described above. A dditionally , the actions taken to address the potential for severe weather such as additional winterizing of critical equipment and infrastructure, modifying or alternating plant operations and expanding load shedding options could result in significant increases in costs. A ny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nAt FPL and other businesses of NEE where cost recovery is available, recovery of costs to restore service, to repair damaged facilities or for other actions to address severe weather is or may be subject to regulatory approval, and any determination by the regulator not to permit timely and full recovery of the costs incurred could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nChanges in weather can also affect the production of electricity at power generation facilities, including, but not limited to, NEER's wind and solar facilities. For example, the level of wind resource affects the revenue produced by wind generation facilities. Because the levels of wind and solar resources are variable and difficult to predict, NEER's results of operations for individual wind and solar facilities specifically , and NEE's results of operations generally , may vary significantly from period to period, depending on the level of available resources. T o the extent that resources are not available at planned levels, the financial results from these facilities may be less than expected.\n\nThreats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from geopolitical factors, terrorism, cyberattacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt NEE 's and F PL's business, or the businesses of third parties, may materially adversely affect NE E 's and F PL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE and FPL are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of geopolitical factors, terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyberattacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups. There have been cyberattacks and other physical attacks within the energy industry on energy infrastructure such as substations, gas pipelines and related assets in the past and there may be such attacks in the future.  In addition, the advancement of artificial intelligence has given rise to added vulnerabilities and potential entry points for cyberattacks. NEE's and FPL's generation, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems could be direct targets of, or otherwise be materially adversely affected by, such activities.\n\nGeopolitical factors, terrorist acts, cy berattacks or other similar ev ents affecting NEE's and FPL's systems and facilities, or those of third parties on which NEE and FPL rely , could harm NEE's and FPL's businesses by , for example, limiting their ability to generate, purchase, store or transmit power, natural gas or other energy-related commodities, limiting their ability to bill customers and collect and process payments, and delaying their development and construction of new generation, distribution, storage or transmission facilities or capital improvements to existing facilities. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result  in  a  material  decrease  in  rev enues,  significant  additional  costs  (for  ex ample,  to  repair  assets,  implement  additional  security   requirements  or maintain or acquire insurance), significant fines and penalties, and reputational damage, could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's operations (for example, by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels), and could impair NEE's and FPL's ability to raise capital (for example, by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity). In addition, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted",

Any impact to their water resources could also limit the ability of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power to operate certain facilities, which could result in higher fuel and operating costs.\n\nThe revenues of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power depend in part on sales under PPAs, the success of which depend on PPA counterparties performing their obligations, Southern Company subsidiaries satisfying minimum requirements under the PPAs, and renewal or replacement of the PPAs for the related generating capacity.\n\nMost of Southern Power's generating capacity has been sold to purchasers under PPAs with Southern Power's top three customers comprising approximately 24% of Southern Power's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition to Mississippi Power's PPA with Georgia Power, the traditional electric operating companies have entered into PPAs with non-affiliated parties for the sale of generating capacity.\n\nThe revenues related to PPAs are dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of their obligations. Although the credit evaluations undertaken and contractual protections implemented by Southern Power and the traditional electric operating companies take into account the possibility of default by a purchaser, actual exposure to a default by a purchaser may be greater than predicted or specified in the applicable contract.\n\nAdditionally, neither Southern Power nor any traditional electric operating company can predict whether the PPAs will be renewed at the end of their respective terms or on what terms any renewals may be made. If a Registrant is unable to replace expiring PPAs with an acceptable new revenue contract, it may be required to sell the power produced by the facility at wholesale prices and be exposed to market fluctuations and risks, or the affected site may temporarily or permanently cease operations, which may result in impairment charges. The failure to satisfy minimum operational or availability requirements under these PPAs, including PPAs related to projects under construction, could result in payment of damages or termination of the PPAs.\n\n## Increased competition from other companies that supply energy or generation and storage technologies and changes in customer demand for energy could negatively impact Southern Company and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies operate under a business model that invests capital to serve customers and recovers those investments and earns a return for investors through state regulation. Southern Power's business model is primarily focused on investing capital or building energy assets to serve creditworthy counterparties using a bilateral contract model. A key premise of these business models is that generating power at power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive cost.\n\nCustomers and stakeholders are increasingly focused on the Registrants' ability to meet rapidly changing demands for new and varied products, services, and offerings. Additionally, the risk of global climate change continues to shape customers' and stakeholders' sustainability goals and energy needs.\n\nNew technologies such as distributed energy resources and microgrids and increased customer and stakeholder demand for sustainable assets could change the type of assets constructed and/or the methods for cost recovery. Advances in these technologies or changes in laws or regulations could reduce the cost of distributed generation storage technologies or other alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most power generation production or result in smaller-scale, more fuel efficient, and/or more cost effective distributed generation that allows for increased self-generation by customers. Broader use of distributed generation by energy customers may also result from customers' changing perceptions of the merits of utilizing existing generation technology or tax or other economic incentives. Additionally, state PSCs or legislatures may modify certain aspects of the traditional electric operating companies' businesses as a result of these advances in technology, which may provide for further competition from these alternative sources of generation.\n\nIt is also possible that rapid advances in power generation technology could reduce the value of the current electric generating facilities owned by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize power.\n\nSouthern Company Gas' business is dependent on natural gas prices remaining competitive as compared to other forms of energy. Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services segment also is affected by competition from other energy marketers providing similar services in Southern Company Gas' unregulated service territories, most notably in Illinois and G eorgia.\n\nIf new technologies become cost competitive and achieve sufficient scale, the market share of the Subsidiary Registrants could be eroded, and the value of their respective electric generating facilities or natural gas distribution facilities could be reduced. Additionally, these technology- and customer-induced changes to the Subsidiary Registrants' business models could change the risk profile of the Southern Company system's historical capital investments. Southern Company Gas' market share could be reduced if Southern Company Gas cannot remain price competitive in its unregulated markets.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) includes municipalities as part of its wholesale customer base, supplying energy that contributes to total sales which encompass both retail and wholesale segments, including incorporated municipalities. NextEra Energy (NEE) has significant credit exposure to municipalities through its energy marketing and trading operations, with $2.6 billion in total credit risk exposure as of December 31, 2024, though 88% of this exposure is with investment-grade counterparties. Southern Company (SO) engages with municipalities through long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) and transmission agreements, including arrangements with MEAG Power and Dalton, reflecting a structured and diversified approach to municipal energy delivery.

NEE's  credit  department  monitors  current  and  forward  credit  exposure  to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis. For all derivative and contractual transactions, NEE's energy marketing and trading operations, which include FPL's energy marketing and trading division, are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions. Some relevant considerations when assessing NEE's energy marketing and trading operations' credit risk exposure include the following:\n\n- Operations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry.\n- Trade receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy , utility and financial services related companies, as well as municipalities, cooperatives and other trading companies in the U.S.\n- Overall credit risk is managed through established credit policies and is overseen by the EM C.\n- Prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards, with customers not meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as letters of credit or the posting of margin cash collateral.\n- Master netting agreements are used to offset cash and noncash gains and losses arising from derivative instruments with the same counterparty . NEE's policy is to have master netting agreements in place with significant counterparties.\n\nBased on NEE's policies and risk exposures related to credit, NEE and FPL do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance.

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) emphasizes its Enterprise Risk Management framework, which includes market risk as part of financial and transaction-related risks. It specifically highlights exposure to commodity price risk in electricity, coal, natural gas, and other energy-related products, and notes that the Chief Risk Officer is responsible for monitoring exposure limits. NextEra Energy (NEE) discloses that it uses derivative instruments such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards to manage physical and financial risks in fuel and electricity purchases and sales, and engages in trading to capitalize on expected price movements. Southern Company (SO) also uses derivatives to manage commodity and interest rate exposures, but notes that these instruments may not always fully offset the underlying risk, and highlights the potential for volatility in fair value and net income due to market fluctuations. Together, these disclosures show a shared reliance on derivatives for risk mitigation, but with differing emphases on exposure types and risk governance structures.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe variance was driven primarily by:\n\n- a $1,934 million net increase in proceeds from issuances of long-term debt, primarily due to timing of issuances and redemptions of longterm debt;\n- a $1,149 million increase in contributions from noncontrolling interests, primarily due to a $1,025 million receipt from GIC to make an indirect minority interest investment of 11.05% in Duke Energy Indiana; and\n- a $798 million increase in net borrowings from notes payable and commercial paper.\n\nPartially offset by:\n\n- a $2,740 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock.\n\n## QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n## Risk Management Policies\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management policy framework at Duke Energy includes strategy, operational, project execution and financial or transaction related risks. Enterprise Risk Management includes market risk as part of the financial and transaction related risks in its framework.\n\nDuke Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. Duke Energy has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke Energy's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors receives periodic updates from the Chief Risk Officer and other members of management on market risk positions, corporate exposures and overall risk management activities. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits.\n\nThe following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. See Item 1A, 'Risk Factors,' and 'Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information' for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward-looking statements made herein.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nPrice risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energy's exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including the effects of regulation, commodity contract size and length, market liquidity, market conditions, location and unique or specific contract terms. Duke Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy-related assets.",

Financial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of NEE and FPL described below are held primarily for purposes other than trading. Market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value resulting from hypothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices, interest rates or equity prices over the next year. Management has established risk management policies to monitor and manage such market risks, as well as credit risks.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nNEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity. In addition, NEE, through NEER, uses derivatives to optimize the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets and engages in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities and Note 3.\n\nDuring 2020 and 2021, the changes in the fair value of NEE's consolidated subsidiaries' energy contract derivative instruments were as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "costs of financing. The discontinuation, reform, or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual relationships in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets and could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of, and market for the Registrants' and Southern Company Gas Capital's securities and other instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark. Additionally, any replacement benchmark rates may be relatively new, be fundamentally different from LIBOR, and be more volatile than other benchmark or market rates. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate has been identified as the current replacement benchmark rate for LIBOR in the United States. Uncertainty as to the nature of the phase-out of LIBOR and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial markets could cause interest rates to increase. If sources of capital for the Registrants or Nicor Gas are reduced, capital costs could increase materially.\n\n## Failure to comply with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the ability of the Registrants, SEGCO, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas to execute future borrowings.\n\nThe debt and credit agreements of the Registrants, SEGCO, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas contain various financial and other covenants. Georgia Power's loan guarantee agreement with the DOE contains additional covenants, events of default, and mandatory prepayment events relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements.\n\n## Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the funding available for nuclear decommissioning.\n\nThe costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan, changes in actuarial assumptions, government regulations, and/or life expectancy, and the frequency and amount of the Southern Company system's required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and the Southern Company system could be required from time to time to fund the pension plans with significant amounts of cash. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\" in Item 7 herein and Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding the defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Additionally, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each hold significant assets in their nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission their nuclear plants. The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the funding available for decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts. See Note 6 to the financial statements under \"Nuclear Decommissioning\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## The Registrants are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs.\n\nThe financial condition of some insurance companies, actual or threatened physical or cyber attacks, natural disasters, and an increased focus on climate issues, among other things, could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. The availability of insurance may decrease, and the insurance that the Registrants are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms. Further, the insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred.\n\n## The use of derivative contracts by Southern Company and its subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in financial losses that negatively impact the net income of the Registrants or in reported net income volatility.\n\nSouthern Company and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards, to manage their commodity and interest rate exposures and, to a lesser extent, manage foreign currency exchange rate exposure and engage in limited trading activities. The Registrants could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. These risks are managed through risk management policies, limits, and procedures, which might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with these activities. In addition, derivative contracts entered into for hedging purposes might not offset the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in financial losses. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. The factors used in the valuation of these instruments become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable further into the future. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.\n\nSee Notes 13 and 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.",

Sales growth is expected within the service territory but continues to be impacted by adoption of energy efficiencies and self-generation. Residential sales increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to customer growth and the introduction of a hybrid work environment in response to multiple waves of COVID-19 during 2021. Meanwhile, sales for general service and industrial customers recovered in 2021 from temporary closings and ramp backs experienced in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the longer time frame, it is still expected that the continued adoption of more efficient housing and appliances will have a negative impact on average usage per residential customer over time.\n\n## Seasonality and the Impact of Weather\n\nRevenues and costs are influenced by seasonal weather patterns. Peak sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months, which results in higher revenue and cash flows during these periods. By contrast, lower sales of electricity occur during the spring and fall, allowing for scheduled plant maintenance. Residential and general service customers are more impacted by weather than industrial customers. Estimated weather impacts are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather conditions. Normal weather conditions are defined as the long-term average of actual historical weather conditions.\n\nThe estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the temperature variances from a normal condition and customers' historic usage patterns.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Retail Base\n\nThe FPL segment's retail base revenues for 2021 and 2020 reflect the 2016 rate agreement. In December 2016, the FPSC issued a final order approving  the  2016  rate  agreement  which  became  effective  in  January  2017  and  remained  in  effect  until  December  2021.  The  2016  rate agreement established the FPL segment's allowed regulatory ROE at 10.55%, with a range of 9.60% to 11.60%, and allowed for retail rate base increases in 2017, 2018, and upon commencement of commercial operations at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and certain solar projects. See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Base Rates - Base Rates Effective January 2017 through December 2021 for additional information on the 2016 rate agreement.\n\nRetail base revenues decreased $9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 and were impacted by a decrease of 2.6% in the average usage per retail customer, primarily related to unfavorable weather when compared to the prior year, partly offset by an increase of 1.5% in the average number of customer accounts. See Note 1 - Rate Regulation.\n\n## Cost Recovery Clauses\n\nRevenues  from  fuel  and  other  cost  recovery  clauses  and  pass-through  costs,  such  as  franchise  fees,  revenue  taxes  and  storm-related surcharges, are largely a pass-through of costs. Such revenues also include a return on investment allowed to be recovered through the cost recovery  clauses  on  certain  assets,  primarily  related  to  certain  solar,  environmental  projects,  storm  protection  plan  investments  and  the unamortized balance of the regulatory asset associated with the FPL segment's acquisition of certain generation facilities. See Item 1. Business FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Cost Recovery Clauses. Underrecovery or overrecovery of cost recovery clause and other pass-through costs (deferred clause and franchise expenses and revenues) can significantly affect NEE's and FPL's operating cash flows. The 2021 net underrecovery impacting the FPL segment's operating cash flows was approximately $516 million, primarily related to the fuel cost recovery clause.\n\nFuel cost recovery revenues increased approximately $775 million in 2021 primarily as a result of higher fuel and energy prices. In 2021 and 2020, cost recovery clauses contributed approximately $124 million and $111 million, respectively, to the FPL segment's net income. FPL's fuel cost recovery clause revenues and expenses are expected to increase in 2022 as a result of the collection of underrecovered 2021 fuel costs and higher projected natural gas prices in 2022.\n\n## Other Items Impacting the FPL Segment's Consolidated Statements of Income\n\nFuel, Purchase Power and Interchange Expense\n\nFuel, purchased power and interchange expense increased $807 million in 2021 primarily related to higher fuel and energy prices.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization Expense\n\nThe major components of the FPL segment's depreciation and amortization expense are as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Operating Revenues\n\nTotal operating revenues include PPA capacity revenues, which are derived primarily from long-term contracts involving natural gas facilities, and PPA energy revenues from Southern Power's generation facilities. To the extent Southern Power has capacity not contracted under a PPA, it may sell power into an accessible wholesale market, or, to the extent those generation assets are part of the FERC-approved IIC, it may sell power into the Southern Company power pool.\n\n## Natural Gas Capacity and Energy Revenue\n\nCapacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to operating income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment.\n\nEnergy is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published natural gas indices. Energy revenues will vary depending on the energy demand of Southern Power's customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Southern Power's energy. Energy revenues also include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges. Increases and decreases in energy revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel or purchased power prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income.\n\n## Solar and Wind Energy Revenue\n\nSouthern Power's energy sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs that do not have capacity revenue.

          "chunk_text": "One of the most significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units under the market approach is implied market multiples for certain peer companies. Management selects comparable peers based on each peer's primary business mix, operations, and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market values as of August 31. The implied market multiples used for calculating the fair values as of August 31, 2021, for each of Duke Energy's reporting units ranged from 9.7 to 12.7.\n\nDuke Energy primarily operates in environments that are rate-regulated. In such environments, revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs, sales volumes and costs of capital. Accordingly, Duke Energy's regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects, positive or negative, of significant swings in market or economic conditions. However, significant changes in discount rates or implied market multiples over a prolonged period may have a material impact on the fair value of equity.\n\nDuke Energy has approximately $19.3 billion in Goodwill at both December 31, 2021, and 2020. For further information, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\"\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nAROs are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment at the present value of the projected liability in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Duke Energy has approximately $12.8 billion and $13 billion of AROs as of December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. See Note 9, \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" for further details including a rollforward of related liabilities.\n\nThe present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, regulatory, legal, and legislative decisions, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among other factors. These estimates are subject to change.\n\nObligations for nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress assume prompt dismantlement of the nuclear facilities after operations are ceased. During 2020, Duke Energy Florida, closed an agreement for the accelerated decommissioning of the Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station after receiving approval from the NRC and FPSC. The retirement obligations for the decommissioning of Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station are measured based on accelerated decommissioning from 2020 continuing through 2027. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also assume that spent fuel will be stored on-site until such time that it can be transferred to a yet to be built DOE facility.\n\nObligations for closure of ash basins are based upon discounted cash flows of estimated costs for site-specific plans. Certain ash basins have had probability weightings applied to them based on different potential closure methods and the probabilities surrounding pending legal changes.\n\nFor further information, see Notes 3, 4 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Commitments and Contingencies\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations.\"\n\n## Long-Lived Asset Impairment Assessments, Excluding Regulated Operations\n\nDuke Energy evaluates property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant change in cash flow projections or the determination that it is more likely than not that an asset or asset group will be sold) indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with their carrying value.\n\nPerforming an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets and developing the undiscounted future cash flows. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. Additionally, determining fair value requires probability weighting future cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. When determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has discrete cash flows.\n\nDuring 2021, Duke Energy evaluated recoverability of certain renewable merchant plants due to changing market pricing and declining long-term forecasted energy prices, primarily driven by lower long-term forecasted natural gas prices, capital cost of new renewables and increased renewable penetration. It was determined the assets were all recoverable as the carrying value of the assets approximated or were less than the aggregate estimated future cash flows. Duke Energy has approximately $200 million and $210 million in Property, plant and equipment related to these assets as of December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n\nWorkplace and workforce realignment has been a focus for the company and costs have been incurred attributable to business transformation, including long-term real estate strategy changes and workforce realignment. For further information, see Notes 2 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Business Segments\" and \"Property, Plant and Equipment.\"\n\n## Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits\n\nThe calculation of pension expense, other post-retirement benefit expense and net pension and other post-retirement assets or liabilities require the use of assumptions and election of permissible accounting alternatives. Changes in assumptions can result in different expense and reported asset or liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Duke Energy believes the most critical assumptions for pension and other post-retirement benefits are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate applied to future projected benefit payments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Assumptions and Accounting Approach\n\nAn impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that asset. The impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds the asset's fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate.\n\n## Carrying Value of Equity Method Investments\n\nNEE  evaluates  its  equity  method  investments  for  impairment  when  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  fair  value  of  the investment is less than the carrying value and the investment may be other-than-temporarily impaired.\n\n## Nature of Accounting Estimates\n\nIndicators of a potential impairment include, but are not limited to, a series of operating losses of an investee, the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment, the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity and a current fair value of an investment that may be less than its carrying value. If indicators of impairment exist, an estimate of the investment's fair value will be calculated. Approaches for estimating  fair  value  include,  among  others,  an  income  approach  using  a  probability-weighted  discounted  cash  flows  model  and  a  market approach using an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple model. The probability assigned to each scenario as well as the cash flows and EBITDA multiple identified are critical in determining fair value.\n\n## Assumptions and Accounting Approach\n\nAn impairment loss is required to be recognized if the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary. Assessment of whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired involves, among other factors, consideration of the length of time that the fair value is below the carrying value, current  expected  performance  relative  to  the  expected  performance  when  the  investment  was  initially  made,  performance  relative  to  peers, industry performance relative to the economy, credit rating, regulatory actions and legal and permitting challenges. If management is unable to reasonably assert that an impairment is temporary or believes that there will not be full recovery of the carrying value of its investment, then the impairment is considered to be other than temporary. Investments that are other-than-temporarily impaired are written down to their estimated fair value and cannot subsequently be written back up for increases in estimated fair value. Impairment losses are recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.\n\n## Decommissioning and Dismantlement\n\nNEE accounts for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations (collectively, AROs) under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. NEE's AROs relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities.\n\n## Nature of Accounting Estimates\n\nThe  calculation  of  the  future  cost  of  retiring  long-lived  assets,  including  nuclear  decommissioning  and  plant  dismantlement  costs,  involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures and making judgments concerning whether or not such costs are considered a legal obligation.  Estimating  the  amount  and  timing  of  future  expenditures  includes,  among  other  things,  making  projections  of  when  assets  will  be retired and ultimately decommissioned and how costs will escalate with inflation. In addition, NEE also makes interest rate and rate of return projections  on  its  investments  in  determining  recommended  funding  requirements  for  nuclear  decommissioning  costs.  Periodically,  NEE  is required to update these estimates and projections which can affect the annual expense amounts recognized, the liabilities recorded and the annual funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. For example, an increase of 0.25% in the assumed escalation rates for nuclear decommissioning costs would increase NEE's AROs at December 31, 2021 by approximately $234 million.\n\n## Assumptions and Accounting Approach\n\nFPL -For ratemaking purposes, FPL accrues and funds for nuclear plant decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit based on studies that are approved by the FPSC. The most recent studies, filed in 2020, reflect, among other things, the expiration dates of the operating licenses for FPL's nuclear units at the time of the studies. FPL's portion of the future cost of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately $10.2 billion, or $2.4 billion expressed in 2021 dollars. The ultimate costs of decommissioning reflect the application submitted to the NRC for the extension of St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 licenses for an additional 20 years.",

For its 2020 and 2019 annual impairment tests, Southern Company Gas performed the qualitative assessment and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of all of its reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying amounts, and therefore no quantitative assessment was required. For its annual impairment tests for PowerSecure, Southern Company performed the quantitative assessment, which resulted in the fair value of goodwill at PowerSecure exceeding its carrying value in all years presented. However, Southern Company recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling $34 million in 2019 as a result of its decision to sell certain PowerSecure business units. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company\" for additional information. The COVID-19 pandemic and the related impacts on the worldwide economy have disrupted supply chains, reduced labor availability and productivity, and reduced economic activity in the United States. These effects have had a variety of adverse impacts on Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including PowerSecure. If these factors continue to negatively affect the operating results of PowerSecure and its businesses, a portion of the associated goodwill of $263 million may become impaired. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\nThe judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can significantly impact the applicable Registrant's results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the various characteristics of the asset, and projected cash flows. As the determination of an asset's fair value and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.\n\nSee Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities\" for additional information regarding the applicable Registrants' goodwill.\n\n## Long-Lived Assets (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)\n\nThe applicable Registrants assess their other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an indicator exists, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the asset carrying value to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset's use and eventual disposition. If the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, the fair value of the asset is determined and a loss is recorded equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset. In addition, when assets are identified as held for sale, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value of the assets or asset group exceeds their fair value less cost to sell. A high degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to these evaluations, which are based on projections of various factors, some of which have been quite volatile in recent years. Impairments of long-lived assets of the traditional electric utilities and natural gas distribution utilities are generally related to specific regulatory disallowances.\n\nSouthern Power's investments in long-lived assets are primarily generation assets. Excluding the natural gas distribution utilities, Southern Company Gas' investments in long-lived assets are primarily natural gas transportation and storage facility assets, whether in service or under construction.\n\nFor Southern Power, examples of impairment indicators could include significant changes in construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, the inability to remarket generating capacity for an extended period, the unplanned termination of a customer contract, or the inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract. For Southern Company Gas, examples of impairment indicators could include, but are not limited to, significant changes in the U.S. natural gas storage market, construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, the inability to renew or extend customer contracts or the inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract, attrition rates, or the inability to deploy a development project.\n\nAs the determination of the expected future cash flows generated from an asset, an asset's fair value, and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, Southern Company recorded impairment charges totaling $7 million ($6 million after tax) and $206 million ($105 million after tax), respectively, related to its leveraged lease investments. During 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded total pre-tax charges of $84 million ($67 million after tax) related to its equity method investment in the PennEast Pipeline project. During 2019, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $91 million ($69 million after-tax) related to a natural gas storage facility and approximately $24 million ($17 million after tax) related to the sale of Pivotal LNG. See Notes 7 and 9 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" and \"Southern Company Leveraged Lease,\" respectively, and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on recent asset impairments.",

NEER recognizes ITCs as a reduction to income tax expense when the related energy property is placed into service. FPL recognizes ITCs as a reduction to income tax expense over the depreciable life of the related energy property . A t December 31, 2024 and 2023, FPL's accumulated deferred ITCs were approximately $966 million and $997 million, respectively , and are included in noncurrent regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. For taxable years beginning after 2022, renewable energy tax credits generated during the taxable  year  can  be  transferred  to  an  unrelated  purchaser  for  cash  and  are  accounted  for  under Accounting  Standards  Codification  740 -Income  T axes . Proceeds resulting from the sales of renewable energy tax credits for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 of approximately $1,304 million and $370 million, respectively , are reported in the cash paid (received) for income taxes - net within the supplemental disclosures of cash flow information on NEE's consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nA valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. NEE recognizes interest income (expense) related to unrecognized tax benefits (liabilities) in interest income and interest expense, respectively , net of the amount deferred at FPL. A t FPL, the offset to accrued interest receivable (payable) on income taxes is classified as a regulatory liability (regulatory asset) which will be amortized to income (expense) over a five-year period upon settlement in accordance with regulatory treatment. A ll tax positions taken by NEE in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not threshold. NEE and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states, the most significant of which is Florida, and certain foreign jurisdictions. Federal tax liabilities, with the exception of certain refund claims, are effectively settled for all years prior to 2019. State and foreign tax liabilities, which have varied statutes of limitations regarding additional assessments, are generally effectively settled for years prior to 2019. A t December 31, 2024, NEE had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $130 million that, if recogniz ed, could impact the annual effective income tax rate. The amounts of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest accruals may change within the next 12 months; however, NEE and FPL do not expect these changes to have a significant impact on NEE's or FPL's financial statements. See Note 5.\n\nNoncontrolling Interests - Noncontrolling interests represent the portions of net assets in consolidated entities that are not owned by NEE and are reported as a component of equity on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. A t December 31, 2024, noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated balance sheets primarily reflects the interests related to differential membership interests discussed below, as well as other noncontrolling interests in certain wind and solar generation and transmission facilities sold to non-affiliated parties and X PLR Infrastructure Partners, LP (X PLR) (formerly NextEra Energy Partners, LP).\n\nCertain subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources have sold Class B noncontrolling membership interests in entities that have ownership interests in wind generation, solar generation and battery storage facilities, with generating/storage capacity in operation or under construction totaling approximately 11,258 M W, 4,084 MW and 1,919 MW, respectively , at December 31, 2024, to third-party investors (differential membership interests). The third-party investors are allocated earnings, tax attributes and cash flows in accordance with the respective limited liability company agreements. Those economics are allocated primarily to the third-party inv estors until they  receiv e a targeted return (the flip date) and thereafter to NEE. NEE has the right to call the third-party  interests at specified amounts if and when the flip date occurs. NEE has determined the allocation of economics between the controlling party and third-party investor should not follow the respective ownership percentages for each wind generation, solar generation and battery storage project but rather the hypothetical liquidation of book value (HLBV) method based on the governing provisions in each respective limited liability company agreement. Under the HLBV  method, the amounts of income and loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest reflects changes in the amount the owners would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the respective liquidation provisions, assuming the net assets of these entities were liquidated at the recorded amounts, after taking into account any capital transactions, such as contributions and distributions, between the entities and the owners. A t the point in time that the third-party investor, in hypothetical liquidation, would achieve its targeted return, NEE attributes the additional hypothetical proceeds to the differential membership interests based on the call price. A loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated statements of income represents earnings attributable to NEE.\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately $9,062 million and $8,857 million, respectively , of noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated balance sheets relates to differential membership interests. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, NEE recorded earnings of approximately $1,329 million, $1,135 million and $987 million, respectively , associated with differential membership interests, which is reflected as net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated statements of income.\n\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests - Certain subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold Class B noncontrolling membership interests in entities that have ownership interests in wind generation, as well as solar and solar plus battery storage facilities to third-party investors. A s specified in the respective limited liability  company agreements, if, subject to certain contingencies, certain events occur, including, among others, those that would delay completion or cancel any of the underlying projects, an investor has the option to require NEER to return all or part of its investment. A s these potential redemptions were outside of NEER's control, these balances were classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. During 2024, the contingencies associated with the December 31, 2023 balance",

The agreements grant Chevron a security interest in the co-generation assets located at the refinery and owned by Mississippi Power, with a lease receivable balance of $139 million at December 31, 2024, that is exercisable upon the occurrence of (i) certain bankruptcy events or (ii) other events of default coupled with specific reductions in steam output at the facility and a downgrade of Mississippi Power's credit rating to below investment grade by two of the three rating agencies. See Note 9 under \"Lessor\" for additional information.\n\nSee Note 8 under \"Long-term Debt\" for information regarding debt secured by certain assets of Georgia Power and Southern Company Gas.\n\n## 6. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\n\nAROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted riskfree rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities. Each traditional electric operating company and natural gas distribution utility has received accounting guidance from its state PSC or applicable state regulatory agency allowing the continued accrual or recovery of other retirement costs for long-lived assets that it does not have a legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations are reflected in the balance sheets as regulatory liabilities and amounts to be recovered are reflected in the balance sheets as regulatory assets.\n\nThe ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally surface impoundments. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle). See \"Nuclear Decommissioning\" herein for additional information. Other significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power. The ARO liability for Southern Power primarily relates to its solar and wind facilities, which are located on long-term land leases requiring the restoration of land at the end of the lease.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the ARO.\n\nSouthern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to recognize in their respective statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs recognized in accordance with accounting standards related to asset retirement and environmental obligations and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability in the balance sheets as ordered by the various state PSCs.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) actively evaluates customer creditworthiness, particularly for large commercial and industrial non-tariff customers, and requires pre-contract assessments to ensure recoverability of incurred costs. Southern Company (SO) emphasizes that its future earnings in natural gas distribution depend partly on customer creditworthiness, indicating a strategic sensitivity to this risk. In contrast, NextEra Energy (NEE) highlights that adverse economic conditions or individual customer circumstances may negatively affect the creditworthiness and performance of its customers, hedging counterparties, and vendors, which could lead to financial losses or operational disruptions. These perspectives show that while all three companies are exposed to customer credit risk, DUK and SO focus more on pre-emptive evaluation and dependency, whereas NEE emphasizes the broader operational and financial risks stemming from potential defaults.",

D uke Energy m anages interest rate exposure by lim iting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by m onitoring the effects of m arket changes in interest rates. D uke E nergy also enters into financial derivative instrum ents, which m ay include instrum ents such as, but not lim ited to, interest rate swaps, swaptions and U .S. T reasury lock agreem ents to manage and m itigate interest rate risk exposure. See N otes 1, 7, 15 and 17 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, 'Sum m ary of Significant Accounting P olicies,' 'D ebt and C redit Facilities,' 'D erivatives and H edging,' and 'F air Value M easurem ents.'\n\nDuke E nergy had $6.6 billion of unhedged long- and short-term  floating interest rate exposure at D ecem ber 31, 2024. T he im pact of a 100-basis point change in interest rates on pretax incom e is approxim ately $70 m illion at D ecem ber 31, 2024. T his am ount was estim ated by considering the im pact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate securities outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges as of D ecem ber 31, 2024.\n\n## Foreign Currency E xchange R isk\n\nDuke E nergy is exposed to risk resulting from  changes in the foreign currency exchange rates as a result of its issuances of long-term  debt denom inated in a foreign currency. D uke Energy m anages foreign currency exchange risk exposure by entering into cross-currency swaps, a type of financial derivative instrum ent, which m itigate foreign currency exchange exposure. See N otes 7, 15 and 17 to the C onsolidated Financial Statem ents, 'D ebt and C redit F acilities,' 'D erivatives and H edging' and 'F air Value M easurem ents,\" respectively.\n\n## Credit R isk\n\nCredit risk represents the loss that the D uke E nergy R egistrants would incur if a counterparty fails to perform  under its contractual obligations. W here exposed to credit risk, the D uke Energy R egistrants analyze the counterparty's financial condition prior to entering into an agreem ent and m onitor exposure on an ongoing basis. T he D uke E nergy R egistrants establish credit lim its where appropriate in the context of contractual arrangem ents and m onitor such lim its.\n\nTo reduce credit exposure, the D uke E nergy R egistrants seek to include netting provisions with counterparties, which perm it the offset of receivables and payables with such counterparties. The D uke E nergy R egistrants also frequently use m aster agreem ents with credit support annexes to further m itigate certain credit exposures. T he m aster agreem ents provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. T he threshold am ount represents a negotiated unsecured credit lim it for each party to the agreem ent, determ ined in accordance with the D uke E nergy R egistrants' internal corporate credit practices and standards. C ollateral agreem ents generally also provide that the failure to post collateral when required is sufficient cause to term inate transactions and liquidate all positions.\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants also obtain cash, letters of credit, or surety bonds from  certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreem ents, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual term s and conditions applicable to each transaction. See N ote 15 to the C onsolidated Financial Statem ents, 'D erivatives and H edging,' for additional inform ation regarding credit risk related to derivative instrum ents.\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants' principal counterparties for its electric and natural gas businesses are R T O s, distribution com panies, m unicipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U .S. E xposure to these entities consists prim arily of am ounts due to D uke E nergy R egistrants for delivered electricity. Additionally, there m ay be potential risks associated with rem arketing of energy and capacity in the event of default by wholesale power custom ers. The D uke E nergy R egistrants have concentrations of receivables from certain of such entities that m ay affect the D uke E nergy R egistrants' credit risk.\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants are also subject to credit risk from  transactions with their suppliers that involve prepaym ents or m ilestone paym ents in conjunction with outsourcing arrangem ents, m ajor construction projects and certain com m odity purchases. T he D uke E nergy R egistrants' credit exposure to such suppliers m ay take the form  of increased costs or project delays in the event of nonperform ance. T he D uke E nergy R egistrants' frequently require guarantees or letters of credit from  suppliers to m itigate this credit risk.\n\nCredit risk associated with the D uke E nergy R egistrants' service to residential, com m ercial and industrial custom ers is generally lim ited to outstanding accounts receivable. T he D uke Energy R egistrants m itigate this credit risk by requiring tariff custom ers to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit or surety bond until a satisfactory paym ent history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction at which tim e the deposit is typically refunded. C harge-offs for retail custom ers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the D uke E nergy R egistrants and are typically recovered through retail rates. M anagem ent continually m onitors custom er charge-offs, paym ent patterns and the im pact of current econom ic conditions on custom ers' ability to pay their outstanding balance to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves.\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants provide certain non-tariff services, prim arily to large com m ercial and industrial custom ers in which incurred costs, including invested capital, are intended to be recovered from  the individual custom er and therefore are not subject to rate recovery in the event of custom er default. C ustom er creditworthiness is assessed prior to entering into these transactions. C redit concentration related to these transactions exists for certain of these custom ers.\n\nDuke E nergy C arolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and dam ages above an aggregate self-insured retention. See N ote 5 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, \"C om m itm ents and C ontingencies\" for inform ation on asbestos-related injuries and dam ages claim s.\n\nThe Duke E nergy R egistrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of perform ance and financial guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties.

Liquidity in energy markets can be described as the degree to which a product, such as electricity , gas or transmission rights, can be quickly bought or sold without significantly affecting its price and without incurring significant transaction costs. It can be driven in part by the number of active market participants and is an important factor in NEE's ability to manage risks in its participation in these markets. Liquidity in the energy markets can be adversely affected by price volatility , restrictions on the availability  of credit, inflation, rising interest rates and other factors, and any  reduction in the liquidity  of energy  markets could have a material adverse effect on NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n## NEE's and F PL's hedging and trading procedures and associated risk management tools may not protect against significant losses.\n\nNEE and FPL have hedging and trading procedures and associated risk management tools, such as separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms.

These factors include the natural gas distribution utilities' ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs, including those related to projected long-term demand growth, safety, system reliability and resiliency, natural gas, and capital ex penditures, including ex panding and improving the natural gas distribution systems; the completion and subsequent operation of ongoing infrastructure and other construction projects; customer creditworthiness; and certain policies to limit the use of natural gas, such as the potential in Illinois and across certain other parts of the United States for state or municipal bans on the use of natural gas or policies designed to promote electrification. The volatility of natural gas prices has an impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, its long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services business to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices, primarily driven by tight gas supplies, geopolitical events, and diminished gas production, subject a portion of Southern Company Gas' operations to earnings variability and may result in higher natural gas prices. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment. The demand for natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis. Alternatively, a significant drop in oil and natural gas prices could lead to a consolidation of natural gas producers or reduced levels of natural gas production.\n\nEarnings for both the electricity and natural gas businesses are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather; competition; developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with wholesale customers; demand growth in data centers; customer energy conservation practices; the use of alternative energy sources by customers; government incentives to reduce overall energy usage; fuel, labor, and material prices in an environment of heightened inflation and material and labor supply chain disruptions; and the price elasticity of demand. Demand for electricity and natural gas in the Registrants' service territories is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth or decline that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.\n\nMississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 13.9% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2024. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Mississippi Power - Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff\" for information on a rate settlement related to Mississippi Power's contract with Cooperative Energy through the end of 2035, subject to approval by the FERC.\n\nAs part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, disposition of, or the sale of interests in, certain assets or businesses, internal restructuring, or some combination thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial condition of Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power and Southern Company Gas regularly consider and evaluate joint development arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets as part of their business strategies. See Note 15 to the financial statements and \"Construction Programs\" herein for additional information.\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\nThe Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, avian and other wildlife and habitat protection, and other natural resources. The Southern Company system maintains comprehensive environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess both current and upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. New or revised environmental laws and regulations could further affect many areas of operations for the Subsidiary Registrants. The costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, may impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions (which are generally subject to approval from the traditional electric operating companies' respective state PSCs), results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit extensions or retirements and replacements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. A major portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through retail and wholesale rates, including existing ratemaking and billing provisions. The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein cannot be determined at this time and will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and",

      "answer": "Duke Energy is actively engaged in the NRC's subsequent license renewal (SLR) process for the Oconee Nuclear Station, having submitted a supplement to its environmental report addressing impacts during the SLR period and is awaiting the final environmental impact statement expected in August 2024. NextEra Energy operates nuclear facilities that are subject to NRC jurisdiction and must comply with its regulations, including environmental and safety standards, and participates in regulatory discussions to anticipate and influence potential changes. Southern Company, through its subsidiaries Alabama Power and Georgia Power, complies with NRC requirements by maintaining external trust funds for decommissioning nuclear plants, which are managed under strict investment guidelines and are subject to oversight by multiple regulatory bodies. Each company demonstrates a different dimension of NRC regulation: Duke focuses on license extension and environmental compliance, NextEra on operational and environmental regulation, and Southern on long-term financial planning for decommissioning.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each reflect their respective financial or operational dependencies on Florida, and what does this reveal about their regional exposure and strategic positioning in the state's utility market?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) shows minimal direct financial exposure to Florida through its post-retirement benefit costs, with only $3 million in net periodic post-retirement benefit costs attributed to Duke Energy Florida in 2020. NextEra Energy (NEE) has significant operational exposure in Florida through its ownership of major energy infrastructure assets such as St. Lucie Unit No. 2 and Daniel Units Nos. 1 and 2, with gross investments of $2,284 million and $759 million respectively as of December 31, 2021. Southern Company (SO) reflects a tax-related dependency on Florida through its net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards, with $10 million in approximate net state income tax benefit tied to Florida NOLs that begin expiring in 2034. Together, these perspectives indicate that while DUK has limited financial ties to Florida, NEE maintains substantial operational assets in the state, and SO has a modest but long-term tax benefit tied to the state, suggesting varied strategic positioning in Florida's utility landscape.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Florida: Duke Energy Florida reported $3 million in net periodic post-retirement benefit costs in 2020, indicating minimal financial exposure to Florida-specific pension obligations.",
        "Hop 2: NEE \u2192 Florida: NextEra Energy has major operational assets in Florida, including St. Lucie Unit No. 2 with a gross investment of $2,284 million and Daniel Units Nos. 1 and 2 with $759 million in gross investment as of December 31, 2021.",
        "Hop 3: SO \u2192 Florida: Southern Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company, has $10 million in approximate net state income tax benefit tied to Florida NOLs that begin expiring in 2034, indicating a long-term but limited financial dependency on the state."

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each approach the issuance and disclosure of First Mortgage Bonds, and what does this reveal about their differing capital structure strategies in 2022?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) disclosed $29.177 billion in First Mortgage Bonds with a weighted average interest rate of 4.00%, indicating a significant portion of secured debt in its capital structure. NextEra Energy (NEE) included First Mortgage Bonds among a broad range of securities under its shelf registration, signaling a flexible and potentially opportunistic approach to debt issuance. Southern Company (SO) reported $2.1 billion in First Mortgage Bonds at a weighted average interest rate of 3.53%, a much smaller proportion of its overall long-term debt, suggesting a more conservative reliance on this form of financing. Together, these disclosures reveal that while all three utilities use First Mortgage Bonds, they differ in scale and strategic emphasis, with Duke Energy relying heavily on them, Southern Company using them sparingly, and NextEra Energy maintaining the option to issue them as part of a broader capital markets strategy.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each quantify or describe the impact of weather conditions on their 2023 financial or operational performance, and what does this reveal about their exposure to climate variability in the utilities sector?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) reported that unfavorable weather was a partial offset to its 2023 financial performance, impacting net income. NextEra Energy (NEE) emphasized its operational dependence on weather, noting that severe weather events can significantly disrupt service, increase costs, and affect generation output, especially for wind and solar facilities. Southern Company (SO) used weather-adjusted KWH sales to assess performance, showing a weather-adjusted residential sales decline of 0.4% and a 1.2% increase in weather-adjusted commercial sales. Together, these perspectives highlight how each utility experiences and manages the financial and operational risks associated with weather variability, with NEE particularly exposed due to its reliance on weather-dependent renewables, while SO uses statistical modeling to isolate weather effects, and DUK experiences direct financial drag from unfavorable conditions.",

        "Hop 3: SO \u2192 Weather Conditions: SO used 'weather-adjusted KWH sales' to evaluate performance, showing a 0.4% decrease in weather-adjusted residential sales and a 1.2% increase in commercial sales, indicating efforts to isolate and manage weather-induced volatility."

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) references the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the context of regulatory and policy frameworks impacting its operations, indicating its alignment with federal energy legislation. NextEra Energy (NEE) provides detailed insight into how the IRA expands tax incentives for renewable energy projects, including the extension of the 100% Production Tax Credit (PTC) and 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for wind and solar facilities, as well as the inclusion of storage and green hydrogen projects under the ITC. Southern Company (SO) includes the IRA in its glossary of regulatory and legislative terms, indicating its relevance to the company's strategic planning and compliance framework. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies recognize the IRA as a key regulatory driver, NEE is most explicit in leveraging its provisions for clean energy expansion, whereas DUK and SO frame it more generally within policy and compliance contexts.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy issued $1.1 billion in first mortgage bonds in January 2025, using the proceeds to repay short-term debt and an accounts receivable securitization facility. Southern Company had $2.775 billion in outstanding first mortgage bonds as of December 31, 2024, indicating active use of this instrument. NextEra Energy, while not currently issuing first mortgage bonds, filed a shelf registration in March 2024 that allows for their potential future issuance. This shows Duke and Southern are actively utilizing first mortgage bonds for refinancing and capital needs, while NextEra is positioning itself for possible future use depending on market conditions.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each approach the management of commodity price risk within their broader risk management policies, and what does this reveal about their respective strategies in mitigating exposure to energy market volatility?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) employs comprehensive risk management policies that include the use of commodity derivatives such as swaps, futures, forwards, and options to hedge against exposure to electricity, coal, and natural gas price fluctuations. It also manages basis risk through congestion hedge products like financial transmission rights in PJM and MISO. Most of these instruments are undesignated contracts, with mark-to-market changes reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities. NextEra Energy (NEE) similarly utilizes derivative instruments to manage physical and financial risks in fuel and electricity purchases and sales, with a focus on optimizing the value of its generation and production assets. NEE\u2019s risk management policies are designed to measure market risk as the potential loss from hypothetical changes in commodity prices, interest rates, or equity prices over the next year. Southern Company (SO) also uses swaps, options, futures, and forwards to manage commodity exposures, but highlights the risk of financial losses due to volatility in derivative contract values and potential counterparty failure. SO emphasizes that while risk management policies and limits are in place, they may not fully eliminate risks, and derivative contracts might not always offset the underlying exposure as expected. Collectively, these approaches show a shared reliance on derivatives for risk mitigation, but with varying degrees of emphasis on regulatory alignment, asset optimization, and counterparty risk.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Risk Management Policies: Duke Energy uses commodity derivatives and congestion hedge products (e.g., financial transmission rights in PJM and MISO) to manage exposure to electricity, coal, and natural gas price fluctuations. Most instruments are undesignated, with mark-to-market changes reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities.",
        "Hop 2: NEE \u2192 Risk Management Policies: NextEra Energy uses derivatives to manage risks in fuel and electricity purchases and sales, measuring market risk based on hypothetical changes in commodity prices over the next year. NEER also engages in marketing and trading to optimize asset value.",
        "Hop 3: SO \u2192 Risk Management Policies: Southern Company uses derivatives to manage commodity exposures but highlights the risk of financial losses due to volatility and potential counterparty failure. It acknowledges that hedging may not fully offset exposure and that valuation estimates can affect reported income."

E nterprise R isk Managem ent includes m arket risk as part of the financial and transaction related risks in its fram ework.\n\nDuke E nergy is exposed to m arket risks associated with com m odity prices, interest rates and equity prices. D uke E nergy has established com prehensive risk m anagem ent policies to monitor and m anage these m arket risks. D uke E nergy's C hief E xecutive O fficer and C hief F inancial O fficer are responsible for the overall approval of m arket risk m anagem ent policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. T he F inance and R isk M anagem ent C om m ittee of the Board of D irectors receives periodic updates from  the C hief R isk O fficer and other m em bers of m anagem ent on m arket risk positions, corporate exposures and overall risk m anagem ent activities. T he C hief R isk O fficer is responsible for the overall governance of m anaging com m odity price risk, including m onitoring exposure lim its.\n\nThe following disclosures about m arket risk contain forward-looking statem ents that involve estim ates, projections, goals, forecasts, assum ptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcom es to differ m aterially from  those expressed in the forward-looking statem ents. See Item  1A, 'R isk F actors,' and 'C autionary Statem ent R egarding Forward-Looking Inform ation' for a discussion of the factors that m ay im pact any such forward-looking statem ents m ade herein.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nPrice risk represents the potential risk of loss from  adverse changes in the m arket price of electricity or other energy com m odities. D uke E nergy's exposure to com m odity price risk is influenced by a num ber of factors, including the effects of regulation, com m odity contract size and length, m arket liquidity, m arket conditions, location and unique or specific contract term s. D uke E nergy is exposed to the im pact of m arket fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products m arketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy-related assets.\n\nDuke E nergy's exposure to these fluctuations through its regulated utility operations is lim ited since these operations are subject to cost-based regulation and are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through various cost recovery clauses, including fuel clauses, form ula-based contracts, or other cost-sharing m echanism s. W hile there m ay be a delay in tim ing between when these costs are incurred and when they are recovered through rates, changes from  year to year generally do not have a m aterial im pact on operating results of these regulated operations.\n\nDuke E nergy em ploys established policies and procedures to m anage risks associated with these m arket fluctuations, which m ay include using various com m odity derivatives, such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. For additional inform ation, see N ote 15 to the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents, 'D erivatives and H edging.'\n\n## Generation Portfolio R isks\n\nFor the E U &amp;I  segm ent, the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operations or com m itted load is subject to com m odity price fluctuations. H owever, the im pact on the Consolidated Statem ents of O perations is lim ited due to m echanism s in these regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of m ost of the net profits from  these activities with retail custom ers.\n\n## Hedging Strategies\n\nDuke E nergy m onitors risks associated with com m odity price changes on its future operations and, where appropriate, uses various com m odity instrum ents such as electricity, coal and natural gas hedging contracts and options to m itigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations. D uke E nergy's prim ary use of energy com m odity derivatives is to hedge against exposure to the prices of power, fuel for generation and natural gas for custom ers.\n\nDuke E nergy also m anages its exposure to basis risk through the use of congestion hedge products in R TO s such as financial transm ission rights (P JM  and M ISO ), which result in paym ents based on differentials in locational m arginal prices. T he m ajority of instrum ents used to m anage D uke E nergy's com m odity price exposure are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instrum ents are referred to as undesignated contracts. M ark-to-m arket changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nDuke E nergy m ay also enter into other contracts that qualify for the N P N S exception. W hen a contract m eets the criteria to qualify as N P N S, D uke E nergy applies such exception. I ncom e recognition and realization related to N P N S contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of the com m odity. F or contracts qualifying for the N P N S exception, no recognition of the contract's fair value in the C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents is required until settlem ent of the contract as long as the transaction rem ains probable of occurring.",

If NEE's rate-regulated entities, primarily FPL, were no longer subject to cost-based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the regulators, including the FPSC for FPL, have the authority to disallow recovery of costs that they consider excessive or imprudently incurred. Such costs may include, among others, fuel and O&amp;M  expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when generation facilities  are  unav ailable,  storm  restoration  costs  and  costs  associated  with  the  construction  or  acquisition  of  new  facilities.  The  continued  applicability   of regulatory accounting is assessed at each reporting period.\n\n## ENERGY MARKETING AND TRADING AND MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY\n\nNEE and FPL are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. Financial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of NEE and FPL described below are held primarily for purposes other than trading. M arket risk is measured as the potential loss in fair v alue resulting from hy pothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices, interest rates or equity prices over the next year. M anagement has established risk management policies to monitor and manage such market risks, as well as credit risks.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nNEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity . In addition, NEE, through NEER, uses derivatives to optimize the value of its power generation and natural gas and oil production assets and engages in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements. See Critical A ccounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging A ctivities and Note 3.\n\nDuring 2023 and 2024, the changes in the fair value of NEE's consolidated subsidiaries' energy contract derivative instruments were as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## The Registrants are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs.\n\nThe financial condition of some insurance companies, actual or threatened physical or cyber attacks, natural disasters, and an increased focus on climate issues, among other things, could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. The availability of insurance may decrease, and the insurance that the Registrants are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms. Further, the insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred.\n\n## The use of derivative contracts by Southern Company and its subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in financial losses that negatively impact the net income of the Registrants or in reported net income volatility.\n\nSouthern Company and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards, to manage their commodity and interest rate exposures and, to a lesser extent, manage weather and foreign currency exchange rate exposure and engage in limited trading activities. The Registrants could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. These risks are managed through risk management policies, limits, and procedures, which might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with these activities. In addition, derivative contracts entered into for hedging purposes might not offset the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in financial losses. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. The factors used in the valuation of these instruments become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable further into the future. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.\n\nSee Notes 13 and 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## Future impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' results of operations.\n\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or on an interim basis if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. If impairment testing indicates that the carrying amount of reporting units exceeds the respective fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized. If goodwill were to become impaired, the results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. At December 31, 2024, goodwill was $5.2 billion and $5.0 billion for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas, respectively.\n\nIn addition, Southern Company and its subsidiaries have long-lived assets recorded on their balance sheets. Long-lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. If impairment testing indicates that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets exceeds the respective fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized. See Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for information regarding certain impairment charges at Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Southern Company Gas.\n\n## Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 1C. CYBERSECURITY.\n\nCybersecurity is a critical component of Southern Company's risk management program. The Southern Company system has implemented a cybersecurity program to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats that may result in material adverse effects on the Southern Company system's ability to fulfill critical business functions, including energy delivery service failures, and on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Southern Company system's information systems.\n\n## Governance and Oversight of Cybersecurity Risk\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe Southern Company Board of Directors (Board), along with certain committees (primarily the Audit Committee of the Board) oversees the Southern Company system's enterprise risk management process. The Board devotes significant time and attention to overseeing cybersecurity risk, and the Southern Company system's approach to cybersecurity governance establishes oversight throughout the enterprise. The Board has delegated the primary responsibility to oversee cybersecurity matters to the Business Security and Resiliency Committee (BSRC) of the Board. Having a committee like the BSRC, focused on and dedicated to security, is a strong governance practice. Comprised solely of independent members of the Board, the BSRC is charged with oversight of risks related to cybersecurity, physical security, and operational resiliency. The BSRC includes directors with an understanding of cyber issues. The BSRC meets at every regular Board meeting and when needed in",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) indicates that the recovery period for regulatory assets and liabilities varies or has not been determined, with some costs being recovered over the life of the associated assets or the remaining service periods of employees covered by benefit plans. NextEra Energy (NEE) highlights that for its rate-regulated operations, including Florida Power & Light, there are timing differences in the recognition of legal asset retirement costs due to regulatory recovery methods, particularly related to nuclear decommissioning and renewable facility dismantlement. Southern Company (SO) emphasizes the complexity and judgment involved in determining whether incurred costs will be recovered in future rates, subject to regulatory orders, and notes the high degree of subjectivity in assessing the impact of future regulatory decisions on asset and liability balances. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies are subject to rate regulation, they face distinct challenges and risk exposures: DUK deals with uncertainty in recovery timing, NEE faces long-term obligations tied to infrastructure and decommissioning, and SO grapples with regulatory unpredictability and audit complexity in asset/liability recognition.",

        "Hop 3: SO \u2192 Rate Regulation: SO identifies the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter, noting the significant management judgments required to determine whether incurred costs will be recovered in future rates or result in customer refunds, with high subjectivity in assessing future regulatory outcomes."

Southern Company (SO) follows GAAP-compliant regulatory accounting practices under the oversight of the FERC and various state PSCs, reflecting the effects of rate regulation across its subsidiaries. Each company demonstrates a distinct regulatory exposure: DUK emphasizes regulatory asset risk, NEE focuses on long-term AROs under rate-regulated frameworks, and SO aligns its broad portfolio with evolving regulatory standards.

          "chunk_text": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the shareholder and the Board of Directors of Duke Energy Ohio, Inc.\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Regulatory Matters - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and by the Kentucky Public Service Commission (collectively the 'Commissions'), which have jurisdiction with respect to the electric and gas rates of the Company. Management has determined it meets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant judgment can be required to determine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has approximately $707 million recorded as regulatory assets.\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation related to regulatory assets as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management, including assumptions regarding the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, to support its assertions on the likelihood of future recovery for deferred costs. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the ratemaking process due to its inherent complexities as it relates to regulatory assets.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the recovery of regulatory assets included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of recovery in future rates and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates.\n- We evaluated the Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n- We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management's recorded balances for completeness.\n- For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company's and intervenors' filings with the Commissions, that may impact the Company's future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n## 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, these businesses also included wholesale gas services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. See Note 15 for information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04.\n\nThe Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. While no material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each approach their investment in or disclosure around solar facilities, and what does this reveal about their differing strategies in scaling renewable energy infrastructure?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) is investing in 10 new solar facilities in Florida with a combined capacity of approximately 750 MW, at an estimated cost of $1 billion over three years. These investments are part of a voluntary solar program approved by the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC), though the program faces legal appeal. NextEra Energy (NEE) consolidates eight VIEs that own and operate solar facilities with a total production capability of approximately 772 MW, and it has expanded its consolidated VIE assets from $751 million in 2020 to $1.851 billion in 2021. Southern Company (SO) invests in solar facilities through Southern Power and Georgia Power, and as of 2021, holds approximately $1.2 billion in unutilized federal Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) and Production Tax Credits (PTCs), which are expected to be fully utilized by 2024. These companies demonstrate different strategies: Duke focuses on customer-driven solar programs with regulatory support, NextEra leverages VIE structures to scale solar output and manage third-party financing, and Southern Company capitalizes on federal tax incentives to drive investment in renewable infrastructure.",

          "chunk_text": "## Storm Restoration Cost Recovery\n\nDuke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on April 30, 2019, to recover $223 million of estimated retail incremental storm restoration costs for Hurricane Michael, consistent with the provisions in the 2017 Settlement, and the FPSC approved the petition on June 11, 2019. The FPSC also approved allowing Duke Energy Florida to use the tax savings resulting from the Tax Act to recover these storm costs in lieu of implementing a storm surcharge. Approved storm costs were fully recovered by year-end 2021. On November 22, 2019, Duke Energy Florida filed a petition for approval of actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Michael in the amount of $191 million plus interest. On May 19, 2020, Duke Energy Florida filed a supplemental true up reducing the actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Michael by approximately $3 million, resulting in a total request to recover $188 million actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs, plus interest. Approximately $80 million of these costs are included in Regulatory assets within Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020.\n\nDuke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on December 19, 2019, to recover $169 million of estimated retail incremental storm restoration costs for Hurricane Dorian, consistent with the provisions in the 2017 Settlement and the FPSC approved the petition on February 24, 2020. The final actual amount of $145 million was filed on September 30, 2020. The 2021 Settlement resolved all matters regarding storm cost recovery relating to Hurricane Michael and Hurricane Dorian.\n\n## Clean Energy Connection\n\nOn July 1, 2020, Duke Energy Florida petitioned the FPSC for approval of a voluntary solar program. The program consists of 10 new solar generating facilities with combined capacity of approximately 750 MW. The program allows participants to support cost-effective solar development in Florida by paying a subscription fee based on per kilowatt-subscriptions and receiving a credit on their bill based on the actual generation associated with their portion of the solar portfolio. The estimated cost of the 10 new solar generation facilities is approximately $1 billion over the next three years, and this investment will be included in base rates offset by the revenue from the subscription fees. The credits will be included for recovery in the fuel cost recovery clause. The FPSC approved the program in January 2021.\n\nOn February 24, 2021, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) filed a notice of appeal of the FPSC's order approving the Clean Energy Connection to the Supreme Court of Florida. LULAC's initial brief was filed on May 26, 2021, and Appellees' response briefs were filed on July 26, 2021. LULAC's reply brief was filed on September 24, 2021, and its request for oral argument was filed on September 28, 2021. The Supreme Court of Florida heard the oral argument on February 9, 2022. The FPSC approval order remains in effect pending the outcome of the appeal. Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the outcome of this matter.",

The difference for both years is net of an approximately $1.5 billion impairment charge  in  2020  related  to  NextEra  Energy  Resources'  investment  in  Mountain  Valley  Pipeline.  In  the  first  quarter  of  2022,  NextEra  Energy  Resources  recorded  an  additional impairment  charge  to  completely  write  off  its  investment  in  Mountain  Valley  Pipeline.  See  Note  4  -  Nonrecurring  Fair  Value  Measurements  for  a  discussion  of  the  impairment charges.\n\nNextEra  Energy  Resources  provides  operational,  management  and  administrative  services  as  well  as  transportation  and  fuel  management services to NEP and its subsidiaries under various agreements (service agreements). NextEra Energy Resources is also party to a cash sweep and credit support (CSCS) agreement with a subsidiary of NEP. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the cash sweep amounts (due to NEP and its subsidiaries)  held  in  accounts  belonging  to  NextEra  Energy  Resources  or  its  subsidiaries  were  approximately  $57  million  and  $10  million, respectively,  and  are  included  in  accounts  payable.  Fee  income  related  to  the  CSCS  agreement  and  the  service  agreements  totaled approximately $148 million, $120 million and $101 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is included in operating revenues in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Amounts due from NEP of approximately $113 million and $68 million are included  in  other  receivables  and  $40  million  and  $32  million  are  included  in  noncurrent  other  assets  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020, respectively.  See  also  Note  1  -  Disposal  of  Businesses/Assets  and  Sale  of  Noncontrolling  Ownership  Interests  for  amounts  due  to  NEP  for reimbursement of construction-related costs. NEECH or NextEra Energy Resources guaranteed or provided indemnifications, letters of credit or surety bonds totaling approximately $3,778 million at December 31, 2021 primarily related to obligations on behalf of NEP's subsidiaries with maturity  dates  ranging  from  2022  to  2059,  including  certain  project  performance  obligations,  obligations  under  financing  and  interconnection agreements and obligations, primarily incurred and future construction payables, associated with the December 2021 sale of projects to NEP (see Note 1 - Disposal of Businesses/Assets and Sale of Noncontrolling Ownership Interests). Payment guarantees and related contracts with respect to unconsolidated entities for which NEE or one of its subsidiaries are the guarantor are recorded on NEE's consolidated balance sheets at fair value. At December 31, 2021, approximately $41 million related to the fair value of the credit support provided under the CSCS agreement is recorded as noncurrent other liabilities on NEE's consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## 9. Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)\n\nNEER - At  December 31, 2021, NEE consolidates a number of VIEs within the NEER segment. Subsidiaries within the NEER segment are considered  the  primary  beneficiary  of  these  VIEs  since  they  control  the  most  significant  activities  of  these  VIEs,  including  operations  and maintenance, and they have the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs.\n\nEight indirect subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources have an ownership interest ranging from approximately 50% to 67% in entities which own and operate solar facilities with the capability of producing a total of approximately 772 MW. Each of the subsidiaries is considered a VIE since the non-managing members have no substantive rights over the managing members, and is consolidated by NextEra Energy Resources. These entities sell their electric output to third parties under power sales contracts with expiration dates ranging from 2035 through 2052. These entities have third-party debt which is secured by liens against the assets of the entities. The debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of NextEra Energy Resources for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of these VIEs were approximately $1,851 million and $1,258 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. There were three of these consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2020, and the assets and liabilities of those VIEs at such date totaled approximately $751 million and $607 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the assets and liabilities of these VIEs consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment and long-term debt.\n\nNEE consolidates a NEET VIE that is constructing an approximately 280-mile electricity transmission line. A  NEET subsidiary is  the  primary beneficiary  and  controls  the  most  significant  activities  during  the  construction  period,  including  controlling  the  construction  budget.  NEET  is entitled to receive 50% of the profits and losses of the entity. The assets and liabilities of the VIE totaled approximately $614 million and $64 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021, and $423 million and $68 million,",

NextEra Energy (NEE) applies cost recovery clauses to fully recover fuel, purchased power, and interchange expenses, with a structured amortization of regulatory assets over periods ranging from 12 to 21 months, and ensures cost-revenue matching by deferring under- or over-recoveries. Southern Company (SO) relies on cost recovery clauses for fuel and purchased gas costs but faces potential delays or disallowances if costs are deemed imprudent, and notes that natural gas price volatility could impact its financials despite regulatory recovery mechanisms. Collectively, these approaches show that while all three companies depend on cost recovery clauses, they differ in implementation timing, regulatory asset amortization schedules, and exposure management to commodity price swings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Cost Recovery Clauses: DUK mentions that natural gas costs are eligible for recovery through cost recovery clauses, which are subject to prudence reviews by state commissions. It also references specific mechanisms like IMR, ARM, and CEP Rider for capital cost recovery.",
        "Hop 2: NEE \u2192 Cost Recovery Clauses: NEE states that cost recovery clauses allow full recovery of fuel, purchased power, and interchange expenses, with regulatory assets amortized over periods ranging from 12 to 21 months. It also defers under- or over-recoveries to match costs with revenues.",
        "Hop 3: SO \u2192 Cost Recovery Clauses: SO notes that while it is generally authorized to recover fuel and gas costs via cost recovery clauses, recovery may be delayed or denied if deemed imprudent, and highlights the volatility of natural gas prices and its potential financial impact."

A significant com petitive factor is price. G U &amp;I 's prim ary product com petition is with electricity for space heating, water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of natural gas or decreases in the price of other energy sources could negatively im pact com petitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consum er. In the case of industrial custom ers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse econom ic or m arket conditions, including higher natural gas costs, could cause these custom ers to suspend business operations or to use alternative sources of energy in favor of energy sources with lower per-unit costs.\n\nHigher natural gas costs or decreases in the price of other energy sources m ay allow com petition from  alternative energy sources for applications that have traditionally used natural gas, encouraging som e custom ers to m ove away from  natural gas-fired equipm ent to equipm ent fueled by other energy sources. C om petition between natural gas and other form s of energy is also based on efficiency, perform ance, reliability, safety and other non-price factors. T echnological im provem ents in other energy sources and events that im pair the public perception of the non-price attributes of natural gas could erode G U &amp;I's com petitive advantage. T hese factors in turn could decrease the dem and for natural gas, im pair G U &amp;I's ability to attract new custom ers and cause existing custom ers to switch to other form s of energy or to bypass G U &amp;I's system s in favor of alternative com petitive sources. T his could result in slow or no custom er growth for G U &amp;I and could cause custom ers to reduce or cease using natural gas, thereby reducing G U &amp;I's ability to m ake capital expenditures and otherwise grow its business, adversely affecting its earnings.\n\n## Natural Gas Investments\n\nDuke E nergy, through its G U &amp;I segm ent, has a 7.5% equity ownership interest in Sabal T rail. Sabal T rail is a joint venture that owns the Sabal T rail N atural G as P ipeline, which is regulated by FE R C  and traverses Alabam a, G eorgia, and F lorida to transport natural gas to F lorida.

T he state utility com m issions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of G U &amp;I's natural gas distribution facilities. C P C N s issued by the state utility com m issions or other governm ent agencies, as applicable, authorize GU&amp;I to construct and operate its natural gas distribution facilities and to sell natural gas to retail and wholesale custom ers. P rior approval from  the relevant state utility com m ission is required for G U &amp;I to issue securities. T he underlying concept of utility ratem aking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity.\n\nI n addition to am ounts collected from  custom ers through approved base rates, each of the state utility com m issions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective com m ission determ ines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over- or under-recovered costs, are prudent.\n\nNatural gas costs are eligible for recovery by G U &amp;I. D ue to the associated regulatory treatm ent and the m ethod allowed for recovery, changes in natural gas costs from  year to year have no m aterial im pact on operating results of G U &amp;I, unless a com m ission finds a portion of such costs to have been im prudent.

The market prices for these commodities may fluctuate significantly over relatively short periods of time as a result of changes in supply and/or demand, which could increase the expenses and/or reduce the revenues of the Registrants. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas' regulated gas distribution operations, such impacts may not be fully recoverable through rates.\n\nSouthern Power and the traditional electric operating companies purchase natural gas as a fuel source for their power generation needs and the natural gas distribution utilities purchase natural gas for sale to their customers. Accordingly, the price of natural gas affects, among other things, Southern Power's and the traditional electric operating companies' costs of generation and the natural gas distribution utilities' cost of natural gas. Natural gas remains a volatile commodity. Slight supply and demand imbalances can quickly result in significant price moves both up and down. These price movements may be short-lived, but the impacts can be pronounced. Natural gas supplies have continued to grow; however, this growth has been accompanied by LNG export growth. Forward curves project prices will remain in the mid- to high-$3 per mmBtu range through 2030; however, short-term price volatility is expected and future prices could be materially impacted by various factors, including unexpected geopolitical events as well as government policies related to natural gas and energy, including infrastructure development, production, and exports.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas from time to time have experienced and may continue to experience underrecovered fuel and purchased power and/or purchased gas cost balances. While the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas are generally authorized to recover fuel and purchased power and/or purchased gas costs through cost recovery clauses, recovery may be delayed or may be denied if costs are deemed to be imprudently incurred.\n\n## The Registrants are subject to risks associated with a changing economic environment, customer behaviors, including increased energy conservation, and adoption patterns of technologies by customers.\n\nThe consumption and use of energy are linked to economic activity. This relationship is affected over time by changes in the economy, customer behaviors, and technologies. An economic downturn could be caused by a variety of factors, including wars, geopolitical instability, acts of terrorism, political or financial crises, pandemic health events, or cyclical economic factors. Any economic downturn could negatively impact customer growth and usage per customer. Additionally, any economic downturn or disruption of financial markets, both nationally and internationally, could negatively affect the financial stability of customers and counterparties of the Subsidiary Registrants.\n\nOutside of economic disruptions, changes in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs, changing conditions and preferences, legislation, or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the relationship of economic activity to the consumption of energy. For example, some jurisdictions in the United States have banned the use of natural gas in new construction.\n\nBoth federal and state programs exist to influence how customers use energy, and several of the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates to promote energy efficiency.\n\nCustomers could also voluntarily reduce their consumption of energy in response to decreases in their disposable income, increases in energy prices, or individual conservation efforts.\n\nIn addition, the adoption of technology by customers can have both positive and negative impacts on sales. Many new technologies utilize less energy than in the past. However, electric and natural gas technologies such as data centers and electric and natural gas vehicles can create additional demand. Given that these technologies are rapidly evolving, the extent of any additional demand is uncertain. The Southern Company system seeks to incorporate the effects of changes in customer behavior, state and federal programs, state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency mandates, and technology, but the Southern Company system's planning processes may not accurately estimate and incorporate these effects.\n\n## The operating results of the Registrants are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal basis. In addition, catastrophic events could result in substantial damage to or limit the operation of the properties of a Subsidiary Registrant.\n\nElectric power and natural gas supply are generally seasonal businesses. The Subsidiary Registrants have historically sold less power and natural gas when weather conditions are milder.\n\nVolatile or significant weather events could result in substantial damage to the transmission and distribution lines of the traditional electric operating companies, the generating facilities of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, and the natural gas distribution and underground storage facilities of Southern Company Gas, which is likely to negatively impact revenue. The Subsidiary Registrants have significant investments in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions and Southern Power and Southern Company Gas have investments in various states that could be subject to severe weather and",

See \"Nuclear Decommissioning\" herein for additional information.\n\nIn November 2024, Georgia Power recorded a net increase of approximately $60 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule resulting from changes in estimates, including higher future inflation rates and the timing of closure activities.\n\nThe cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information at December 31, 2024 using various assumptions related to closure and postclosure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to these assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. The cost estimates for Alabama Power are based on closure-in-place for all surface impoundments. The cost estimates for Georgia Power and Mississippi Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place for some surface impoundments and closure by removal for others. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Note 3 under \"General Litigation Matters - Alabama Power\" for additional information.\n\n## Nuclear Decommissioning\n\nThe NRC requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have external trust funds (Funds) to comply with the NRC's regulations. Use of the Funds is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities. The Funds are managed and invested in accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC, and state PSCs, as well as the IRS. While Alabama Power and Georgia Power are allowed to prescribe an overall investment policy to the Funds' managers,",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nNEE's  and  FPL's  provision  for  income  taxes  and  reporting  of  tax-related  assets  and  liabilities  require  significant  judgments  and  the  use  of estimates. Amounts of tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions and tax credits, including, but not limited to, estimates for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and  the  ability  to  utilize  tax  benefit  carryforwards,  such  as  net  operating  loss  and  tax  credit  carryforwards.  Actual  income  taxes  could  vary significantly  from  estimated  amounts  due  to  the  future  impacts  of,  among  other  things,  changes  in  tax  laws,  guidance  or  policies,  including changes in corporate income tax rates, the financial condition and results of operations of NEE and FPL, and the resolution of audit issues raised by taxing authorities. These factors, including the ultimate resolution of income tax matters, may result in material adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities, which could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's  and  FPL's  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  prospects  may  be  materially  adversely  affected  due  to adverse results of litigation.\n\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially affected by adverse results of litigation. Unfavorable resolution of legal or administrative proceedings in which NEE or FPL is involved or other future legal or administrative proceedings may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL.\n\n## Development and Operational Risks\n\nNEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could suffer if NEE and FPL do not proceed with projects  under  development  or  are  unable  to  complete  the  construction  of,  or  capital  improvements  to,  electric  generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities or other facilities on schedule or within budget.\n\nNEE's and FPL's ability to proceed with projects under development and to complete construction of, and capital improvement projects for, their electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities and other facilities on schedule and within budget may be adversely affected by escalating costs for materials and labor and regulatory compliance, inability to obtain or renew necessary licenses, rightsof-way,  permits  or  other  approvals  on  acceptable  terms  or  on  schedule,  disputes  involving  contractors,  labor  organizations,  land  owners, governmental  entities,  environmental  groups,  Native American  and  aboriginal  groups,  lessors,  joint  venture  partners  and  other  third  parties, negative publicity, transmission interconnection issues, supply chain disruptions and other factors. For example, the ability of NEE and FPL to develop  solar  generation  facilities  is  dependent  on  the  international  supply  chain  for  solar  panels  and  associated  equipment,  and  regulatory actions have caused minor, and could in the future cause material, disruptions in the ability of NEE and FPL to acquire solar panels on time and at acceptable costs. If any development project or construction or capital improvement project is not completed, is delayed or is subject to cost overruns, certain associated costs may not be approved for recovery or otherwise be recoverable through regulatory mechanisms that may be available,  and  NEE  and  FPL  could  become obligated to make delay or termination payments or become obligated for other damages under contracts, could experience the loss of tax credits or tax incentives, or delayed or diminished returns, and could be required to write off all or a portion  of  their  investment  in  the  project. Any  of  these  events  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  NEE's  and  FPL's  business,  financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE and FPL face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities.\n\nNEE and FPL own, develop, construct, manage and operate electric generation and transmission facilities and natural gas transmission facilities. A key component of NEE's and FPL's growth is their ability to construct and operate generation and transmission facilities to meet customer needs. As part of these operations, NEE and FPL must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various local, state, federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions. Should NEE or FPL be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms or resolving third-party challenges to such licenses or permits, should there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits or should regulatory authorities initiate any associated investigations or enforcement actions or impose related penalties or disallowances on NEE or FPL, NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. Any failure to negotiate successful project development agreements for new facilities with third parties could have similar results.\n\nThe  operation  and  maintenance  of  NEE's  and  FPL's  electric  generation,  transmission  and  distribution  facilities,  gas  infrastructure facilities, retail gas distribution system in Florida and other facilities are subject to many operational risks, the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and FPL's electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities, retail gas distribution system in Florida and other facilities are subject to many operational risks. Operational risks could result in, among other things, lost revenues due to prolonged outages, increased expenses due to monetary penalties or fines for compliance failures or legal claims, liability to third parties for property and personal injury damage or loss of life, a failure to perform under applicable power sales agreements or other agreements and associated loss of revenues from terminated agreements or liability for liquidated",

          "chunk_text": "## Impact of Weather\n\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure revenues are generally protected from the impact of weather fluctuations due to the regulatory mechanisms that are available in most service territories. In North Carolina, margin decoupling provides protection from both weather and other usage variations like conservation for residential and small and medium general service customers. Margin decoupling provides a set margin per customer independent of actual usage. In South Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky, weather normalization adjusts revenues either up or down depending on how much warmer or colder than normal a given month has been. Weather normalization adjustments occur from November through March in South Carolina, from October through April in Tennessee and from November through April in Kentucky. Duke Energy Ohio collects most of its non-fuel revenue through a fixed monthly charge that is not impacted by usage fluctuations that result from weather changes or conservation.\n\n## Competition\n\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure's businesses operate as the sole provider of natural gas service within their retail service territories. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure owns and operates facilities necessary to transport and distribute natural gas. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure earns retail margin on the transmission and distribution of natural gas and not on the cost of the underlying commodity. Services are priced by state commission-approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable natural gas service at fair prices.\n\nIn residential, commercial and industrial customer markets, natural gas distribution operations compete with other companies that supply energy, primarily electric companies, propane and fuel oil dealers, renewable energy providers and coal companies in relation to sources of energy for electric power plants, as well as nuclear energy. A significant competitive factor is price. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure's primary product competition is with electricity for heating, water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of natural gas or decreases in the price of other energy sources could negatively impact competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer. In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse economic or market conditions, including higher natural gas costs, could cause these customers to suspend business operations or to use alternative sources of energy in favor of energy sources with lower per-unit costs.\n\nHigher natural gas costs or decreases in the price of other energy sources may allow competition from alternative energy sources for applications that have traditionally used natural gas, encouraging some customers to move away from natural gas-fired equipment to equipment fueled by other energy sources. Competition between natural gas and other forms of energy is also based on efficiency, performance, reliability, safety and other non-price factors. Technological improvements in other energy sources and events that impair the public perception of the non-price attributes of natural gas could erode our competitive advantage. These factors in turn could decrease the demand for natural gas, impair our ability to attract new customers and cause existing customers to switch to other forms of energy or to bypass our systems in favor of alternative competitive sources. This could result in slow or no customer growth and could cause customers to reduce or cease using our product, thereby reducing our ability to make capital expenditures and otherwise grow our business, adversely affecting our earnings.\n\n## Pipeline and Storage Investments\n\nDuke Energy, through its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment, has a 7.5% equity ownership interest in Sabal Trail. Sabal Trail is a joint venture that owns the Sabal Trail Natural Gas Pipeline (Sabal Trail pipeline) to transport natural gas to Florida, regulated by FERC. The Sabal Trail Phase I mainline was placed into service in July 2017 and traverses Alabama, Georgia and Florida. The remaining lateral line to the Duke Energy Florida's Citrus County CC was placed into service in March 2018. Phase II of Sabal Trail went into service in May 2020, adding approximately 200,000 Dth of capacity to the Sabal Trail pipeline.\n\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 47% equity ownership interest in ACP, which planned to build the ACP pipeline, an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline. The ACP pipeline was intended to transport diverse natural gas supplies into southeastern markets and would be regulated by FERC. Dominion Energy owns 53% of ACP and was contracted to construct and operate the ACP pipeline upon completion. On July 5, 2020, Dominion announced a sale of substantially all of its gas transmission and storage segment assets, which were critical to the ACP pipeline. Further, permitting delays and legal challenges had materially affected the timing and cost of the pipeline. As a result, Duke Energy determined that they would no longer invest in the construction of the ACP pipeline.\n\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 24% equity ownership interest in Constitution, an interstate pipeline development company formed to develop, construct, own and operate a 124-mile natural gas pipeline and related facilities, regulated by FERC. Constitution was slated to transport natural gas supplies from the Marcellus supply region in northern Pennsylvania to major northeastern markets. As of February 5, 2020, the Constitution partners formally resolved to initiate the dissolution of Constitution, and to terminate the Constitution Pipeline project.\n\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 21.49% equity ownership interest in Cardinal, an intrastate pipeline located in North Carolina regulated by the NCUC, a 45% equity ownership in Pine Needle, an interstate liquefied natural gas storage facility located in North Carolina and a 50% equity ownership interest in Hardy Storage, an underground interstate natural gas storage facility located in Hardy and Hampshire counties in West Virginia. Pine Needle and Hardy Storage are regulated by FERC.\n\nKO Transmission Company (KO Transmission), a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio, is an interstate pipeline company engaged in the business of transporting natural gas and is subject to the rules and regulations of FERC. KO Transmission's 90-mile pipeline supplies natural gas to Duke Energy Ohio and interconnects with the Columbia Gulf Transmission pipeline and Tennessee Gas Pipeline. An approximately 70-mile portion of KO Transmission's pipeline facilities is co-owned by Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation.\n\nSee Notes 3, 12 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\" and \"Variable Interest Entities,\" respectively, for further information on Duke Energy's pipeline investments.\n\n## Inventory\n\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure must maintain adequate natural gas inventory in order to provide reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2021, the inventory balance for Gas Utilities and Infrastructure was $125 million. For more information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"",

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General\n\nSouthern Company is the parent company of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, SCS, Southern Linc, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional electric operating companies - Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power - are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states. Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities, including Nicor Gas (Illinois), Atlanta Gas Light (Georgia), Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas (Tennessee). Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, these businesses also included wholesale gas services. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. Southern Linc provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants, including Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and is currently managing construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure develops distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers. See Note 15 for information regarding the sale of Sequent.\n\nThe Registrants' financial statements reflect investments in subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The equity method is used for investments in entities in which a Registrant has significant influence but does not have control and for VIEs where a Registrant has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period. See \"Variable Interest Entities\" herein and Note 7 for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and certain other subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the FERC, and the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are also subject to regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. As such, the respective financial statements of the applicable Registrants reflect the effects of rate regulation in accordance with GAAP and comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by relevant state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Registrants' results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04.\n\nThe Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. While no material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each reflect their strategic positioning in solar power generation based on their 2024 energy mix disclosures, and what does this reveal about the varying emphasis on solar adoption across the utilities sector?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) reported that hydroelectric and solar together accounted for 1.9% of its total energy generation in 2024, showing limited reliance on solar as part of its energy mix. Southern Company (SO) has a more defined solar footprint, with a total solar capacity of 368,106 KW across multiple facilities in Georgia, indicating a more deliberate investment in solar infrastructure. In contrast, NextEra Energy (NEE) did not disclose any specific solar-related capacity or generation data in the provided evidence, which could suggest either a focus on other forms of renewable energy or a lack of material solar operations in the segment reviewed. The combination of these perspectives reveals that while some utilities are actively expanding solar generation, others either maintain a more traditional generation mix or prioritize alternative renewables without explicit solar disclosures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK \u2192 Solar Power: DUK's 2024 generation mix shows hydroelectric and solar combined at 1.9%, indicating minimal solar contribution.",
        "Hop 2: NEE \u2192 Solar Power: NEE's filing does not provide any specific data on solar power generation or capacity, suggesting either non-material involvement or undisclosed strategic focus.",
        "Hop 3: SO \u2192 Solar Power: SO reports a total solar capacity of 368,106 KW across 10 facilities in Georgia, demonstrating a more structured investment in solar infrastructure."

      "answer": "Duke Energy's 2023 SEC filing lists Lynn J. Good as Chief Executive Officer, Brian D. Savoy as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Cynthia S. Lee as Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, with signatures from directors Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, Lynn J. Good, and Brian D. Savoy dated February 23, 2024. NextEra Energy's filing identifies John W. Ketchum as Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, with director signatures dated February 16, 2024, though specific director names are not listed in the provided excerpt. Southern Power Company's filing names Christopher Cummiskey as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gary Kerr as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer, and Jelena Andrin as Vice President and Comptroller, with a full list of directors including Bryan D. Anderson, Stan W. Connally, and others dated February 14, 2024. These differences suggest varying levels of detail and transparency in governance disclosures, with Southern Power providing the most comprehensive director listing while NextEra Energy offers the least specific information in this context.",

      "question": "How do Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Southern Company (SO) each characterize their financial exposure and strategic approach to transmission facilities, and what does this reveal about their differing risk profiles and investment priorities?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) explicitly details its ownership stakes in various transmission and local facilities, reporting $7,252 million in property, plant, and equipment with $1,578 million in accumulated depreciation and $180 million in construction work in progress. These figures indicate a significant tangible investment in transmission infrastructure, with clear asset ownership and depreciation exposure. NextEra Energy (NEE) highlights its ownership and operation of rate-regulated transmission facilities as part of its broader clean energy and infrastructure strategy, signaling a strategic alignment with renewable energy deployment and energy trading. This suggests a forward-looking, market-driven approach to transmission with integration into broader clean energy assets. Southern Company (SO) discusses transmission facilities in the context of regulatory risk and long-term planning uncertainty, noting that cost recovery for new transmission assets is not guaranteed and may be subject to regulatory lag or market volatility. This reflects a more cautious perspective, where investment in transmission infrastructure is tied to regulatory approval and long-term load forecasting risks. When combined, these perspectives reveal distinct risk profiles: DUK emphasizes asset-heavy, depreciating infrastructure with clear financial commitments, NEE focuses on strategic integration of transmission with clean energy and market services, and SO highlights regulatory and demand-side uncertainties that could affect recovery of transmission-related costs.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) focuses its audit-related services on statutory reporting requirements and internal control assessments, with all services preapproved by the Audit Committee under a strict policy. NextEra Energy (NEE) includes internal control assessments related to pre-implementation financial systems and also engaged Deloitte for training and advisory services in 2023, with a delegated approval process for services under $500,000. Southern Company (SO) highlights a broader range of audit-related services, including internal control reviews tied to system implementations and extensive sustainability-related attestations such as GHG emissions and sustainability bond expenditures. Together, this shows that while all three companies rely on Deloitte for internal controls, SO places a stronger emphasis on ESG-related attestation services compared to DUK and NEE.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy reported a decrease in its total environmental remediation reserves from $88 million in 2023 to $73 million in 2024, indicating a reduction in estimated outstanding obligations. However, NextEra Energy (NEE) did not disclose any specific environmental remediation reserves or liabilities in its 2024 filing, suggesting either minimal obligations or a different reporting structure for such liabilities. Similarly, Southern Company (SO) also did not provide specific figures for environmental remediation reserves in its 2024 filing, offering no direct comparison on the scale or trend of such obligations. This contrast reveals that Duke Energy is more transparent and potentially carries a more defined or active environmental remediation burden compared to NEE and SO, whose filings do not disclose specific remediation liabilities, making it difficult to assess their relative scale or trajectory.",
